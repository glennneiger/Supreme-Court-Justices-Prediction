            <text syncTime="68.894" offset="427230">This case involves the federal wiretapping statute, and in particular, the provision of that statute that deals with the requirement that at the termination of interceptions or extensions thereof, a judge must seal the wiretap... the products of the wiretap or oral interceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.606" offset="506015">I'll use the term "wiretap", if I may, just as a shorthand to cover both wiretaps and oral interceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.426" offset="537362">The case arose from a lengthy 16-month wiretap investigation in Puerto Rico, where a total of about a thousand, somewhat in excess of a thousand, tapes were generated in the course of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.221" offset="600474">When the prosecution was initiated in Connecticut, the defendants moved to suppress the wiretap evidence on a large number of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.577" offset="641956">The district court denied the vast bulk of those grounds, but granted the suppression motion in part with respect to two groups of tapes on one ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.183" offset="680408">And that ground was that the tapes with... those two sets of tapes had not been sealed quickly enough after the termination of the interceptions and the extensions, as the district court construed the term 2518(8)(a) of the wiretap statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.273" offset="3732764">The statute really had its origin in the task force report on organized crime in 1970... 67 of President Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.498" offset="3773620">There was a draft statute in the appendix of that report which turns out to be very close to what ultimately became Title III.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.826" offset="3958985">"The presence of the seal, noted above, the judicial seal, is intended to be a prerequisite for use unless a satisfactory explanation can be made to the judge. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.080" offset="8987974">It created a prophylactic rule, and it's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.148" offset="9000199">And I think the question of whether or not there is a prejudice test can also be answered by thinking about did Congress know how to create a prejudice test, if it desired to do so in a rule of exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2226.158" offset="9056310">If one takes a look at other statutes in the area of criminal law... for example, the Speedy Trial Act, Section 3162(b), I believe it is, which this Court reviewed recently in the Taylor case... what that test in that section is, Congress said in a district court in determining whether or not an indictment should he dismissed with or without prejudice shall consider the following factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.672" offset="9146276">There Congress created a prejudice test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.523" offset="9153695">Alternatively, in the Jenks Act, Section 3500, Congress created a mandatory exclusion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.427" offset="9181385">If the government elects not to comply with an order of the Court to turn over evidence, either the testimony is stricken or, if the court determines it is in the interest of justice, a mistrial is ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.168" offset="9228301">Some of us may disagree, but that's what Congress said.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.019" offset="12303749">It's not a perfect statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.638" offset="12310227">It doesn't prohibit tampering, but it was designed to avoid the opportunity for tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.208" offset="12332483">And that's the critical problem... one of the critical problems with the government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.743" offset="12346590">The government says the sole purpose is tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.362" offset="12357039">That's not the sole purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.812" offset="12362890">There are a number of purposes and they are set forth in the legislative history and they include the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.682" offset="12382325">Number one, Congress intended to create immediate direct judicial supervision over wiretap evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.394" offset="12453169">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.944" offset="12455363">That's ultimate statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.680" offset="12462364">But what Congress did was, looking at that ultimate statutory purpose, Congress decided the best most effective way to approach that ultimate goal of the statute is to have that judicial supervision to reduce the opportunities for tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.170" offset="12520356">Congress knew it couldn't avoid all tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.622" offset="12530178">The government argues that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.724" offset="12534567">If... if a prosecutor or a law enforcement agent is bent on tampering with evidence, he's going to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.211" offset="12560480">And Congress knew it couldn't avoid that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.845" offset="12567063">But what it decided is... we're going to create this standard to say to the government, you got to turn them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.115" offset="12588066">And that judicial supervision is going to reduce the incentive and the opportunity for tampering with those tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.138" offset="12616173">And it responded as well to this Court... as I was referring to earlier, to this Court's rulings in Berger and Katz, where one of the problems with the statute, the New York State statute, was... and the Court noted there was no return to a judicial officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.278" offset="12664761">The same problem noted in Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.814" offset="12674897">That was one of the problems specifically referred to in the congressional history in the Senate report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.949" offset="12695481">In addition, Congress was concerned about the potential abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.753" offset="12710632">It was clear at that time in 1968, when the statute was passed, that wiretap was a dangerous area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.574" offset="12733933">It was ripe for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.274" offset="12740725">And Congress was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.859" offset="12747099">And what the decision was... and it may not be a decision which every single member of this Court agrees is the right line, but they created a line... immediate sealing upon the expiration of the orders or extensions thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.584" offset="12794015">And it's a line they drew, and it's an appropriate line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.684" offset="12802374">It may not be the perfect line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.202" offset="12808434">The... and so I think that that's... even if you get to the question of statutory purpose in legislative history, it aids our view, not the government's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.474" offset="12845528">There are two other points that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.593" offset="12853992">Number one, the government's test, if adopted by this Court, is going to require tampering hearings in every district court, in every sealing violation, regardless of whether it's a short delay where the government's explanation may be very, very reasonable, because what they're asking the Court to do is define satisfactory explanation as no tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.221" offset="12932568">Once that definition is established, in cases where the test created by the Second Circuit is in fact very, very helpful to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.827" offset="12962975">And the test applied has been extremely liberally... liberally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.296" offset="12980843">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.647" offset="12982201">Under the government's theory, we're going to have tampering hearings, and experts coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.849" offset="12999024">And that, in some ways addresses the question that Justice O'Connor raised, which is this case has gone on for years and years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.753" offset="13026609">And does this Court want to create a standard where you are going to compel district courts to have those kind of hearings?</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.240" offset="13048552">The hearings that occurred here that were not satisfying, the district court made no finding on any of the excluded tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.311" offset="13076869">There is no finding that those tapes were not tampered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.779" offset="13090766">None at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.048" offset="13095781">He only found them with the tapes that were not excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.433" offset="13109365">Finally, in conclusion, the... the government came first before this Court in its petition for certiorari on page 11 and the government said in that petition, this is a serious problem because despite the best efforts of a supervising attorney in a wiretap case, there will be occasions on which the tapes will not be immediately sealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.448" offset="13201421">Congress agreed with that and that's why they created a satisfactory explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.400" offset="13217199">But as the delays get longer, you need a better and better reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.102" offset="13232036">But the problem, and the Second Circuit has adopted that approach... it is an approach which allows the best efforts of a supervising attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.958" offset="13263488">What the government is effectively asking this Court to do today is to rewrite the statute to avoid separation of powers issues... to avoid issues of judicial restraint... all so that we can... protect the negligent, sometimes willful, sloppy, intentional bad faith conduct of officers of the United States Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.788" offset="13350841">That, we believe, is a road that this Court should not travel down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.775" offset="13366723">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="3310.863" offset="13395040">Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.631" offset="13402146">The first point I'd like to make quickly is each of the courts already requires us to show, as part of a satisfactory explanation, that there was no tampering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.369" offset="13433074">So, there's not going to be any great increase in the numbers of these hearings since that's already a requirement that we have to satisfy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.058" offset="13459824">The question is do we have to do more by way of establishing a satisfactory explanation for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.426" offset="13477378">The second point is the Gigante case, which is the only other case in which there has been suppression at the court of appeals level that I am aware of, was a case in which we had no explanation for the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.282" offset="13516771">It wasn't a satisfactory explanation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.317" offset="13524921">And third, and most important, the... teasing out the argument that, well, you have to look at how long the delay was, why the delay was, and that there was a pattern of delays, in this case in quite unfair because there was one legal mistake, the construction of the term "extension".</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.629" offset="13594198">That's what resulted in the long delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.331" offset="13604960">Every day that passed was not compounding the felony because this was somebody who was... believed he was secure in his construction of the term "extension".</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.761" offset="13690642">Now, the district court did not find gross negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.846" offset="13699001">The district court did find negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.663" offset="13706315">But we would submit that where the Second Circuit in one of its own opinions, in the Principie case, had found that moving from place A when the target moves to place B and getting another order for place B, when that is an extension, his construction of the statute was not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.975" offset="13771517">It couldn't be unreasonable because the very court that ruled in this case had previously said that that's what extension means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.561" offset="13797848">Now, the court distinguished that case in this case by saying, well, but that was the word 2518(8)(d) dealing with inventory service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.352" offset="13841003">And also, there was no gap between the two orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.138" offset="13856154">Therefore, that could be an extension and this, it would be unreasonable to suppose, would be... would be an extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.542" offset="13877783">But it... the word has to mean the same thing in both subsections of the same provision, and we submit, therefore, that it wasn't unreasonable for him to draw that conclusion.</text>
