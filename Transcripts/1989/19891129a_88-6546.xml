            <text syncTime="15.172" offset="203999">The issue in this case is whether an American citizen can be submitted to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribe even though he is not a member of the tribe simply because he or she is an Indian; or, should they be treated like Mr. Oliphant and other non-members with whom they are similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.444" offset="289158">Albert Duro, the Petitioner in this case, is a California Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.889" offset="310892">He is a member of the Torez-Martinez band of Mission Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.761" offset="326357">He was raised in California on private land and is a permanent resident of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.537" offset="349449">He is not a member of, nor is he eligible for membership in the Salt River Tribe, who is the Respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.353" offset="384766">For approximately three months in 1984, Albert Duro stayed on the Salt River reservation with his girlfriend, who is also from California.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.518" offset="421442">During June of 1984, a firearm discharged and accidentally shot a 14-year-old boy that was riding a bicycle approximately two blocks away, undoubtedly an unfortunate incident.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.623" offset="573788">The government has never refiled that charge against Mr. Duro.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.346" offset="588731">Two days after the case was dismissed in federal court, the federal marshals turned Mr. Duro over to the Salt River Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.213" offset="628228">He was charged in the Salt River Tribe with discharge of firearms, which is a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.038" offset="659470">A motion to dismiss was filed by Mr. Duro in the Salt River Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.502" offset="681308">That motion was denied by Judge Manuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.484" offset="693325">We then filed a habeas corpus petition before the federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.969" offset="719238">Judge Copple, who the Court may remember was the district court judge involved in the Wheeler decision and upheld by this Court, issued a writ of habeas corpus in favor of Mr. Duro.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.697" offset="762079">That was appealed by the Respondent to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.889" offset="778902">The Ninth Circuit, in a 2-1 decision with Judge Sneed dissenting, held that non-member Indians, unlike non-Indians, are subject to the criminal jurisdiction of an Indian tribe if they have significant contacts with the reservation; not if the crime involves significant contacts with the reservation but merely whether or not the person involved has significant contacts with the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.881" offset="2298915">It was within the contemplation of Congress at that time that the Western Territory would be created.</text>

Lee infringement test has been applied by this Court to stop with membership; it is the bright line that this Court has continuously used throughout to define the integrity of self-government versus the interest of some other government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.369" offset="4568851">The interest in this case could be the state or the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.551" offset="4581599">The argument for the Federal Government is that they have, through treaties, had an obligation to exercise jurisdiction over intratribal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.331" offset="4628619">So if 1152 is construed to mean something other than membership in a tribe, then the United States is allowed to abrogate in a sense its treaty obligations with numerous tribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.828" offset="5674667">Let first say that there's a very good argument that Mr. Duro's ancestors were citizens to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo or at least entitled to citizen... citizenship rights; therefore, he... his people could have been a citizen in 1848.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.358" offset="5728793">But to answer the question directly, I think things have changed now.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.227" offset="5960237">It's important to point out that it was a compromise, that it allowed traditions and customs of the tribe which is unique to each tribe to be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.370" offset="6148842">And, of course, the Fifth Amendment grand jury requirement doesn't apply to Indian tribes either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.375" offset="6576832">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.590" offset="6597730">Albert Duro came onto the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian community reservation with his girlfriend, lived with her, lived with her there for three and a half months, worked for the PiCopa Construction Company, a wholly-owned company by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian community, subjected himself to the laws of the community by committing an offense under the laws of the community and the possession of alcohol and marijuana, pled guilty to the charge brought by the community, was found guilty and was fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.942" offset="6743075">Thereafter, the incident of the firing of the gun took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.258" offset="6764391">He was indicated by the federal grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.601" offset="6777766">That indictment was later dismissed with prejudice, and he was charged by the Salt River community in that offense which resulted in the death of a 14-year-old boy who was a member of the Gila River Indian community, which interestingly enough, is also a community made up of Pima and Maricopa Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.317" offset="6864597">The young boy was a resident of the Maricopa... of the... of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.392" offset="6892913">The issue here, I think, is whether the jurisdiction and powers of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian community, which it clearly and without a doubt had at the time of American sovereignty, that is to try and, if guilty... found guilty, to punish offenders against its law, have been diminished since American sovereignty, either by incompatibility with the nature of the dependent status of the Salt River Indian community, or by explicit federal enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.128" offset="7063859">There have been no explicit federal enactments which, I would submit, limit the jurisdiction of the community in regard to Albert Duro or to such an offender.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.919" offset="7179006">The civil rights equal protection provision says that they will not deny equal protection to anyone within its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.845" offset="7218713">Non-Indians are not within the jurisdiction of the Salt River community court since Oliphant and, assumably, before that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.967" offset="7639179">It has obviously been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.551" offset="7649524">The... that whole unit of... of... of jurisdical powers has been changed by federal legislation so that, under the Major Crimes Act, federal jurisdiction is had over certain kinds of enumerated crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.323" offset="7724652">Under the Indian Country Crimes Act and Assimilated Crimes Act, certain acts committed by Indians against non-Indians are in federal court jurisdiction to the exclusion of tribal court jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.956" offset="7911166">Now the Indian Reorganization Act as well speaks of Indian by blood quantum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.819" offset="7934572">I think that is not a... in practice something which still exists as an enrollment characteristic in tribal constitutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.871" offset="8002804">I don't know if I'd use that word, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think that the answer is yes, and I think that, for instance, this Court, in Morton v. Mancari, did the same thing or recognized that principle when it upheld the Indian preference law on the grounds that Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, even though they are not members of the tribes to which they are assigned, would benefit those tribes in their... in their ability to govern themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.913" offset="8134984">So that fungibility, if the word is fungibility, I think is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.205" offset="8148149">So what we have is a pattern beginning from before American sovereignty, a pattern where there have been changes, there have been restrictions on Indian jurisdiction, tribal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.097" offset="8215754">And this Court and the executive have noted from time to time what those restrictions are not, because if you have a whole and you've taken pieces out of it and you've said this is in federal court, you leave something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.270" offset="8284404">And what has been left, as the Court on a couple of occasions has said, is for the... for the Indian tribes to deal with these questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.735" offset="10318298">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.301" offset="10360512">Our submission here is based on this Court's analysis in the Oliphant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.029" offset="10407428">Here, as there, there has been no express divestiture of jurisdiction in the tribe by either treaty or statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.659" offset="10458001">Some reference has been made to early treaty provisions which had so-called depredation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.036" offset="10507529">Those provided that, rather than engage in warfare with other tribes, compensation would be available for depredations committed by members of other tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.788" offset="10570536">They were not treaty provisions written in terms of conferring criminal jurisdiction on the Federal Government to prosecute those persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.188" offset="10616094">They provided either for an arbitration process under the auspices of the President of the United States to provide compensation for such depredations or, in some instances, for compensation from the federal Treasury in return for the Indians' agreement not to engage in warfare with other tribes as a result of such so-called depredations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.246" offset="10724345">So there has been no express divestiture of the jurisdiction here, and the question is whether its retention is subject to an implied divestiture because it would be incompatible with the status of the tribes as dependent limited sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.041" offset="10811490">The Court concluded in Oliphant that there was such an implied divestiture because of the long historical understanding that the jurisdiction over non-Indians did not exist and because the Federal Government by statute had assumed jurisdiction to prosecute those offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.257" offset="10904381">The same considerations quite clearly, it seems to us, lead to the opposite conclusion here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.287" offset="14096440">There's no compelling reason for this Court to add another crazy patch to the quiltwork of Indian law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.201" offset="14120159">The bright line that's been established by this Court in not going back to Rogers but in United States v. Wheeler should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.908" offset="14150984">Rogers doesn't control this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.541" offset="14157462">Oliphant and Wheeler do, but not just language in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.224" offset="14172195">The rationale of those cases apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.484" offset="14181286">Let me clear up some confusion I may have caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.507" offset="14193406">We are suggesting one solution is to read 1152 to mean member on member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.442" offset="14213155">We still believe that 1153, the Major Crimes Act, would apply to any Indian on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.707" offset="14238128">Heretofore, that has not meant enrolled member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.868" offset="14250771">That is not a definition as Congress used... has used, and we don't believe that that has been applied in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.983" offset="14275326">You'd have to rewrite all the federal statutes in order to gain this argument for the Respondents so that you can shift one void to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.191" offset="14308136">It's clear, I think the Court can see, from the questioning thus far there's not... you're not going to avoid a void by deciding this case in a certain way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.079" offset="14355679">I believe 1152... and just not my opinion but the legislative history, we believe, supports that it should be member on member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.454" offset="14389116">The tribal court would have jurisdiction over member on member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.038" offset="14407506">If it's a non-member crime, it goes into federal court or into state court if they can... if they can argue, in a subsequent case, that the state interest is great enough to extend the McBratney line of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.437" offset="14453064">But what about an enrolled Indian who says I want out and I opt out and he's no longer an enrolled member and doesn't want to be?</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.393" offset="14496949">What about 1153?</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.366" offset="14504786">He would still be an Indian, wouldn't he?</text>

            <label>Mr. John Trebon</label>
            <text syncTime="3592.757" offset="14514399">Of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.978" offset="14515235">He's an Indian by federal definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.991" offset="14523281">If he's over... if he's over 25 percent Indian blood under some definitions he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.683" offset="14542089">Under the Indian Reorganization Act, if he's over 50 percent blood, he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.216" offset="14556195">And this Court I hope is not going to create an incentive for enrolled Indians to disenfranchise themselves with their own tribes in order to gain equal rights with other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.943" offset="14603111">I mean, hopefully we get back to the position sometime in this case that Mr. Duro and Mr. Oliphant are exactly the same except for one fact: one's an Indian and one is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.842" offset="14646683">Why should we treat them differently?</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.874" offset="14658804">This Court in the United States... in Antelope didn't say that you could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.835" offset="14674686">Indians are tried under 1153 in federal court, and so are non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.580" offset="14693704">They're both accorded the same rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.752" offset="14698301">There was no racial classification created in Antelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.264" offset="14712407">Federal jurisdiction was exercised over both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.586" offset="14721707">Here, tribal jurisdiction would be exercised over one group but not another, even though they're generally within the class of non-members simply because one is an Indian and one is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.894" offset="14770922">The analysis is pretty cohesive if you apply the same rationale that you used in Wheeler, that you used in Oliphant, that you've used in Rice v. Rehner, that you use in the tax cases, that you use when you applied the Williams v. Lee infringement test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.475" offset="14841243">In all cases, the same rationale applies here, and tribal government is preserved, in fact greater so, because the tribe can still continue to exercise not only jurisdiction over its own members but they can apply the customs and traditions and mores that they have always applied in tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.788" offset="14914491">They don't have to have the Bill of Rights applying to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.150" offset="14927970">We don't have to destroy tribal sovereignty in order to gain jurisdiction over this void.</text>
