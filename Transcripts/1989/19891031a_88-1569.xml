            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132566">We'll hear argument first this afternoon in Number 88-1569, Richard H. Austin v. the Michigan Chamber of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.927" offset="172272">Mr. Caruso.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_j_caruso" startTime="11.828" stopTime="198.502">
            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="11.828" offset="179795">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.591" offset="194842">The issue in this case is whether a provision in the Michigan Campaign Finance Act that prohibits independent expenditures from being made in candidate elections from the general treasuries of corporations is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.671" offset="263178">The Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit membership corporation, contends that it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.629" offset="302989">The district court, the trial court, sustained the validity of the Act and disagreed with the Chamber.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.432" offset="326290">The court of appeals, Sixth Circuit, reversed, holding that as applied to the Chamber, the provision violates the Chamber's First Amendment free speech rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.810" offset="371743">This Court has said in earlier cases that the government's interest in regulating the activity of... political activity of corporations are sufficiently important to justify such regulations when the means are closely drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.522" offset="438617">The prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption in the electoral process by a legislative scheme aimed in part at corporations reflects a legislative judgment that the special characteristics of a corporation require particularly careful regulation and should be given considerable deference by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.517" offset="530568">It is Michigan's position that the potential danger from corporate independent expenditures in connection with candidate elections poses a sufficient compelling interest that permits Michigan to regulate those corporations that do not fall within the exception set out by this Court in Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, that the Chamber is unlike that corporation the Court dealt with in MCFL and may be regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.968" offset="660344">Now, I am not unmindful that in Buckley and in National Conservative Political Action cases, that the Court struck down independent limitations on independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.936" offset="716246">However, in Buckley, the Court dealt with individuals and groups, and not with corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.621" offset="742995">And in the NCPAC case, the spending limits applied to any group, association, as well as corporations, all impermissibly, as the court said, lumped together.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.018" offset="788553">The court found the regulation in NCPAC over inclusive, and not narrowly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.542" offset="810705">And the group at which the regulation was aimed was not regulated... historically was not regulated to justify deference by the court to legislative judgment in that case, as the court had done in National Right to Work case when it permitted inclusion of nonprofit corporations in the legislative regulatory scheme to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.886" offset="904014">Here the prohibition applies only to corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.409" offset="978202">They are not included when you read the particular language.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.952" offset="992308">If a labor union is incorporated, it is included.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.614" offset="1002966">As a matter of fact, I believe there are 22 major labor unions in the State of Michigan incorporated, including the MEA, and they are included.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.119" offset="1037030">And with respect to not including them expressly, whether they are incorporated or not incorporated, this Court has said many times we defer to legislative judgment as to those entities that require regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.711" offset="1107351">There may be some entities that pose the same problem and the same potential threat to the electoral process as do corporations, but we defer to the legislative judgment in this area, and that, and perhaps at some particular time the legislature may see fit to include labor unions, labor unions if they are not incorporated, but they have not done so at this time.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="268.527" offset="1206617">General Caruso, why is there a greater risk to the political process from an independent political expenditure by a family corporation, closely held corporation, eight family members, and they want to spend the corporation's money for a particular candidate whom they think will favor their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.079" offset="1284879">That... that is prohibited by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.212" offset="1293343">But if Donald Trump wants to come in and spend as much money as he likes, that is perfectly all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.475" offset="1314450">Why wouldn't it make much more sense, if you are worried about the problem, to establish an amount of money as the criterion?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis J. Caruso</label>
            <text syncTime="305.910" offset="1356142">Well, the Court has viewed that political corporations, that corporations are given by state authorities certain benefits by virtue of the corporate form.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.179" offset="1397206">They are given certain benefits in respect of liability, certain benefits in respect of taxes, certain benefits in respect of perpetual life.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.213" offset="1429389">And what this Court has seen in the past, that that... the legislature has seen this and has provided against their taking advantage of that... those particular advantages given to corporations and turning them into an advantage in the electoral process and in the political arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.867" offset="1511936">Now, the Court has said that the legislature's judgment in this area is one that we will defer to.</text>
