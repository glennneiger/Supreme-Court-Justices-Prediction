            <text syncTime="7.443" offset="116795">Well, this case coming to us from the Eleventh Circuit concern so-called voluntary admissions to a Florida state mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.361" offset="160472">In a sense, it is related to the Washington against Harper decision announced this morning by Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.923" offset="190774">The respondent signed forms requesting the admission and treatment at the hospital, and this was an apparent compliance with state statutes, but after his release he brought this action under 1983, a federal statute, against petitioners who were physicians and staff members of the hospital on the ground that they had deprived him of his liberty without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.913" offset="290771">The complaint alleged that they violated state law by admitting Burch as a voluntary patient when they knew or should have known that he was incompetent to give informed consent and that their failure to initiate Florida’s involuntary placement procedure denied him constitutionally guaranteed procedural safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.646" offset="377602">The District Court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss under cases holding that a depravation of a protected interest caused by a state employee’s random and unauthorized conduct does not give rise to such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.049" offset="439251">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.446" offset="452834">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.976" offset="471016">We hold that the complaint was sufficient to state a claim under 1983 for violation of the plaintiff’s procedural due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.572" offset="509363">The case is to which the District Court relied to, do not preclude respondent’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.431" offset="536844">It is foreseeable that persons requesting treatment might be incapable of informed consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.461" offset="564952">Justice O’Connor has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Kennedy.</text>
