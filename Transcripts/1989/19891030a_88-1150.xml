            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="9.457" offset="188535">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.262" offset="215703">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.564" offset="220927">The issues in this case are important ones regarding the nature and extent of federal judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.448" offset="252483">The Eighth Circuit has held that a federal court, in seeking to remedy a constitutional violation, can give higher authority for state taxes than state law allows, and it further has held that the district court properly exercised that authority in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.819" offset="321969">We think that the court of appeals was wrong on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.733" offset="337642">In our view, a federal court can't authorize a government to tax its citizens without its consent, and it certainly can't do so without showing that no other remedy and no other means of financing is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.512" offset="392708">xx before turning to the merits, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the issue of jurisdiction in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.375" offset="424160">The basic issue seems to us pretty straightforward: did the court of appeals treat our rehearing petition, which sought en banc review, as a petition for rehearing as well as one for en banc?</text>
            <text syncTime="81.765" offset="477763">If it did, and several circuits have made an express practice of treating petitions this way, then it seems clear to us that under the rules the time for seeking review in this Court was tolled until after the petition was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.916" offset="538367">Now, the Eighth Circuit has said itself how it treated this particular petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.909" offset="562295">In an order that it entered nunc pro tunc it said that it had denied petitions for rehearing with suggestions for rehearing en banc, and it corrected its earlier order to reflect that fact.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="116.066" stopTime="142.163">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="116.066" offset="614958">Mr. Farr, we occasionally run into a situation here where a court of appeals or a state court will enter a judgment nunc pro tunc where the Petitioner has had his time for certiorari expire just so that the person will be able to petition in what they think is a timely manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.470" offset="688519">This would be somewhat disturbing, I think, if there were any thought that the court of appeals had just kind of given a break to your client.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.163" offset="719343">Well, Your Honor, I don't think there's any reason to treat the order in that particular way for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.268" offset="739719">First of all, there's certainly nothing on the face of the order or anything that it suggests that it is simply doing that as an accommodation to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.740" offset="765632">Secondly, it is in fact the regular practice of the Eighth Circuit to treat petitions for rehearing en banc as petitions for rehearing with suggestions for rehearing en banc, just as several other circuits do, as I say, express a--</text>

            <text syncTime="223.678" offset="1045352">Now, I would say, though, I don't think that in any sense the court of appeals are or should be limited by what is specifically asked for in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.222" offset="1079520">As I say, in these other circuits which do have it as an express matter of rule, there is no requirement that, in order for the rule to come into play, you actually have to have said, I would like rehearing from the panel, in the process of applying for rehearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.532" offset="1136780">They simply have decided as a matter of internal court business that that would be the more flexible way to deal with these, in fact, I think to eliminate some of the confusion that has arisen out of problems like this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.573" offset="1744911">Well, that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.674" offset="1749404">There's no question, this Court has to determine whether to give effect to the order of the Eighth Circuit or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.427" offset="1768317">I'm not saying that... that that is not an issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.318" offset="1779915">What I am saying, though, is that there is no good reason not to give effect to the order of the Eighth Circuit, because it is reflecting its practice, and what the Eighth Circuit says, at least in its order, was in fact what it did in this case, and I don't think there's any reason to second-guess the Eighth Circuit on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.921" offset="1846370">One other point I would make, at least as some independent evidence to suggest that the Eighth Circuit is not engaging in some sort of device or sham, here, is what happened with the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.745" offset="1885659">Under the rules of... the federal Appellate Procedure Rule 35, the mandate would not automatically be stayed simply by a petition or suggestion for rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.426" offset="1932366">But there's no question, in this case, that the mandate was automatically stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.557" offset="1948875">There is no order staying that, but the mandate did not issue until after the petition was denied, so we think that what the court's order says is consistent with, in fact, the way the court showed it treated the petition at the time the petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.298" offset="2011882">Now, turning to the merits, as I have said, the case involves questions first about whether federal courts can ever give authority for higher state taxes and, second, whether they could do so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.027" offset="2074785">And these questions involve, I think, some common issues about just what judicial power is and how it ought to be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.963" offset="2106550">I begin with what I think are two relatively uncontroversial propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.876" offset="2134135">First of all, that the federal courts do have broad remedial powers to correct for constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.583" offset="2164960">The second point, however, is that that power is subject to limitation, in particular, limitations that are drawn from the Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.068" offset="2206965">And these limitations can be of different kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.171" offset="2223370">For example, they can be absolute limitations, ones that completely bar the use of judicial power in a particular circumstance, or they can be more flexible.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.518" offset="2264748">They can be limitations that allow the courts to exercise power but require the courts to take account of other important institutional interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.616" offset="2305081">Now, for example, in the first category I think a federal court simply could not tell a senator or a congressman to refrain from activities which are protected under the speech and debate clause, and in fact the Court so held in Eastland v. U.S.S. F in 421 U.S. Nor do we think a federal court could tell the President that it had to appoint a particular Cabinet official.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.731" offset="2405600">Sovereign immunity, where it applies, can be an absolute barrier to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.707" offset="2429528">But then there are other doctrines which fall under the second category, doctrines like comity and judicial restraint, which... which do require the courts to give weight to other branches of government or, in the case of comity, to state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.866" offset="2494103">It's simply not correct, therefore, as a starting point for this discussion, to say that a federal court can always bring about a particular result, or should always bring about a particular result in a case before it, and indeed, the particular case cited by the Eighth Circuit for the idea that courts generally must have the power to carry out their particular orders is Marbury v. Madison, a case in which this Court held that it did not have the power under Article 3 to give the relief that the litigants sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.460" offset="2636522">Now, what has happened in this particular case is that the courts below have ventured into new ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.157" offset="2675288">We believe for the first time ever, a federal court has authorized a government to assess and levy taxes that its citizens haven't authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.634" offset="2721159">There seem to be some very good reasons, and I will discuss them, why this power may be absolutely beyond the reach of the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.254" offset="2835680">I think they're both improper, but just to save quibbling over it, I think what in fact happened is that the district court ordered the school district to levy the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.427" offset="2864414">The Eighth Circuit then essentially said well, we will authorize, we will change this slightly so that we will authorize the school district to levy the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.444" offset="2900463">There is no question, however, that if the school district said, now that we've been authorized to levy the tax, we've decided not to levy it, that an order would be forthcoming, at least under the way the courts below have treated it to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.222" offset="2947588">So I think that the authorization is in fact one that is backed up by the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.560" offset="4936865">And I think that is the thing that is so troubling about an order that involves the power to tax is that, in this particular case, what it says to the state is... or says to the school district... you have authority now from the court itself to levy a tax that the citizens have not given you authority to levy... in fact, it specifically denied you the authority to levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.397" offset="5028294">And the idea of taxation without representation, which is of course a catchy slogan, but I think it's something more than that, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.762" offset="5061730">I think it's rooted in the idea that the power to take property from citizens... the government's power to take that property is... is exercised through elected representatives and not through courts, unless there is individual adjudications, which of course we don't have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.010" offset="5126723">So, the... that is the principle that the state does believe is one that is... is worth preserving and that its laws simply shouldn't be set aside because the court feels that that would be a more convenient way of achieving its goal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.444" offset="5376454">The courts have been able to find remedies that will work and be effective without a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.247" offset="5395680">But logically that's... that is the ultimate extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.598" offset="5405084">But that is of course the logical point that one gets to any time one puts any limits on judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.922" offset="5430370">One can always look at a... the particular exercise of power and say, if there weren't limits on these powers, we could quash the subpoena that the House subcommittee has issued, for example, which may infringe somebody's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.479" offset="5476555">That is... so that is why you only obviously limit judicial power when the institutional considerations are of extreme importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.236" offset="5515634">But we think they are of extreme importance in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.438" offset="5528382">So that's the first point that we are making, that that power simply does not exist in federal courts, even, as you posit, in the most extreme case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.963" offset="5558475">The second question, though, the second point we are putting, is that as an exercise of power, of equity and comity, that this is not the extreme case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.250" offset="5599644">If anything, it's the extreme case the other way, that the court essentially put itself into this whole and then said, having gotten into it, that there were only two ways to extricate itself, the tax and perhaps levying it all on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.009" offset="5654710">And we don't believe that that process should be looked at once the hole is dug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.092" offset="5671010">Now I would say one... one more word about power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.466" offset="5700477">I have made the point, I think, that the power, in and of itself, is an extraordinary power, but I think it can't just be viewed in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.105" offset="5743108">I think the other thing that this claim of power does is it concentrates, in the federal court, a range of powers that are really quite extraordinary, beginning with the power to declare what the Constitution means... the power, of course, that everybody concedes... to the power to issue orders for particular programs, orders than require state and local officials or federal officials, in some cases, to comply and implement those programs, and ultimately, now, the ability of the courts to try to go out and get the citizens to support these programs beyond the power that they have already given to their elected representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.360" offset="5904127">That is a concentration, I believe, that is well beyond the idea of judicial power that is embodied in article three, which anticipated that courts obviously would have important power, but that power would be distributed, not just among the courts themselves, but among and... and between other branches of government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.246" offset="6659693">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.743" offset="6701593">If this Court finds that it has jurisdiction in this case, and we believe there is a very serious question on that which I would like to address first, but the fundamental issue on the merits of the case is whether the court below properly exercised its power, its discretion and, we believe, its responsibility to ensure the implementation and the funding of the remedy determined by the court to be necessary to correct a clearly proven constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.474" offset="6832519">Now, turning first to the jurisdictional issue, we think that the clerk of this Court was correct in his initial determination that the 90-day statutory time limit for filing petitions for writ of certiorari had run before any petition was filed and, thus, that there was a jurisdictional bar from this Court considering the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.790" offset="6929799">The state now relies basically on the nunc pro tunc order that was issued just a very few days after this clerk's... this Court's clerk's determination, where the Eighth Circuit declared that it had denied petitions for rehearing and petitions for rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.535" offset="7008793">This Court, in the Credit Company v. Arkansas Central Railway case, stated clearly that jurisdiction in this Court cannot be created by an order of a lower court or by a nunc pro tunc determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.093" offset="7071069">The fact is, the very plain fact is that the state did not file a petition for rehearing below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1780.506" offset="7272734">If the state had filed a timely petition for rehearing regardless of how it was characterized, we would concede that the time... the time would be tolled even... even regardless of the phrasing of the Eighth Circuit's rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.439" offset="7596444">It simply said we have in front of us a petition for rehearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.829" offset="8082008">I think they can amend the panel opinion sua sponte or based on a petition, and a new panel opinion would be a new judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.914" offset="8114295">And under the language of the statute and of this Court's rules, a new judgment provides 90 days for a new cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.709" offset="8145538">However, if a party is relying on the timely filing of a petition for rehearing to toll the time and the judgment hasn't been changed, there's no new judgment, we submit that the issue is whether a petition for rehearing was filed; and just as in the Credit Company v. Arkansas Central Railway case, I believe the fact is that the Eighth Circuit's opinion does not accurately describe what's at page 489 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.309" offset="8259850">And I think that the state has in essence acknowledged that they did not file what they intended to be a petition for rehearing by the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.104" offset="8299033">Now the question of whether the Eighth Circuit has a pattern and a practice and a regular custom of so treating it that might have lulled a party into filing something different or thinking as if there were a local rule that this would be treated differently, the state in its main brief cited as its principal support for the proposition that the Eighth Circuit has a regular practice the McDonnell Douglas case and said that that and other cases suggest this is how the Eighth Circuit treats all of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.914" offset="8414286">We responded in our brief by citing two published decisions that we found, and most of these rulings on en banc petitions, I believe, are unpublished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.841" offset="8458067">But we found two published decisions from 1985 where en banc petitions were denied and were labeled en banc petitions without any suggestion that they were treated or otherwise denominated as panel rehearing decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.860" offset="8510103">In its reply brief, the state has come back in footnote 2 and says, 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.490" offset="8576663">Well, there are two problems, we would submit, with this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.603" offset="8589097">First is that the McDonnell Douglas case on which they initially relied was a 1973 decision, and so we are surprised now to hear that the practice is allegedly more recent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.259" offset="8631729">But more fundamentally, we do not believe that this Court's jurisdiction can or should rest on what counsel may or may not be advised by unknown persons and unknown details.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.900" offset="8694214">There is nothing in the Eighth Circuit's rules or its internal operating procedures or any of its opinions that suggest that this is a standard practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.804" offset="8725874">We, frankly, do not know whether this is a practice that is more commonly used than not, or less commonly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.140" offset="8755236">We just don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.950" offset="8762446">And I believe that this Court should not have a policy of allowing jurisdiction by anecdote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.864" offset="8786165">I think the jurisdictional rules should be clearly written and should be interpreted and implemented in a way that the parties and the lower courts can know what they mean and can be governed accordingly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.960" offset="8934540">The best evidence of such a practice if a circuit court wishes to adopt it is to put it in the rules, which would allow the parties to know when their time was running and when it wasn't; and not only the parties filing the petition but, hopefully, the parties who might be opposing the petition would like to know when the case is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.670" offset="9001309">Now turning, if I may, to the... the merits of the argument here, the state's position comes down basically to the bald suggestion that in at least some cases the federal courts simply lack the power to ensure that constitutionally-required remedies are implemented and funded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.545" offset="9096813">We believe that that position is without any precedent in this Court's jurisprudence and is dangerously wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.840" offset="13957992">Just a couple of brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.383" offset="13964157">Returning momentarily to the jurisdictional question, the Respondents take the position I think, as I understand it now, that what this Court ought to do is review the particular papers that were filed in the Court of Appeals, rather than taking the Court of Appeal's order at face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.473" offset="14032597">We don't think that is in fact a rule that is likely to lead to a great deal of certainty and we think that the Court of Appeals is entitled to treat the papers before it as a rehearing petition if it wishes to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.831" offset="14082021">As we have pointed out several times, several circuits do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.614" offset="14093097">The difference between a case like this and--</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.824" offset="14109920">Well, I'm... you know, I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.966" offset="14114517">Where you want certainty is ex ante.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.188" offset="14127370">You want the person who files this petition to know whether the consideration of it is going to toll his time to appeal and to tell him that he's only going to know that when the Court comes out with its decision that says well, we've treated this as this, or we've treated it as the other, that doesn't help, does it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="3511.689" offset="14197378">--But Justice Scalia, there's no such absolute certainty in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.942" offset="14210439">I mean, because everybody agrees, I believe that the Court can treat it as a petition for rehearing if it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.485" offset="14232591">It could grant it as a petition for rehearing, it could modify its opinion, all sorts of things could go on, and I think to allow the Courts that sort of flexibility as part of their own operating procedures simply makes sense even though there might be some less certainty on the front end as to what the particular litigant expects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.126" offset="14299151">The difference between this and the Credit Company case I think is that a Court of Appeals can and should have the power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.580" offset="14324960">What a Court of Appeals can't do is, it can't treat June 15th as if it were June 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.384" offset="14344186">That's just something that's wholly outside the ambit of the power of a Court of Appeals and therefore that purely... that effort to convey jurisdiction by taking an action like that is literally outside its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.851" offset="14394028">The second point, briefly, on the question of the position below, just so it is understood, the state's position has always been opposed to a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.450" offset="14436450">The school district, despite what it is saying right now, has at various times throughout the litigation said that the school district should bear none of the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.044" offset="14470828">We have said we as a general principle are opposed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.686" offset="14481381">We think the school district should bear some of the cost, and we think that the Court should devise remedies that allows both of those principles to be carried out, where the state would bear a burden, the school district would bear a burden, and constitutional compliance would be achieved with both of them doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.775" offset="14537806">The problem, as we have said, is that the Court simply ignored those considerations in developing the particular remedy and essentially made the kind of order that it led to, or the alternative of the state bearing all of it, a foregone conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.674" offset="14593394">Finally, I'd just like to say... sorry?</text>
