            <text syncTime="17.962" offset="213885">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.829" offset="225379">This matter is here on a writ of certiorari issued to the New York State Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.948" offset="245859">And the issue raised is whether, within the constraints of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, a motorist, who causes the death of another person as a result of an automobile collision, may be subject to a prosecution for homicide and/or assault, even though, at the scene of the collision and prior to the death of the motorist he or she... prior to the death of the other person that motorist is charged with driving while intoxicated and failure to keep right, and then subsequent to the death, enters pleas of guilty to those vehicle and traffic violations, and is sentenced.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="472707">It first collided with an eastbound vehicle and struck the rearview mirror... or struck the sideview mirror of that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.610" offset="508442">It proceeded into the eastbound lane and struck a second vehicle in which Brenda Dirago was the operator and her husband, Daniel Dirago, was the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.716" offset="552955">Respondent Corbin and both Mr. and Mrs. Dirago were taken to the hospital, where at approximately 8:00, Respondent Corbin was arrested for driving while intoxicated and failure to keep right.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.673" offset="596736">He was issued traffic tickets for those offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.458" offset="611887">He then consented to having blood withdrawn, and blood was withdrawn for the purpose of chemical analysis at approximately 8:25 p.m.--</text>
            <text syncTime="127.433" offset="651802">The defendant was not arraigned that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.265" offset="659117">He was hospitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.818" offset="669357">The tickets which were issued to him, directed to... him to appear in the Town of LaGrange Court, a justice court, on October 29th, a Thursday night.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.609" offset="716481">However, the Court did not sit on Thursday nights, it sits on Tuesday night.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.946" offset="733827">So the Court sent a letter to the Respondent Corbin directing him to appear on an advanced return date, that date being October 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.035" offset="770189">No notice was given to the district attorney of the advanced return date.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.356" offset="791505">On the night that the defendant appeared, it was not a night scheduled for the district attorney to be in that courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.443" offset="823792">The defendant appeared with counsel, and entered pleas of guilty to both... both the misdemeanor of driving while intoxicated and the violation of failure to keep right.</text>

Roberts; the recessed lesson of Fugate v. New Mexico, addressing before this Court, the question of what the term "same offense" means.</text>

I keep on losing track of the numbers of these things... three of the counts of the indictment survive a Blockburger-based analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.240" offset="6722973">In this case if Blockburger is the law, if Blockburger is all that the Fifth Amendment requires, then this case goes back to New York State Court of Appeals on remand and the court of appeals will do that voodoo that they do so well on remand from this court and decide the question on state constitutional law grounds, and they may come to the same result, they may not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1881.044" offset="7666202">Their office proceeded in one direction, and that was to prepare the case for presentation to a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.484" offset="7707998">But incident to that... incident to that... they indicated quite early on, within two weeks after the fatality, that they were prepared to prosecute on the tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.826" offset="7761392">Defense counsel appeared before the LaGrange Town Court on a date set by the court, set by the court, and entered a plea of guilty to driving while intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.317" offset="7815309">The town justice, not wanting to enter or make any sentence on that date, adjourned the case to a night when the district attorney's office was scheduled to have one of its representatives present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.647" offset="7892632">One of its representatives, Assistant District Attorney Sauter, showed up on the night set by the court for sentencing, unarmed with any information about case except what she could find in the court file, and in the court file all that was there were these two tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.128" offset="7978522">Justice Caplicki imposed sentence, a $350 fine, suspension of license, driving school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.186" offset="8018751">And six weeks later... six weeks later... the district attorney's office, or more precisely, the grand jury in Dutchess County, returned the indictment that gave rise to the initiation of the proceedings in this case, where the counts in the indictment were challenged both on state law grounds and under the double jeopardy clause of the state and Federal constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.003" offset="8130032">The county court judge rejected the motion on the ground that somehow the defendant was guilty of procuring his own conviction, repelled division the second departments, Appellate Supreme Court of the State of New York, and proceeding in the nature of prohibition, dismissed, without any comment, and the case went to the New York State Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.349" offset="8215401">And then the New York State Court of Appeals, writing for a four-judge majority, Mr. Justice Titone held that although certain... the first... the manslaughter vehicular homicide or the vehicular assault charges in the indictment survived, a Blockburger-based analysis taking hold of the language in this Court's opinion in the Vitale case, the majority's observation that if the same evidence were to be used to support the prosecution on the homicide charges, there would be a substantial constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.826" offset="8381330">And seizing upon also, the language in the... excuse me... dissenting opinion, that to quibble with the characterization of the substantiality of the constitutional question, would rather simply be dispositive of the constitutional question held that Blockburger notwithstanding the prosecution in this case is barred under the double jeopardy clause as read by the court of appeals through its perception of the view of this Court as barring further prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.167" offset="8522705">And it is on that holding that we come to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.320" offset="8539319">It seems that of the protections of the Fifth Amendment this particular aspect... as I have mentioned... perhaps over-enthusiastically, and I apologize for that... this problem... this specific problem emerges in Vitale and has progressed through Thigpen where the Fifth Circuit in the Thigpen case in the decision below mounted the sort of analysis that we suggest ought be followed, that was followed by the New York State Court of Appeals, that was followed even more recently in a case we cite somewhat frequently in the brief, Connecticut decision of State v. Lonergan, to first parse the statutes themselves as written, the two statutes that are said to create the double jeopardy problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.555" offset="8760315">If the two statutes do not survive a Blockburger-based analysis there, the double jeopardy inquiry ends, and the double jeopardy clause precludes prosecution... a second prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.833" offset="8825412">The prosecutor, and I suspect, any prosecutor... certainly if I were a prosecutor... would look to have the inquiry end right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.737" offset="8849027">And if that's where the inquiry ends, then that's where the inquiry ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.538" offset="8860207">But it seems, from Vitale, and maybe perhaps by precursor language in the Brown case a few years before Vitale, that Blockburger is not the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.227" offset="8902943">Blockburger is an answer, an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.548" offset="8920289">The answer as to what the simple language, the simple, but as events since the adoption of the amendment indicates, complex problems presented by the double jeopardy clause lies in looking beyond the definitions, looking to the underlying idea, as this Court has said back in 1957 in the oft-quoted language of Green v. the United States, looking to the deeply ingrained idea that the state with all its power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.041" offset="9086219">Even earlier... I take that back... at approximately the same time that that statement was made by this Court in its opinion in Green v. the United States and a case decided a few years earlier, Brock v. North Carolina, writing at a time before the incorporation through the Fourteenth Amendment of the Fifth Amendment into the jurisprudence of the states, Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his concurring opinion said that in a due process analysis... in a due process analysis... fairness indicates that a prosecutor who has been incompetent or casual or even ineffective shouldn't be given an opportunity to see if he or she cannot do better a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.272" offset="9279107">It is the second time aspect that raises the question of whether there isn't even a third level beyond which the prosecution must pass before the prosecution is allowed the proceed to try the defendant again on a second charge where the factual matrix that gives rise to the second charge is sensibly indistinguishable from the first prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.433" offset="9551825">But doing better can also, and as it does mean very often the civil context of res judicata cases, trying to get a better result, to enhance the outcome of the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.728" offset="9620997">Trying to do better in the kind of callous calculus of the criminal law, a... oh, good heavens... a conviction for a, let's say, second-degree crime could be considered not doing as well from the prosecutor's point of view as getting a conviction for the higher, the first degree, of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.660" offset="9712739">And I think the language bears the fair construction that an attempt to do better is not only to try to convict the defendant who has once been acquitted, but to perhaps try to do better by convicting a defendant who's been once acquitted on a charge that arises out of the same operable set of facts, by convicting him over yet a higher degree of crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3064.448" offset="12399799">But there is, underlying this whole double jeopardy problem a consideration of the fairness to the defendant, who is facing the somewhat awesome power of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.581" offset="12700416">And the fairness that is inherent in the system is translated in this context into a... an adoption of principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel, borrowed quite clearly and liberally from the civil side into this specific problem presented by cases like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.777" offset="12877108">Mr. Farrell has discussed the issue with fairness to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.729" offset="12892991">In this case the defendant was on noticed by virtue of Section 1800(d) that he could be prosecuted for the assault and homicide in spite of his guilty pleas to the vehicle and traffic offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.405" offset="12951714">And this is a scheme which must be viewed as also fair to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.642" offset="12972612">In fact, here, prior to sentencing, the defendant knew that the prosecution intended to present this case to a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.581" offset="13008348">This is the defense counsel, who may well have been the only person in the room who knew about it, but he knew about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.287" offset="13043247">Mr. Farrell has also indicated that this case should be governed by New York State Criminal Procedure Law Section 170.20 which provides that the district attorney may stop any justice court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.911" offset="13097686">That is a general provision of the criminal procedure law of New York.</text>
