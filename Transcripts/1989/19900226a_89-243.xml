            <text syncTime="10.856" offset="180928">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.198" offset="238293">We are here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.769" offset="260549">This suit was filed in 1983 to stop Medtronic from infringement of two basic patents related to a medical device known as an automatic implantable defibrillator.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.327" offset="310809">Medtronic defended in part in the court below arguing that its infringing activities were exempt from the patent infringement laws based on a 1984 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.218" offset="358352">The question before this court is the interpretation of that statute, which is 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="64.656" offset="396177">That statute provides that it shall not be an act of infringement to manufacture, use or sell a patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law regulating drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.237" offset="474440">I submit that there is only one proper interpretation of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.356" offset="490949">It applies to drugs only, and has no application whatever to other nondrug products regulated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, namely, medical devices, color additives and food additives.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.199" offset="542358">The statute refers on its face only to drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.983" offset="557405">The statutory definition of drugs in the FDA Act excludes specifically devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.339" offset="586871">A century of FDA legislation has treated drugs differently from devices from 1906 until the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.779" offset="624592">Now, Medtronic argues that the phrase "Federal law regulating drugs"... and it takes that phrase out of context... Medtronic, the respondent, argues that the phrase "Federal law regulating drugs" equals and means the entire Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and even the nondrug products.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.810" offset="716752">The court, I suggest... well, the court of appeals did not analyze what the phrase Federal law regulating drugs meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.131" offset="746009">What the court did was go to one piece of the legislative history dealing with their analysis of what the Roche Bolar decision had done and look at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.320" offset="782789">And, in fact, the court decision when it goes to the words of the statute simply leads off by saying we conclude that this statute covers any patented invention so long as it's for the limited purposes enumerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.164" offset="838169">But it never discusses how... what the meaning of the remaining phrase is and how does that fit into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.584" offset="867844">And I suggest one of the errors of the court of appeals' opinion which Medtronic has failed to support is that it doesn't deal with the specific language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.805" offset="2728703">The House report, in fact, specifically states that the only activity exempted is drug testing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.876" offset="2760990">In Medtronic's only quote from the legislative history, in their only quote, they omit the very phrases in the legislative history that specifically say the purpose is to exempt drug testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.552" offset="2811772">I suggest Congress meant what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.069" offset="2821803">Section 271(e)(1) is a narrow exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.938" offset="2833297">It's a drug-only statute, and it does not apply to infringing medical devices such as Medtronic's product in suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.229" offset="2870391">The... the focus on the language which I've talked about, development and submission, we've talked about it applying to different sections of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.517" offset="2915531">I think it would be difficult for Congress to have selected a less appropriate word than drugs if it intended to include devices in light of the fact that the statute already defines drugs as excluding devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.296" offset="2982718">And it's unreasonable, I suggest, that Congress later in different reference to Federal law regulating drugs was intended to include the entire Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act referred to just a few lines above.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.723" offset="3036425">In addition, other statutes also confirm and support that 271(e)(1) is a drug-only statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.126" offset="3069967">For example, (e)(1) exempts drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.161" offset="3082192">Section (e)(2) applies certain patent owner protections with respect to that exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.934" offset="3109255">In 1984 when Congress placed human drugs in the exemption of (e)(1), they also placed human drugs in the patent order protections of (e)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="753.556" offset="3151782">In 1988 when the laws were amended, Congress added animal drugs and veterinary biological products to the exemption of (e)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="761.812" offset="3184801">They also added them to the exemption to the patent owner protection of (e)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="766.550" offset="3203714">Indeed, the proposed Senate bill which sought to add medical devices to Section 271(e)(1) also added them to the patent owner protections of (e)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="777.857" offset="3248958">I suggest it's indisputable, even by Medtronic, medical devices are not in Section (e)(2), and the reason is simple: Because Congress never put them in Section (e)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="790.681" offset="3300262">In addition, the relationship of the patent extension law, Section 156, and the words of that statute to the words of (e)(1) are also relevant and also confirm that (e)(1), 271(e)(1), is a drug-only statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.175" offset="3362225">The words of 156, the patent extension, use the specific products: drugs, medical devices, food additives and color additives.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.315" offset="3402767">In sharp contrast, 271(e)(1) refers only to drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.434" offset="3423247">And this disparate inclusion and exclusion of these two statutes enacted at the same time in 1984 also confirms that 271(e)(1) is a drug-only statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.860" offset="3472984">And it's no wonder that Section 271(e)(1) is limited to drugs whereas Section 156 is a multi-product statute for extensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.233" offset="3518437">Section 156, the patent extension law, was in Congress or similar bills were before Congress for years and years before Section 271(e)(1) had ever been thought of.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.742" offset="3568487">In 1980-81 there were extension bills that applied the extension in order to further patent rights to multiproduct applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.748" offset="3608507">The quid pro quo for 156 as it was... as it was shepherded through the House was not (e)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="877.621" offset="3648004">It was the speedy new procedures for generic drugs, which we call ANDA or abbreviated new drug applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.293" offset="3682695">And that was the tradeoff that Congress entered into, and that tradeoff had been effected in 19... late '83 or early '84.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.832" offset="3716863">And then along came the Roche Bolar decision of the Federal circuit which said specifically that generic... that the use of a generic drug for a bioequivalency test in order to get approval was a patent infringement.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.418" offset="3827204">And it was with that thought in mind that Section (e)(1) came into effect in order to further the abbreviated new drug applications, again confirming it's a drug--</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.561" offset="7599808">The reason it does make sense is what Congress was trying to legislate here was the intersection between patent law and drug regulation and device regulation and additive regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.945" offset="7705343">Discontinuities had grown up, time alterations had grown up since the beginning of the regulation of these devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.336" offset="7750901">The mandatory testing requirements of the FDA caused a long period of time to expire during the patent of a drug, a device or an additive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.929" offset="7809206">Congress was trying to correct that situation and simultaneously correct the situation at the back end of the patent, which required the next comer to the marketplace to engage in its own FDA-mandated testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.759" offset="7892589">So, you had a foreshortening of the patent at the front because of FDA-mandated testing, you had an elongation at the back because of FDA testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.567" offset="7939818">So the words "patented invention" are designed to embrace all of the patented items that are impacted by FDA-mandated testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.695" offset="8016305">A Federal law which regulates drugs is a Federal law which regulates drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.884" offset="8053085">The FDCA, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, is plainly a Federal law which regulates drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.176" offset="8214208">Now, Lilly argues on the basis of a statute that Congress did not write.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.166" offset="8258198">Lilly's argument requires the transformation of one or more words.</text>

            <text syncTime="2088.235" offset="8490479">One of Lilly's responses is that that last word at the end of the sentence, "drugs", modifies patented invention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.269" offset="11286626">The '84 statute was a very important statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.256" offset="11306584">If you look at the legislative history it was designed to achieve three objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.528" offset="11339603">One, the drug companies who were before Congress at that time were claiming loss of patent because of the elongated testing required by the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.686" offset="11388295">So, Congress wanted to stimulate innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.824" offset="11408775">Congress also made it clear it wanted to promote competition in the medical field on expiration of the patent, and Congress also made it clear that it wanted to restore some definiteness about patent expiration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.968" offset="11489336">The problem with the testing was you never knew when it would end, and if you couldn't... if you couldn't start, you were just left in limbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.109" offset="11529983">What Congress did in '84 was say okay, all of you medical people, all of you drug people, all of you device people, all of you additive people, you're going to get an extension, and an elaborate scheme was established in 156 to give them the extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.757" offset="11616501">Then Congress said, but that's it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.660" offset="11636145">Congress quite clearly said there shall be no other direct or indirect extension of patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.599" offset="11675955">That's what 271 was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.884" offset="11689016">Congress said you people... and it named them all in 156... you get an extension, but you competitors, you can test during the patent period so that when this extended patent ends, you're prepared to compete, to enter the marketplace to bring these health products to test--</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.084" offset="13017813">The FDA has in its regulations made a policy decision that device manufacturers can charge because of the cost of the devices, the cost of the devices; that if device manufacturers could not recoup a little of their investment, small device companies simply could not test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.383" offset="13115093">They simply could not afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.152" offset="13122094">The truth of the matter is that although $17,000 per device sounds like a lot of money, it is a small fraction first of the research development and manufacturing costs of Medtronics.</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.421" offset="13239227">They are not charged in part because some of them go into animals, and it's hard to make Fido pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.193" offset="13274336">Some of them are used for ladder tests, which are just dropping tests, and some of them simply are not collected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.306" offset="14490701">The term drugs embraces like glove the term devices... the term drugs embraces the term devices like a glove only with a crowbar and a hammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.597" offset="14535945">The statute specifically defines drugs as excluding devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.085" offset="14553813">We've heard that the theme of Congress, the theme of this was 156 tradeoff versus medical device technology coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.839" offset="14588817">Congress didn't use the term medical device technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.226" offset="14602401">Congress 13 separate times used the term drugs or drug bioequivalency testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.129" offset="14629986">So I suggest that what we've heard about the theme of Congress in the tradeoff is totally incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.616" offset="14656004">With respect to the use of the term patented invention, if Congress used the term drug patent, then... then processes or methods regarding drugs might not have been included as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.674" offset="14704174">So it was easier to use the very terms they did,</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.976" offset="14717444">"development and submission under a Federal law regulating manufacture, use or sale of drugs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.530" offset="14739596">to be drug specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.649" offset="14748060">Only... only in our wildest dreams would Congress have used a... one term which defined as excluding another for the purpose of including the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.889" offset="14801036">Now, regarding the (e)(1) and (e)(2) dichotomy, there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.360" offset="14818904">First, if drugs... if devices aren't in (e)(2), then a medical device company can come in and get approval two years before the patent expires, knowing that preliminary injunctions are rarely granted and no suit can be filed during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.620" offset="14880030">The suit's filed with two years left to run natural delays occur like the ones Medtronic caused in this lawsuit, and what we wind up with is no effective protection, no injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.011" offset="14921513">That's what (e)(2) is there for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.611" offset="14927991">It was to stop people from going and getting approval ahead of time in an improper way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.665" offset="14952128">And it would be a bizarre and unfair concoction to have medical devices construed into (e)(1) where it's not there and also not be in Section (e)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.056" offset="14997686">For all the reasons I've explained earlier, I think it's most urgent that we request that Medtronic's delay be stopped and that if this decision is reversed--</text>
