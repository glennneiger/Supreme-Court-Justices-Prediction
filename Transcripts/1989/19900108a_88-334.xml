            <text syncTime="10.438" offset="169014">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.530" offset="181344">Petitioner John Lytle filed a complaint in Federal district court alleging that he had been fired for racially discriminatory reasons and that the Respondent employer had subsequently retaliated against him for racially discriminatory reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.830" offset="238605">Petitioner sued under both 1981 and Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.804" offset="254487">His complaint therefore alleged both legal and equitable claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.997" offset="271310">He made a timely demand for a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.578" offset="281550">Notwithstanding the presence of those legal claims, the district court dismissed the Section 1981 claims on reasons that everyone concedes were erroneous and proceeded to trial on the equitable claims, ruling against Petitioner and in favor of Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.820" offset="342572">Respond... Petitioner subsequently attempted to correct that error in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.673" offset="369948">While the court of appeals held that it was error to dismiss the 1981 claims, it found that it was powerless to reverse and remand, for it held that the judge's findings, if not clearly erroneous, could collaterally estop Petitioner from litigating his claims before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.754" offset="442255">Thus, the import of the holding of the court of appeals is that because the district court proceeded to make findings, his original error in denying a jury trial was unreviewable, meaning therefore that orders denying the jury trial are not reviewable after trial.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="96.496" offset="513204">Ms. Reed, these were findings in connection, of the sort that are ordinarily made in connection with a bench trial, findings of fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="104.614" offset="545700">There were findings of fact on whether Title VII had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.604" offset="557716">The issue in this case, then, is at what point a party is entitled to appeal an improper denial of a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.801" offset="594497">Under the view of the respondent, and apparently in the view of the Fourth Circuit, Petitioner lost his right to appeal that order denying a jury trial on the first day of trial when that demand was extinguished and the bench trial begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.940" offset="651026">Such a holding has serious consequences for both litigants and the Federal courts, for if a party is in danger of losing his right to a jury trial, he must proceed by mandamus or take an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.788" offset="714451">Such an order would now fall within the confines of the Cohen doctrine, addressed by this Court in Lauro Lines v. Chasser and Midland Asphalt.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.186" offset="756038">The practice of this Court for well over 100 years, as we discuss in our brief, and that of all other circuits, has been to reverse and remand upon a finding that the denial of the jury trial right was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.835" offset="810582">What the Fourth Circuit has done, in effect, is to create a new category of interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.750" offset="838272">Until now, one would have thought, one had a right to appeal that denial at the conclusion of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.425" offset="868992">Indeed, if Petitioner had taken an interlocutory appeal, under its prevailing view, it is likely that such an appeal would have been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.039" offset="903473">Certainly Petitioner could have proceeded by mandamus, but--</text>

            <text syncTime="217.076" offset="995529">I... we believe that under the prevailing view of the law, had he attempted to take an interlocutory appeal, that appeal would probably have been dismissed because it was thought the jury trial orders were not appealable until the conclusion of the trial.</text>

            <label>Ms. Judith Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="233.546" offset="1061462">Now, Petitioner certainly could have proceeded by mandamus, but he was not required to do so at peril of forfeiting his right to ever appeal the denial of the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.573" offset="1105556">That has simply never been the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.696" offset="1114020">Now, the court of appeals did this under an erroneous view of collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.830" offset="1138575">Now, collateral estoppel is not like law of the case, which is used to maintain consistency during the proceedings of a single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.875" offset="1170758">Collateral estoppel is not applicable in the course of a single proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.258" offset="1192283">It is certainly not applicable on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.460" offset="1205135">The Fourth Circuit's use of collateral estoppel on direct appeal to preclude review of an obviously erroneous order is simply unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.706" offset="1242125">Now, collateral, by its terms, would appear to mean a separate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.872" offset="1262709">What the court of appeals seems to have done is some sort of new kind of estoppel that one might appropriately term bootstrap estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.647" offset="1297818">Petitioners cannot correct the denial of the jury trial, according to Respondent, because the district court made not one error but two errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.085" offset="1343584">It is a somewhat circular argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.997" offset="1355287">It ends up meaning that two wrongs may make a right, that because the district court proceeded to make findings after his error, Petitioner cannot get review of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.105" offset="1403666">Now the consequence of this ruling is that a party must seek and be granted interlocutory review of all rulings that might possibly infringe on a right to the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.276" offset="1460404">Now that is contrary to the Federal system as we know it, and it would be highly disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.560" offset="1481511">It raises the specter of trials being ended before they start, of counsel being required to simply walk out of the court room.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.158" offset="1515888">And indeed such a rule would not foster the values of repose that collateral estoppel is designed to foster.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.194" offset="1543996">It would, to the contrary, generate additional litigation, generate additional appeals, because it would force counsel to take protective appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.551" offset="1585478">Now, Respondents secondly argue that because the court would have directed a verdict for Respondent, a remand in this case is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.519" offset="1633334">Now, our first response to that is that is not what the court of appeals held in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.353" offset="1656636">The court of appeals did not hold that no reasonable jury would ever hold for Petitioner, or could ever hold for Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.391" offset="1688819">The court of appeals simply viewed the findings under a sufficiency of the evidence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.494" offset="1713269">Second, the record shows that there was considerable evidence on the... on both the issues that Petitioner raised to submit this case to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.540" offset="1757468">And if the district court could have found for either party there can't be a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.955" offset="1783068">Now, in our briefs we cite several examples from the record showing why in this record there was sufficient evidence to submit the case to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.122" offset="1815774">The court could grant a directed verdict only when no reasonable fact finder could have decided for Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.396" offset="1844822">In the instant case the court decided the issues under Rule 41(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="435.039" offset="1867392">And under that rule the judge could indeed do what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.012" offset="1879303">The judge could make rulings on disputed testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.675" offset="1898007">The judge was free to make inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.925" offset="1906993">The judge was free to decide whom he believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.988" offset="1919219">But not so under Rule 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.431" offset="1933011">In accordance with this Court's decision in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, the judge was required to allow the jury in this case, had one been empaneled, to weigh the evidence, make inferences and come to a conclusion as to whether or not Petitioner had been discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.812" offset="2002497">And we think that the trial judge indicated that by his own words in the trial transcript, as we point out in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.639" offset="2033844">When Petitioner's counsel recited a view of the evidence that could support Mr. Lytle's claim, the district court responded that that was indeed a reasonable view of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.366" offset="2080760">That single statement, especially coupled with the earlier denial of a summary judgment motion, puts to rest any claim that a directed verdict could have been granted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.675" offset="2129974">What was okay under Rule 41(b) for the judge to do, we contend, was... the judge was precluded from doing under Rule 50(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="510.379" offset="2168740">Accordingly, this Court should reverse the decision of the court of appeals and remand for a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.644" offset="2189847">You... in... indeed, the practical case, the practical issue in this case is when a party is supposed to appeal the wrongful denial of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.462" offset="2233106">Now, our position--</text>

            <text syncTime="528.052" offset="2239480">Well, in this... in this case the judge didn't rule on the... on the question of the right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.817" offset="2266543">His ruling, that you claim was error, was that there was no cause of action at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.592" offset="2297681">He didn't rule that there was not a jury trial if there had been a cause of action presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.485" offset="2313250">So this is not really a case in which we must be concerned that the jury trial right will be stifled because judges will erroneously rule that a jury is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.065" offset="2371555">This is just... there is, the fortuity here is an erroneous ruling of law by assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.618" offset="2397782">And I don't see how that is much different than having a previous hearing by the SEC.</text>

            <text syncTime="1384.942" offset="5667059">But I don't think the promotion issue has really been preserved up the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.168" offset="5695898">In Patterson the Court really considered the question of the overlap coverage between Section 1981 and Title VII and concluded that there could be a rational, common sense interpretation of the language of Section 1981 to make and enforce contracts that would yield an interpretation that wouldn't frustrate the congressional objective to the preference of conciliation over litigation in Title VII cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.501" offset="5837272">And with the... they looked at the... the court looked at the terminology to make and enforce contracts, and to make a contract extends only to the formation of a contract, and not to subsequent conduct, like the... even if it amounts to the breach of a contract or the imposition of discriminatory working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.668" offset="5933925">The right to enforce contracts, on the other hand, would extend to the legal process and protection of the legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.343" offset="5968616">So our position on the Patterson case would be that we would urge the Court to apply Patterson in this case to uphold the dismissal of both the retaliation and the discharge claims, because this is post-formation conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.664" offset="6045939">The discharge is obviously post-formation conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.487" offset="6057223">It actually involves the discriminatory application of rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.572" offset="7685592">It was a situation where the legal claims were dismissed and they were... there were pending equitable claims remaining that, under Title VII, that required the court to proceed with a bench trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.171" offset="7735956">In the separate suit type argument, too, another point to make would be that Parklane specifically recognized that the major premise with Beacon Theatres is that... is a rule that unless legal claims are tried first, prior to equitable claims, then the judge's factual findings on the equitable claims would collaterally estop the jury's redetermination of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.805" offset="7874510">And the two quotes that we would like to point out, or two portions of the opinion in Parklane that establish that... this premise is established by the following language that is in Parklane at page 334.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.835" offset="7938562">Recognition that an equitable determination could have collateral estoppel effect in a subsequent legal action was the major premise of this Court's decision in Beacon Theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.762" offset="7986314">And then quoting the Court's earlier decision in Katchen v. Landy, both Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that there may be situations in which the court could proceed to resolve the equitable claims first, even though... even though the results may be dispositive of the issues involved in the legal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.377" offset="8072727">So certainly Parklane and Katchen establish that Beacon Theatres rule that normally equitable or legal claims should be tried first as a general prudential rule, and that an equitable determination can have collateral estoppel effect in subsequent legal proceeding--</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.614" offset="8909690">To conclude on Parklane, our position would be that in Parklane the court found that the defendants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims in the prior lawsuit, and that they were therefore collaterally estopped from relitigating factual issues in a second lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.768" offset="8986386">The court found that this application of collateral estoppel did not violate the Seventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.018" offset="9039362">From the standpoint of looking at the principles of judicial economy, the same principles that applied in Parklane apply here, the dual purpose of protecting litigants from relitigating an identical issue and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.301" offset="9120446">To summarize our final argument, it's clear that the Court need not address the collateral estoppel issue if a directed verdict would have been proper, since the dismissal of the 1981 claim in that situation would have constituted harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.871" offset="9194739">We realize that the standards are different for a Rule 41(b) motion and that there is some weighing of the evidence that is allowed there, but the standard for directed verdict would include a situation where there is an absence of proof on an issue material to the cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.229" offset="10180182">--Well, I think what the court did constitutes a violation of the Seventh Amendment, don't get me wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.905" offset="10210902">However, the issue of when a party gets to appeal a wrongful denial does not turn on whether the, the jury trial right stems from the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.433" offset="10256982">So the... I don't think you... the necessity for avoidance of a constitutional... deciding on a constitutional issue is really implicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.539" offset="10293449">Now, there are... Respondents state that they argued below the same thing that they raise here, that is that retaliation is not covered under 1981, for the grounds that are set forth in Patterson perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.449" offset="10361054">The argument they made below was a very different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.084" offset="10379653">Now, we don't deny that they can get to raise the Patterson questions on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.279" offset="10400342">We think that would be entirely appropriate and that that is what should occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.392" offset="10412881">This record is not in the condition for this Court to resolve the Patterson question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.995" offset="10439212">What Patterson means is that there are fact-specific issues that would be appropriately redressed, addressed on remand, including retroactivity and including whether discharge and retaliation are within the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.864" offset="10486755">As Justice White pointed out, if we had by-passed Title VII and sued only under Section 1981, Respondent would concede that the denial of a jury trial would have been reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.082" offset="10543597">We don't think the Court should adopt a collateral estoppel rule that encourages or perhaps even requires a by-passing of Title VII remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.950" offset="10587065">Finally, Respondents urge that no remand is necessary because of the directed verdict possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.335" offset="10628652">Now, certainly on remand, whether a directed verdict is appropriate can also be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.440" offset="10657073">In closing, I would like to state that indeed the Patterson issues are relevant now and they may be raised by both parties on remand, and we would urge that this Court reverse the Fourth Circuit's ruling and remand this case.</text>
