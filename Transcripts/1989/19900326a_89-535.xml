            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="233910">Under that provision, the first $50 per month of child support is disregarded or not counted in AFDC eligibility and assistance determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.654" offset="278004">The issue in this case is whether, as the Secretary of Health and Human Services has determined, the term child support payments refers to payments from absent parents, and does not include Social Security child's insurance benefits, or whether, as Respondents contend and as the court of appeals concluded, the term means not only payments from absent parents, but also Social Security child's insurance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.853" offset="370791">We believe that the Secretary's interpretation should be upheld for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="388659">First, the term child support is used repeatedly in the Social Security Act to refer to payments from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.577" offset="417707">Indeed, the current version of the disregard, as it was amended in 1988, explicitly refers to payments by the absent parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.083" offset="451771">Second, the legislative history and background of the AFDC program reveal a consistent emphasis on the problem of obtaining payments from absent parents and the only prior instance of a child support disregard as part of that emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.878" offset="518958">It is reasonable to view this disregard in light of that long standing emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.430" offset="537139">Third, to the extent that the statute is ambiguous, the Secretary's interpretation is entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.667" offset="562112">Now, a few words of background.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.958" offset="607252">You say child support is a term of art, or--</text>

            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="120.827" offset="622716">It... it is a term of art within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.231" offset="636300">If you look at Title IV of the Social Security Act, and the AFDC program is IV-A of the Social Security Act, there is an entire part of the Social Security Act, Title IV-D, that is addressed to child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.622" offset="685933">And throughout both Title IV-A, which has a close relationship to Title IV-D, and Title IV-D, child support refers to payments from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.227" offset="720310">Now, the linchpin of the relationship between Title IV-A and Title IV-D is the requirement that has been in the AFDC program since 1975, that an AFDC recipient assign rights to child support to the state, and the state then collects them.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.087" offset="783735">The entire IV-D system, as it relates to the four... as it relates to AFDC recipients, hinges on that assignment of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.693" offset="818217">And so it is reasonable to view the term child support payments, even though it says any child support payments, in view of its repeated meaning throughout the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.949" offset="855206">That... it's important to understand why this assignment of rights developed in 1975, and why the Title IV-D program, insofar as it applies to AFDC recipients, was developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.189" offset="900137">And that is because repeatedly Congress has identified the problem of obtaining payments from absent parents as one of the chief reasons that people are on AFDC, and that problem is one of the chief obstacles to getting people off of AFDC and on the road to self-sufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.099" offset="963771">And it... it's a very particular defined problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.635" offset="973907">And Congress has tried a number of different ways, it has been a frustrating problem to get at that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.305" offset="1000656">And that is why child support is in Title IV to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.459" offset="1021240">And so... and in no other context in Title IV of the Social Security Act is it applied to Social Security benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.584" offset="1169720">And I would suggest that the place to look for that is the meaning that it has elsewhere in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.888" offset="1190932">Now, it's not an unusual phenomenon for two words to have a different meaning if you separate them than they have together.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.958" offset="1219249">Child support: does it support children?</text>
            <text syncTime="271.827" offset="1226667">Yes, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.660" offset="1230011">But there was a recent decision in the D.C. Circuit of Judge Ginsberg addressing the Freedom of Information Act that talked about this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.997" offset="1259373">And in that opinion Judge Ginsberg discussed the fact that the term parking ticket, for example, has a particular meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.753" offset="1286435">But if you separate it as a ticket for parking it could mean the ticket that you get to go into a garage that allows you to park your car there.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.491" offset="1313394">And it's a similar situation here, that the term child support has a particular meaning in the statute, that to just ask well, does this support children does damage to that meaning that it has in the other provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.289" offset="1404509">There is a disregard in certain limited circumstances, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.408" offset="1424989">And let me back up and explain the Secretary's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.343" offset="1436796">Within weeks of the amendments that passed this disregard initially in 1984, the Secretary determined that they should apply to payments from absent parents, and enumerated the payments that go to the state that are also passed through to the family, also direct support payments which still go to the family and voluntary support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.690" offset="1514119">Subsequently, the Secretary has determined that in addition to those categories of payments from absent parents, spousal support payments in limited circumstances get the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.362" offset="1548809">And those circumstances are basically when the spousal support payments are from an absent parent and are linked to child support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.301" offset="1584649">Three conditions have to be met for those spousal support payments to be collected and to get the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.805" offset="1606592">First, there has to have been established support obligations from the absent parent to both the spouse and the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.943" offset="1635222">Second, the spouse and the child have to be living in the same house.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.578" offset="1649747">And third, the state has to be collecting the spouse's support along with the child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.715" offset="1666256">Now, in the Secretary's determination that those spousal support payments were entitled to the disregard, he cited Section 12 of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.606" offset="1709828">That was the provision that said that the states should collect spousal support payments in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.974" offset="1731249">And the legislative history of that provision is clear that the reason for that is because in those limited circumstances the spousal support can be seen as having a child support purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.445" offset="1857159">Those spousal support payments are coming from the absent parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.564" offset="1869698">The absent parent has repeatedly been identified in the AFDC program as the reason people are on AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.651" offset="1898014">There is no similar history with Title II benefits, and it comes as part of a sustained congressional effort to get that absent parent to fulfil his obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.280" offset="1968545">What they do is they expressly include payments from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.667" offset="1982024">Now, Title II benefits would be included as unearned income, and there would be no authority to exclude... to give them the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.738" offset="2014311">So, by the fact that the Secretary carefully limited the payments that were entitled to the disregard and didn't suggest that any other payments might be entitled to them, they are excluded from the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.295" offset="2056630">And in some ways it is not surprising that the Secretary didn't, because in no other context has Social Security benefits ever been treated as child support, in the Secretary's administration of the AFDC program, of the child support program under Title IV-D and of the Title II child's insurance benefits programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.090" offset="2131758">The Secretary is the official who has been charged by Congress with implementing all three of those programs, and this issue of treating Title II benefits as child support had simply not come up, because it was so different from the way that child support is treated in other provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.434" offset="2489113">And in Title IV, in the AFDC program since 1975, it has been a requirement for the state's participation in the AFDC program that the state administer a child support program in conformity with the directions of, at that time, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and now the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.363" offset="2580855">And it has never been part of the state's obligation, under that child support program, to include Title II benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.636" offset="2617949">They are not treated as that under the state's program.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.321" offset="2624636">And if you look at Title IV-D, under Section 651, for example, where it talks about the purposes of the section for which Federal funds are authorized, it refers to obtaining child support, and it refers to payments from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.430" offset="2689107">And similarly in Section 652, which talks about the requirements of state plans, it talks about child support and it talks about obtaining payments from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.286" offset="2724529">And in Section 658, which provides Federal incentive payments to the states based on the effectiveness of their child support program, it has never been the case that a state would receive incentives based on the payment of these Title II benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.482" offset="2793283">Instead, the state receives it on payments collected under the plan, under the child support plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.254" offset="2820450">Now, Congress clearly knew the difference between Title II benefits and child support payments when it passed this disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.257" offset="2852424">In the legislative history when the family income requirement was proposed by the Senate, and that requirement required including siblings of an AFDC child in the household for the first time in the AFDC unit, the Senate report explicitly refers to Social Security or child support as the types, as among the types of income that would now be included that had been excluded in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.892" offset="2959004">And in the family income requirement itself, it talks about benefits provided under Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.146" offset="2983977">In contrast, in the disregard provision the language explicitly refers to child support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.318" offset="3008636">And so Congress clearly was drawing a distinction between the two, at least in its... at least in its usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.572" offset="3041655">I would also suggest that the 1988 amendment is particularly helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.709" offset="3058269">The judgment here is prospective, and so the 1988 amendment is directly relevant to the judgment under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.796" offset="3090556">In the 1988 amendment, first, the text of the provision explicitly refers to payments by the absent parent, and contains no indication that it is intended to refer to child support payments of any other kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.438" offset="3137159">Now, the 1988 amendment is helpful not only in terms of the text of the provision, but it is also helpful in terms of the purpose of the provision, because there has been a discussion as to whether the purpose of the provision, of the disregard provision, should be viewed as having the same incentive purpose of obtaining payments from absent parents and trying to get families off of AFDC, or whether it should be viewed as having a purpose, either solely or principally, of mitigating the hardship of the family income requirement and the inclusion of siblings who had previously been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.463" offset="3285221">Now what the amendment does in 1988 is it says that a payment will only get a disregard if it is paid when it is due by the absent parent, if it is paid in a timely fashion by the absent parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.536" offset="3333495">Now that, the operation of that, the credit only to timely payments, doesn't make sense if the purpose of the provision is to mitigate the hardship of the family income requirement, because if the sibling had been excluded before the family income requirement and the payments came late, that sibling would still get the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.767" offset="3414475">But if the purpose is to add incentives to try to get the absent parent in the position of making regular, timely payments, then the timeliness requirement makes perfect sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.453" offset="3533175">Now, there has been a suggestion that it is unfair to exclude Title II benefits when these other child support payments are getting the payment... are getting the disregard.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.431" offset="3609139">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.964" offset="3611229">And when these, now the emphasis is on II child's insurance benefits are somehow arbitrarily being excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.726" offset="3682282">It is a relatively small percentage of people on AFDC who get any disregard, and the disregard does mitigate hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.565" offset="3709658">It is very important to these needy families.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.431" offset="3717077">But the great majority of families on AFDC don't get a disregard, and they don't have any hope of developing a stream of outside income at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.706" offset="3754275">I mean, the question really is do people who are getting the Title II benefits, do they get the disregard that goes to people when their parents make a payment, when their absent parents make a payment, or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.564" offset="3809655">And in that situation they are much more like the great majority of people who are on AFDC who do not get the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.588" offset="3853750">Now, there is another point which Respondents have raised which is that the plain meaning of the term... of the statute is inconsistent with the view that the payments only refer to payments from absent parents, because the statute refers to any child support payments, including those passed-through by the state under the pass-through provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.818" offset="3934625">And Respondents contend that if the provision only refers to payments from absent parents, then it is only referring to those passed-through by the state under the pass-through provision, and it is not giving any meaning to the "any child support payment" part of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.614" offset="4001812">And that simply isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.146" offset="4007977">As early as 1981 the Secretary of Health and Human Services informed Congress that there was a kind of payment known as direct support payments that were going directly to the family, despite the assignment of child support rights to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.789" offset="4070566">And the Secretary has issued three regulations to deal with the treatment of those direct payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.562" offset="4097629">And those are payments that are not passed-through by the state under the pass-through provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.864" offset="4118840">So it is perfectly consistent with the plain meaning to interpret child support payments as referring to payments from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.072" offset="4155725">It refers to any child support payments, including those passed-through by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.392" offset="4181012">Now, as we discussed, the Secretary within weeks of the DEFRA amendment determined that payments from absent parents of various kinds were entitled to the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.582" offset="4225733">And the Secretary at that time noted that payments that were passed-through, direct payments, and voluntary payments were entitled to the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.388" offset="4264917">Now, Respondents have raised a number of objections to that interpretation as being unreasonable, because if the statute is susceptible to more than one reading, then the Secretary's interpretation should prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.797" offset="4318625">One of the objections that Respondents have raised is to the spousal... the inclusion of spousal support payments, the point that Justice O'Connor raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.403" offset="4349031">We have discussed that the Secretary applied it to those in the limited circumstances in which they served a child support purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.390" offset="4376930">Respondents have also objected to the inclusion of voluntary support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.111" offset="4391872">It is important to distinguish between voluntary support payments and direct support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.312" offset="4408695">Voluntary support payments are those payments that are made in the absence of a legal order to do so by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.168" offset="4440042">They can either be made directly to the family and be a direct payment, or they can be made to the state and be a part of the payment that goes through the state system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.274" offset="4484450">Now, it is perfectly reasonable for the Secretary to apply the disregard to voluntary payments, because those payments are from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.063" offset="4515693">So there is nothing inconsistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.248" offset="4524365">It is consistent with the Secretary's interpretation, and it is also consistent with the Secretary's general interpretation that the term child support in this provision should be construed first in light of the meaning that it is given in other provisions of Title IV-A and Title IV-D, which he is charged with administering, and second that it should be interpreted in light of the long-standing emphasis in the AFDC program and the problem of obtaining payments from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.601" offset="4641812">Now, there was one prior instance of a child support disregard, and that was in 1975 amendments as part of Congress' overhaul of the AFDC system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.890" offset="4686951">Congress did a number of very significant things in 1975 with respect to child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.111" offset="4707849">First, the requirements that we discussed earlier that an AFDC recipient assign rights to child support to the state was passed in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.649" offset="4742018">Second, the requirement that a state which participates in the AFDC program have a child support program was passed in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.405" offset="4773051">And the entire creation of the child support system under Title IV-D was passed in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.142" offset="4795934">And as one aspect of that systematic attempt to get at this problem of payments from absent parents, Congress passed for a 15-month period a child support pass-through and disregard provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.950" offset="4847239">Under that provision, the first 40 percent of the first $50 per month of support payments collected from the absent parent were passed through to the family on whose behalf they were collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.007" offset="4895409">The legislative history of that provision makes clear that the purpose of that pass-through and disregard was an incentive purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.780" offset="4926547">It was an incentive for the non, for the custodial parent to cooperate in obtaining child support payments from the absent parent, and it was an incentive also to ensure that the family would always be better off if the absent parent made a payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.575" offset="5001675">The Secretary, in interpreting the disregard, has specifically referred to this prior example of the disregard, and just as it was reasonable for the Secretary to interpret the language and the emphasis in terms of the general long-standing emphasis, it was also reasonable for the Secretary to interpret this specific device in light of the history of the only prior example as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.374" offset="5100940">Once again, I would just point out that the Secretary is the official charged by Congress with administering the Title IV-A AFDC program, the Title IV-D child support program, and the Title II child's insurance benefits program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.152" offset="5164052">His interpretation that child support payments mean payments from absent parents, not Social Security benefits, is reasonable and is consistent with the statute, and should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="2525.725" offset="10242256">To the extent that you rely on the legislative compromise and the legislative history in 1984, wouldn't the purpose of mitigating the hardship of the, of including the income of the sibling and making him join the family group also apply to people who are receiving money from a grandparent or people... children... or even children who are working at some job where they earn a few dollars a week, or something like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.490" offset="10341312">Yes, Your Honor, and we can only speculate as to why Congress chose to apply the disregard to child support payments rather than to simply any income of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.714" offset="10382272">Again, the legislative history does show that there were two specific kinds of payments that Congress was most concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.070" offset="10419680">Also, it would have been an administrative nightmare, I believe, if Department of Health and Human Services had been required to figure out which families had previously excluded children from the ADC assistance unit, and were therefore affected by sibling deeming and should receive the benefits of the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.865" offset="10490837">Many families excluded children and then added them back, and then excluded them again, depending upon who had income coming in at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.971" offset="10531275">It was just a lot easier to apply a blanket disregard to any child support payments, which would encompass the two groups that Congress was most concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.064" offset="10591670">Now, again, the Secretary, in his 1987 brief in the Gilliard case, offered as the reason for the disregard's enactment one reason: mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.722" offset="10638272">And it is only after a challenge to that came up that he began talking about incentives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.977" offset="10671291">Also, the Secretary refers to other references to the term child support in other sections of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.666" offset="10702115">In each case he takes that term out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.552" offset="10721655">Many times the reference is neutral; it doesn't give us any insight as to what they are referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.093" offset="10759794">And the other times, when it is referring to payments... specific payments from living, absent parents, it is in the context of the IV-D system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.914" offset="10791036">And clearly, if you are talking about IV-D payments, you can only be talking about living, absent parent payments, because that is the only kind of payments that can be funneled through the IV-D system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.305" offset="10840669">Again, in our own complaint in district court, we offered... we differentiated between Social Security Title II payments and other forms of child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.779" offset="10886540">But that was in the context of talking about the effects of sibling deeming, and it would be natural to differentiate in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.468" offset="10925306">Congress did not create classes of child support, some of which would get the mitigating effects of the disregard and others which would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.407" offset="10961041">All child support payments, any child support payments are entitled to the disregard under the language which congress itself chose to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.180" offset="11000120">And we contend that the language means what it says, that if there is a payment for the support of children, coming from a parent, whatever the nature of that payment, that payment is entitled to the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.930" offset="11107118">I would want to close by talking briefly about how sibling deeming operates vis-a-vis the disregard, and the best example for that is the family of Geneva Powers, which is one of the named plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.940" offset="11167200">Ms. Powers had a family of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.292" offset="11176604">She was receiving SSI payments of $336 a month for panic attacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.731" offset="11210354">She in addition was receiving $207 a month in ADC for her daughters Nancy and Loretta Powers, who she had by her ex-husband Roy Powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.205" offset="11256225">And for her third child, Crystal McClanahan, who was by her deceased husband Ralph McClanahan, she was receiving $254 a month in Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.245" offset="11296349">Now, after sibling deeming went into effect, the... and Crystal McClanahan was forced into the assistance unit, the $207 ADC check was reduced to $11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.386" offset="11344937">Now, if that $254 check had been from a living Ralph McClanahan who was making payments pursuant to a court order, the Powers family would have received an additional $50 a month to work with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.895" offset="11398958">But simply because Mr. McClanahan was deceased and the payments were coming through Title II, even though the function and the purpose of the payments were not merely similar in the two situations, they are absolutely identical, but no disregard for Ms. Powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.988" offset="11463324">We contend that that is contrary to the plain language that Congress chose to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.376" offset="11480878">It is contrary to the purpose of the disregard statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.213" offset="11500209">And it is contrary to 50 years of legislative history and opinions of this Court construing what is the nature of Title II.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="2853.603" offset="11553812">Just a few brief points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.872" offset="11566873">First, in view of the question about whether the term child's insurance benefits is in the statute, at 37a and 38a of the petition you will see that the term is in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.030" offset="11611490">Second, Respondents mentioned that there would be an incentive rationale with Title II benefits as well, in terms of trying to get somebody to apply for Title II benefits, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.219" offset="11652241">And I would just point that, unlike the problem of payments from absent parents, there is no long-standing emphasis of this problem, this incentive problem in the AFDC program, there is no sustained congressional effort to get at that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.664" offset="11714099">And third, just to clarify one point in Justice Stevens' questions, earned income does get its own disregard in many circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.918" offset="11743043">It can be lost if somebody doesn't comply with certain requirements, but it does get its own disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.405" offset="11764986">However, there are many categories of unearned income that do not get any disregard at all.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="2910.876" stopTime="2939.376">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2910.876" offset="11782853">May I ask you this question, Mr. Sloan, about his argument that if you look at the legislative history from '82 through '84, that you find in '82 and '83 there was concern about the sibling deeming program's effect on Title II recipients as well as support payments, and therefore if you read the whole legislative history as a package, it is fair to assume this mitigation purpose motivated his clients as well as the support people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.126" offset="11891941">What do you say about that argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clifford_m_sloan" startTime="2939.376" stopTime="3009.722">
            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="2939.376" offset="11896852">Well, if you look at the legislative history you find Social Security payments and child support payments being identified, including in 1984, by the Senate as categories of income... principal categories of income, that they do want to include that had been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.821" offset="11962680">It's... they are given as examples of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.607" offset="11973861">Now... and it is true that the Senate had been pushing for it, the House had been resisting it, and it does come in conference without any explanation of the disregard provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.628" offset="12013880">Now, Respondents suggest that that means, because it came as part of this compromise in conference, it must have a mitigation purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.818" offset="12042720">There is no conference report explanation to that effect, and it is possible to hypothesize other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.120" offset="12063931">To give one example, it might be that the House thought that a child support disregard was a very good idea because of the incentive purpose and so on, but it is costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.542" offset="12093606">It is turning out to be very costly to the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.828" offset="12102697">And so it could only get into the program as part of horse trading when they were also doing a major cost-saving initiative that the Senate had wanted to do, and it was part of a kind of legislative compromise that comes out of conferences all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.969" offset="12151284">Whether the reason for that compromise was the reason that Respondents suggest, or this reason, there is nothing in the legislative history to--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3009.722" stopTime="3011.824">
            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3009.722" offset="12178243">Of course, the disregard would add costs to the program.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clifford_m_sloan" startTime="3011.824" stopTime="3052.984">
            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="3011.824" offset="12186707">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.307" offset="12188587">That is my point, is that the Senate, with the family income requirement, was going to be saving costs, and so then the House had been resisting that, and so it is perfectly plausible to think that the House said okay, if we are going to give you this savings, which is estimated to be $455 million over the next few years, we think this program is a good idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.703" offset="12262253">It won't eat up all of that, and here is a way to fund it in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.123" offset="12283882">And so you won't get your $455 million savings, but you'll still get savings, and we'll further this worthy purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.594" offset="12305825">There is no explanation in the reports one way or the other, but what there is is the statutory term IV and had a particular history in Congress' attention to that problem.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3052.984" offset="12351382">Mr. Sloan, why does the government... why does the government include voluntary payments, which I would not normally consider child support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.424" offset="12385133">I mean, if I am divorced and I am visiting and I say, you know, here is some money for the kid, that would be... that would come under the exclusion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clifford_m_sloan" startTime="3069.911" stopTime="3148.580">
            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="3069.911" offset="12419092">Yes, it would, Justice Scalia, and it would if it was acknowledged by one of the parents to be support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.450" offset="12445214">The reason for that is because the Secretary's interpretation has been tied to the assignment provision in 402(a)(26), which requires the assignment of rights to support from other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.575" offset="12493698">The legislative history in 1975 makes it clear that that is addressed to child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.359" offset="12508849">The Secretary's interpretation really focuses on child support as that which can be assigned the right to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.965" offset="12539255">And the Secretary has interpreted when somebody goes on AFDC and they assign any rights to support from their payment, from... excuse me, from their parent, when the parent then makes a payment, that is part of what has been assigned to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.790" offset="12590560">And actually the person, the recipient is under an obligation to turn that over to the state and get it into the IV-D system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.694" offset="12618145">That's where, the point that I was trying to make before, about there are two kinds of payments from absent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.415" offset="12637058">There is direct payments and there are those that go to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.533" offset="12649492">Voluntary payments can be either one, and if they are direct payments then they should either be returned to the state or there is another procedure to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.603" offset="12677809">But the reason that the Secretary has treated voluntary payments in that way is because they would be within the assignment of rights to the state under 602(a)(26).</text>
