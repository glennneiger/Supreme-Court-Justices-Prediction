            <label>Mr. Timothy K. Ford</label>
            <text syncTime="28.483" offset="255002">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="271616">This case presents three issues regarding the constitutionality of aspects of Arizona's death sentencing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.958" offset="304844">I'd like to begin by briefly addressing the last of those that is discussed in our briefs, the constitutionality of the provision of Arizona law that makes murder a capital crime if it is committed in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.039" offset="377255">That issue is before the Court, of course, in another case, Lewis v. Jeffers, which will be argued I believe immediately after the recess the Court is about to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.394" offset="414662">And it is our submission, as it is the submission of the Respondent in Lewis, that the case is directly controlled by this Court's decision in Maynard v. Cartwright, holding almost identical language in the Oklahoma statute to have failed to control sentencing discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.772" offset="492194">The... Professor Rosen, who wrote the seminal article on this... it was relied on in Maynard and also the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals en banc and the Adamson case, have also reviewed the Arizona statute, its application, in great detail, and come to the conclusion that there is no way in which it can be distinguished from the Oklahoma statute in Maynard.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.035" offset="577248">Since Adamson, of course, the Arizona court has gone even farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.987" offset="593026">This case was decided by the Arizona Supreme Court after Adamson, and that court continued to take steps to stretch the breadth of this aggravating circumstance even to greater lengths.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.211" offset="645898">In this case, affirming a trial judge's finding of the aggravating circumstance which was unadorned by any explanation of what the trial judge's understanding of what the circumstance meant, which followed arguments by the prosecution with regard to an interpretation of the statute which the Arizona Supreme Court rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.923" offset="724788">And in this case, the Arizona court took the final step in a series of decisions by which it ultimately said that the fear of a robbery victim, a person who is not necessarily even going to be the victim of a homicide, the uncertainty of... as to the person's fate is sufficient to constitute suffering which is sufficient to constitute cruelty, which is sufficient to make out the statute and qualify a defendant in that kind of a case for a sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.208" offset="845892">And in this case, as we pointed out in our--</text>

            <text syncTime="178.460" offset="854878">That... that is different from... from just in the course of a robbery suddenly shooting someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.666" offset="883717">I mean, I... I suppose holding someone hostage in... as occurred in this case, debating with your accomplices whether you will kill him or not while he's lying there on the ground... I suppose that is something in addition to merely killing somebody in the course of a robbery, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="203.211" offset="953934">--Well, I can't refrain, Justice Scalia, from pointing out that there isn't, of course, any testimony that such a debate occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.865" offset="980475">That... that debate is a product of the rhetoric of the Arizona Attorney General and the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.435" offset="1006806">According to the witness, the discussion was over what the person would be tied up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.923" offset="1024778">But, again, to take the Court's hypothetical, there are always those facts that can be said to distinguish one homicide from another, to constitute as... cruelty because every homicide, as the Court has pointed out in Maynard, is... could be said by a reasonable person to be cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.598" offset="1091443">You can always find a fact in any case that says, well, that's a cruel fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.505" offset="1547123">It seems to me that that's exactly what the court of criminal appeals did in Maynard and in actually in some ways worse because in a court of criminal appeals in Maynard we had a jury instruction... we knew what that jury was told constituted heinous, atrocious or cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.014" offset="1609085">In this situation, because we don't have... we have bench trials in Arizona, and that's an issue I want to come in a second... we don't know what definition was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.537" offset="1643253">The trial judge never said, I'm applying this definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.739" offset="1656001">And the Arizona Supreme Court has said in the past and very critically in the Rumsey case that came to this Court that it is not the sentencing body, that it is a reviewing body, and the discretion that is to be confined I think is the discretion of the sentencing body that can be controlled by rules set in advance and not just changed on a case-by-case basis as cases are analogized to facts that may have been incidental in a prior crime and then become the sine qua non of this factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.508" offset="1779090">I would like to spend some time talking about the first issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.412" offset="1798734">It is a classic conflict between the expansion of judicial power at the expense of the traditional role of one of our democratic institutions, the criminal trial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.303" offset="1846277">The State of Arizona here is claiming that it may transfer the most basic core functions of the trial jury to a judge... take it away from the jury where it has been for at least 300 years in English and American law, by simply changing its label.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.626" offset="5807590">They're inconvenient, they don't necessarily go along with what the government wants, they don't necessarily find the facts the way the... as Justice White pointed out in Duncan... that the more practiced and professional eye of a judge would like it, and people often try and make incursions on their power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.995" offset="11229043">They don't say anything as an element or not that has to be decided by what the thing does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.133" offset="11249627">With regard to the defendant's having actually committed the actus reus, pulling the trigger, the aggravating factors that were found here under the statute are... and, unfortunately, one of the things that happens when you get sloppy with judge sentencing is, if you'll notice, the judge's findings are not even in the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.893" offset="11312635">But the statute says the defendant committed the murder in a heinous, cruel or depraved fashion, especially; the defendant committed the murder for expectation of something of pecuniary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.599" offset="11351400">That's a paraphrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.784" offset="11356207">And, of course, the essence of the judge's finding that this was heinous... or at least the Arizona Supreme Court's finding... gloss on in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.955" offset="11384837">What they say was heinous about it is that Mr. Walton pulled the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.056" offset="11397271">That's what made him eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.722" offset="11403959">That is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.956" offset="11408870">Every issue, actus reus, mens reus, down the line, is converted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.543" offset="11431230">And the answer that Arizona gives is the one that they have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.412" offset="11442724">We call it sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.614" offset="11447531">And when we call it sentencing, the Sixth Amendment vanishes and the right to jury trial vanishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.934" offset="11468742">I don't think that that is a sufficient answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.401" offset="11478669">I don't think that the phrase "element of the offense" or "aggravating circumstance" is a talisman.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.148" offset="11981683">As there was... as it was fought for in William Penn's case and John Peter Zenger's case where the judges tried to say, oh, well, the libelousness is a question of law, we'll take that away, the Colonists said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.690" offset="12027867">And Zenger's case was very much in the minds of the framers of the Constitution and Blackstone and the people who they were looking to understand why... it tells us why they put those words in the Constitution twice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.589" offset="12351368">The rhetoric of a prosecutor could say, imagine the pain, imagine the fear, imagine the agony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.426" offset="12370803">The defendant should have known he would have done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.878" offset="12380520">And that rhetoric can drive the rage that people feel when these homicides occur and cause death to be imposed in a fashion that is not regular and arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.400" offset="12418659">And we have cited many, many cases where Arizona judges, like the prosecutor in this case and like the trial judge in this case, at least by his ruling, did not understand that this was the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.506" offset="12455126">If you look at the prosecutor's argument, he wasn't talking about what the Arizona Supreme Court ultimately held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.743" offset="12476024">He had a completely different idea of what the statute meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.445" offset="12494832">Our... the middle issue which I did not address is not here as an abstract issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.663" offset="12511759">There was serious mitigating evidence in this case which was brought forth in a very haphazard fashion because we live in an imperfect world and because judge sentencing in Arizona is a very informal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.621" offset="12559511">But we know Mr. Walton had a terrible childhood, he had a drug abuse history, he was living in poverty at the time of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.940" offset="12584798">All that came in in a very vague undefined fashion and there is no indication it was given any weight by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.178" offset="12613741">We have to assume that was because of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.563" offset="12623355">Thank you.</text>
