            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="200774">This case concerns the constitutionality of the Montgomery Amendment which removes from states the power to withhold consent to foreign training of the National Guard because of objections to location, purpose, type and schedule of that training.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.685" offset="263990">It's codified at Title 10, Section 672(f) and was enacted in November 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.839" offset="292621">The Montgomery Amendment effectively nullifies clause 16, and before I begin, let me just reference the three most relevant constitutional provisions, because they are referenced a lot in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.064" offset="337447">Article I, Section 8, clause 12 gives Congress the power to raise and support armies, clause 15 gives Congress the power to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, to suppress insurrections, and to repel invasions, and clause 16 gives Congress the power to provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, but reserving to the states respectively the appointment of the officers and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.058" offset="501496">Now, the Montgomery Amendment effectively nullifies clause 16 by removing states' powers to consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.462" offset="527096">It permits unlimited Federal authority over training, and leaves no control or authority to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.366" offset="554681">The Montgomery Amendment is unconstitutional because it violates the plain language and meaning of clause 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.554" offset="583416">It overturns long settled understandings of the relationship among the clauses of Article I, Section 8, and it upsets a carefully established framework eliminating a fundamental part of the checks and balances as established by the framers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.843" offset="5248572">In fact, the Solicitor General in arguing that the Selective Draft Law was constitutional assured the court that had had no impact on peacetime training of the National Guard which was reserved to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.301" offset="5294443">And that really in that case if you look at it properly, there was no conflict between the clauses because the militia clauses do not give rights to individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.763" offset="5364242">To the extent that I think Selective Draft Law cases is relevant here, they recognize that Congress has very strong powers during wartime and during emergency situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.109" offset="5641662">Many wanted to retain plenary state control over the militia because they greatly feared, the framers greatly feared, the effect of a large standing federal army, and they believed that state control would be a very important... a very important check on misuse of the federal... federal army.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.093" offset="6677574">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.997" offset="6693248">The army clause of the United States Constitution provides in broad terms that the Congress shall have power to raise and support armies, and consistent with the breadth of the text of the Constitution this Court has broadly construed this clause and the powers that are granted under this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.815" offset="6800454">The Court has described the powers granted under it as plenary, as broad and sweeping and, importantly for purposes of this case, as not limited by the militia clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.424" offset="6862939">Coupled with the necessary and proper clause, there is little doubt... and we have heard today... that there is no dispute that Congress had the power under the army clause to create an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.369" offset="6930753">That entity is the National Guard of the United States, and it created it as a component of the armed forces of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.260" offset="6982266">When it created the National Guard of the United States in 1933, Congress was very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.846" offset="7016643">It relied expressly on this Court's World War I decisions in the Selective Draft Law cases and Cox against Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.304" offset="7062410">And the theory of those cases is that to the extent that Congress exercises its powers under the army clause the efficacy, the sweep of the militia clause is thereby limited.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.935" offset="13884967">Dual enlistment merely created a reserve force which relies completely on the states, on the National Guard, that the state organize militias for its members.</text>

            <text syncTime="3458.385" offset="13978799">These are the same people, and you just cannot wave this magic wand and eliminate constitutional protections, constitutional limitations, which were the essence of a compromise that the framers made 200 years ago over the control over the... of the militia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.772" offset="14112337">It has been used in the sense of every able-bodied person who's available, but once it is organized, it is organized as a militia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.497" offset="14155177">And Congress has exercised that power, has organized the militia, and has created the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.966" offset="14177120">That is the entity that we're talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.783" offset="14188405">Now they've gone beyond that to interpret dual enlistment, which has never been interpreted to... to eliminate constitutional protections to... to now require that... that to be done under the army clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.010" offset="14241277">In 1933, when dual enlistment was created, its use as a federal force, the National Guard of the United States was expressly limited to emergencies, relying on the Selective Draft Law cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.135" offset="14289760">When that was changed to bring the National Guard into federal training for the first time in 1952, it was done only pursuant to the governors' consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.424" offset="14326959">State authority over training has been consistently recognized for 200 years, until the enactment of the Montgomery Amendment.</text>
