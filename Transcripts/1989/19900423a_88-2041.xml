            <text syncTime="167.331" offset="812622">The district court dismissed the petition for limitation of liability on the grounds there was no subject matter admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.977" offset="855254">The admiralty jurisdiction of the United States courts is derived from Article 3 of the Constitution and the judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.034" offset="895483">It confers on the courts the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.098" offset="915754">Today those two terms are used synonymously, but in past times, in colonial times and in European times, the admiralty law generally dealt with just the sea, the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.809" offset="974581">The maritime law dealt with matters of contract, maritime liens, finance, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.023" offset="999450">They have been combined in Article 3 into one judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.739" offset="1030274">In colonial times, as well as in the... basically the first 180, 190 years of this country, the tests for admiralty jurisdiction was generally the situs test.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.461" offset="1101118">If the... if the accident took place, or the tort took place on a navigable waterway, it has since been extended to the Great Lakes, the western rivers, then you had admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.089" offset="1147721">This Court had a problem with that... with that test the way it had been described in Executive Jet, where a small commercial aircraft, in taking off, struck some birds, essentially crashed and skidded into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.001" offset="1235283">The owners of the aircraft sued the airport under admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.256" offset="1260361">We believe that the Court rightly ruled there was no admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.271" offset="1288364">But the reason that we think should have been used is there was no vessel involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.905" offset="1310934">If you review the tort cases in the first 180 years of admiralty jurisdiction, the facts disclose you have a vessel involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.221" offset="1356178">It is not just the situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.224" offset="1368194">It is not just the navigable water.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.200" offset="4580106">And you could have a fire that would do damage to all sorts of different types of boats and have all sorts of different types of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.447" offset="4613125">And I think for uniformity on the navigable waters that the test of a vessel in navigable water is sufficient to keep out the... if it's not a vessel it is probably not a traditional maritime activity, but there may be some.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.786" offset="4678431">The sea plane, for example, is a bridge between the vessel and the airplane, so at some point it is a traditional maritime activity if it is operating as a vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.669" offset="4737990">We also feel that our test is in agreement with what Congress has done in the Extension Act, where they extend the admiralty jurisdiction to vessels, without describing the type of vessel, on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.493" offset="4825239">It's consistent with the wording in the limitation act which refers to vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.688" offset="4850108">And again, we don't feel that it would cause this Court to have to overrule any prior decisions, so that roughly 200 years of maritime jurisprudence would stay intact with our definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.479" offset="4917190">The limitation act provides a separate, as I have already indicated, a separate basis of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.337" offset="4964629">We feel that that was confirmed in the Richardson v. Harmon case, and it has been confirmed again in the supplemental rules that were propounded by this Court, the Supplemental Admiralty Rules, which conferred jurisdiction on the Federal court to hear limitation of liability cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1386.101" offset="5687698">This wasn't the intent of Congress in drafting the Limitation of Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.055" offset="5703581">In fact, this Court early on stated that the Limitation of Liability Act is a part of the general maritime laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.809" offset="5730539">And it is our position that the requirements of general admiralty jurisdiction should be applied to the Limitation of Liability Act, just as it's applied to every other general admiralty case coming before the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.070" offset="5791561">And the reason for that is because the admiral... admiralty courts of the United States have a certain expertise and interest in matters which are strictly admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.577" offset="5829595">And what has happened in the recent... past, is that with a proliferation of pleasure craft upon the waterways, the Federal courts are being confronted with common law, garden variety tort cases which have nothing to do with the traditional maritime activity which this Court required for Federal jurisdiction in the Executive Jet case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.935" offset="12071084">I mean, I assume you have commercial boats on inland... some inland waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.296" offset="12180485">The issue hasn't come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.339" offset="12192710">I had one, but it got settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.171" offset="12200025">Secondly, Phenix, we feel, was out of step with Richardson and Butler and Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.128" offset="12243806">Phenix was a case where it's really form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.802" offset="12270555">The Court found there was no jurisdiction under the limitation action because of the place that the lawsuit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.709" offset="12302111">This has been subsequently corrected in the supplemental Rule F, paragraph 9, which allows the limitation action to be filed where the vessel is, where the owner has been sued, where the vessel has been arrested, or any other district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.473" offset="12381210">At the time of Phenix there were the admiralty rules that were more restrictive as to venue, so that in a sense the venue became jurisdictional, that the lawsuit then had to be filed someplace else but not in the court that was addressing the Phenix case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.296" offset="12448501">Recreational boats are a matter of Federal concern, and Congress has passed many regulations concerning the operation, safety, fire fighting, life saving, et cetera, for the pleasure craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.273" offset="12544423">In fact, 46 U.S.C., under the Recreational Boating Act, preempts state law on the regulation and operation of boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.471" offset="12589249">It will allow state law to have the same requirement that the Federal law requires, but no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.338" offset="12620701">The U.S. Coast Guard has a life-saving station at Michigan City which was right next to this marina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.075" offset="12659571">If there has to be an impact on commerce, we have a fire in the middle of the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.629" offset="12681827">As I understand the people that were awakened, sleeping on their boats, was immediately to get their boats out of the way, to get away from the flames.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.514" offset="12717354">There was an oil line that went... a gasoline line that went right under the dock in front of our boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.308" offset="12740550">People were afraid that that was going to blow up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.280" offset="12752462">If the fire had spread it could have gone right to the Coast Guard station, which is situated literally at the end of this dock, and that provides the life saving for commercial as well as recreational craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.091" offset="12811708">That Coast Guard station also supervises the navigational aids in that part of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.867" offset="12834800">As far as the number of... of boats, recreational boats that we have now or in the time of Washington, the boats that were registered in Washington's time, I assume, because there was a statute, were registered with the U.S. government, as Mr. Sisson's boat was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.052" offset="12935528">It was enrolled under the laws of the United States with the U.S. Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.099" offset="12959665">Today we have statistics that go beyond the vessels that are enrolled, your... usually your rowboat or your small sailboat are not enrolled with the Coast Guard, but large vessels such as this are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.277" offset="13020374">This is a boat that is designed, as any commercial ship is, for people to literally live on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.173" offset="13115982">And most lending institutions, boats of this size are... usually you borrow money to buy a boat of this size, so the lending institutions require that you have this type of enrollment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.291" offset="13164465">We also get... if we are going to look at commerce, which is not set out in any of the statutes, and in the history of the admiralty side of the court, commerce was not the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.374" offset="13232802">Commerce is mentioned as the underpinning originally for the limitation act, which has been amended many times in the last century and in this century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.290" offset="13276478">Congress has never amended it to include Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.283" offset="13288495">It includes pleasure craft, in spite of lower courts suggesting that admiralty jurisdiction should not be extended to pleasure craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.121" offset="13327783">Congress has never amended out the inclusion of all vessels on all waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.178" offset="13352025">But what is commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.619" offset="13369788">These boats now are... are built all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.030" offset="13387447">We see them go down our highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.852" offset="13398732">There is not admiralty jurisdiction yet, but they are in the stream of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.756" offset="13414301">They are bought and sold, they are insured, they buy fuel, they pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.908" offset="13434989">People hire crew members to work on pleasure craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.601" offset="13449723">Mr. Trump's yacht's got a crew that is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.366" offset="13468740">That is a very large yacht, but it is still a pleasure craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.448" offset="13485145">I would suggest that all of these boats are part of... part of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.883" offset="13510849">We are a changing society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.686" offset="13518059">We are becoming a service society, we are becoming a society that has a lot of recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.060" offset="13543554">It is big business in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.770" offset="13550346">And it is using the natural resource, the resource that the admiralty courts used to supervise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.284" offset="13576469">The commercial court, which you will find still in Europe... there used to be a distinction where matters that happened on the water involving vessels were handled in the admiralty court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.041" offset="13619518">Matters involving loss of cargo, liens, contracts, bills of lading, were handled in a commercial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.047" offset="13647522">In this country it is all combined together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.690" offset="13662046">I submit that the admiralty jurisdiction under the Constitution extends to navigable waters for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.824" offset="13702588">It has been traditionally used and extended to vessels operating on navigable waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.358" offset="13784717">That it is a vessel, it is on a navigable water, it should be covered by the admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
