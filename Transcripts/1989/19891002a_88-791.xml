            <label>Mr. Jacob Laufer</label>
            <text syncTime="12.261" offset="186588">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.057" offset="197768">This case is before the court on a petition of certiorari through a view of decision of the U.S. Court of appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.320" offset="222846">At issue in this case is the interpretation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and more, specifically, whether under Rule 11 a district court is empowered to impose sanctions not only upon the attorney who signs a paper or pleading that offends the rule, but the district court... whether the district court may also impose sanctions upon the law firm or law partnership or employer of such an attorney who has signed such a pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.451" offset="323365">Now, the context in which this has arisen is a case in which, after trial, the district court imposed significant monetary sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.243" offset="362549">The sanctions were predicated upon a factual claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.102" offset="377909">That factual claim is referred throughout as the facsimile claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.506" offset="391597">That claim appeared very early in the litigation in the amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.051" offset="409778">It was used... it was used at, at another point in the litigation to defeat a motion for summary judgment that the Respondents had filed, and that claim was ultimately abandoned and withdrawn immediately prior to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.811" offset="468815">The district court found that while that claim had not been interposed in bad faith, that claim had not been researched adequately in terms of its factual foundation by the attorney, and accordingly determined that sanctions were appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.978" offset="525448">The district court, in terms of the attorney sanctions, created basically two categories of attorney sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.991" offset="549481">The first attorney sanction was against the signer himself, and that was for the first half, this is after... finally after a hearing on... or an argument under Rule 60(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="113.595" offset="591904">The Court found that during the first half of the litigation, the signer basically stood alone, and, and imposed those sanctions against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.748" offset="624504">The Court found that thereafter, during the approximate midpoint of the litigation, the signer of the pleading had formed a firm, which is now the Petitioner before this Court of Pavelic &amp; LeFlore, and according... accordingly apportioned half of the sanctions, the latter half of the sanctions, against both &amp; LeFlore.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.459" offset="715411">The issue came up before the U.S. Court of appeals for the Second Circuit and that court determined, based upon its view of the purpose of Rule 11, that it was appropriate that sanctions could be imposed by the district court, presumptively it, it indicated, because that would, in the view of the Second Circuit Court of appeals, promote the purpose of Rule 11 in the sense, the court felt, that law firms and employers would be motivated by this presumption that the Second Circuit was creating to monitor more, more specifically and with, with greater vigor the pleadings that were signed by all of its attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.803" offset="860756">And accordingly, the Court of appeals for the Second Circuit created this rule, which we submit is without textural foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.674" offset="888237">We claim that the district court did not have the power under this case to impose sanctions upon Pavelic &amp; LeFlore, upon the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.484" offset="927420">In order to reach that conclusion, Your Honors, we go first and principally to the words of Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.590" offset="951871">The words of Rule 11 indicate, first, that insofar as attorneys are concerned in the case of represented parties, a, a pleading or any paper that is to be considered by a district court must be signed by at least one attorney of record in his individual name, and that attorney must give his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.957" offset="1025327">And it go... goes on from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.160" offset="1030134">But the, the, the rule itself specifically requires that an attorney who signs the pleading sign in his individual name.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.250" offset="1058555">Incidentally, Your Honors, this has been the course of Rule 11 since the very inception of Rule 11, when it was first promulgated in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.622" offset="1088021">There was a very early district court decision in which there was a United States against American Surety, where a, a signature appeared, a, a firm of attorneys by so and so, a member of the firm, and there was actually a motion to strike that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.179" offset="1146222">And the district court, in, in reading Rule 11 back 50 years ago, said we know this, this is a signature of an individual attorney, we know who this attorney is, he is front and center before us and he is strictly responsible, and he has therefore complied with Rule 11 as it was then created and as it now exists, I would submit, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.406" offset="1223126">Following this requirement within the rule, that an attorney in his individual name sign such a pleading, the, the rule explains what that signature means.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.183" offset="1266281">That rule is a certificate, a certificate being a written assurance, a written representation by the signer of the pleading, that the signer has read the pleading, that the signer warrants that the pleading meets the factual and legal requirements that are set out in the rule, meaning a factual, a factual inquiry that is reasonable under all of the circumstances, a legal inquiry that is reasonable under all of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.627" offset="1360008">The signer further warrants that the, the pleading is not interposed for any improper purpose and some of those purposes, improper purposes, are articulated within the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.232" offset="1394490">And then we come to the operative language of the rule itself, and the operative language of the rule says that upon finding a violation, if a violation is found, the district court shall impose upon the person who signed it, that is the person, the attorney of record in his individual name who has signed it, who has given his address--</text>

            <text syncTime="421.737" offset="1824465">--Your Honor, I believe that that is not so, because I believe, first, we have the language of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.781" offset="1844632">An attorney of record, at least one of attorney of record, in his individual name, in that attorney's individual name.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.045" offset="1865739">We come to the antecedent of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.090" offset="1877860">We see how we come by this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.980" offset="1885487">The antecedent of this rule is Rule 11 of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.681" offset="1900220">And Rule 11 of 1938 did not encompass an attorney and a party the way this rule structurally and grammatically must encompass.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.351" offset="1930940">It encompassed an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.851" offset="1936896">And it indicated that the attorney warranted that he read it, that he was, was, was satisfied and was making the certification to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.159" offset="1974199">The Advisory Committee's notes indicate that it was the intention of the Advisory Committee that, that the rule continue in its application to anyone who signs a pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.731" offset="2024459">The test that the district courts are exhorted by the Advisory Committee notes to, to use in ascertaining whether the tests of the rule have been met deal with the signer's conduct, the attorney who signed it, the person who signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.758" offset="2080570">I believe that while it is indeed true that the law firm is or are the attorneys for a particular party, that is without question, but for purposes of the rule, that person who was called to task, who makes a written assurance to the court, a, a, a representation to the court for which that person is sanctioned or punished, is one particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.890" offset="2165102">There are references in the Advisory Committee notes to other attorneys, but the only such reference has to do with testing the signer's conduct, meaning whether or not the signer... what the signer did was reasonable under the circumstances may depend on whether that signed relied upon another member of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.397" offset="2239081">So I would submit, Your Honor, that the rule does not... does not give, give, give latitude to be interpreted, I would submit, that the signature of the signer in his individual name is the signature of a law firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.344" offset="2298953">I, I could not understand the rule under other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.546" offset="2311701">And frankly, if I might suggest, Your Honor, that that is not terribly distinct perhaps even from the rule of this Court, Rule 33.2, which, which requires that the counsel of record before this Court be an individual member of the bar of this Court, and that a, a, a law firm may not be the counsel of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.117" offset="2385993">Now the law firm are the attorneys, without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.913" offset="2397174">Many such lawyers who are counsel of record before this Court are members of, of law firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.707" offset="2416400">But the law firm is not the counsel of record, nor, I, I, I submit, is the law firm the attorney of record, as contemplated by the plain language of Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.500" offset="2451509">As I have indicated, the structure of Rule 11, the grammar of Rule 11, all militate very strongly in favor of this interpretation, and indeed I would submit they militate conclusively in favor of this interpretation that I am urging upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.822" offset="2532802">Confirmation, of course, is, is found I believe if we go beyond the actual language of the rule itself, if we go to the Advisory Committee notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.348" offset="2570940">Again, the entire focus is riveted, it's purely riveted to an individual attorney, who makes a promise to the court and who is held accountable.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.470" offset="2607407">Under the earlier version of the rule, under Rule 11 of 1938, the accountability was in terms purely of a disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.294" offset="2638754">And as the Advisory Committee notes indicate, there was some reluctance on the part of courts to, to, to use disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.885" offset="2665086">There was confusion regarding the circumstances that might trigger it, and, and, and, and as well--</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.456" offset="10939319">The principal challenge to the interpretation of the Second Circuit by the Petitioner in reliance on the Fifth Circuit case of Robinson versus National Cash Register is that the Second Circuit violated the plain meaning of the rule and thereby legislated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.116" offset="11049974">But both courts, Your Honors, could not discern a plain meaning to the... rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.158" offset="11098144">Both courts had to resort to policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.484" offset="11123430">The Second Circuit at, at the... in the petition, page 60a, makes a reference that the... of a lack of plain meaning, and specifically, the Fifth Circuit at 808 Fed Second 1128 held it is unclear, however, whether Rule 11 sanctions can only be imposed on an attorney who actually signs a document or whether sanctions can also be imposed on an attorney who did not sign the document deemed to violate Rule 11 but who made an appearance in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.392" offset="11267104">The Fifth Circuit emphasized the... their concern about satellite litigation, and that if a non-signer was held liable they would have to enquire into the relative culpability of attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.898" offset="11349128">The Second Circuit emphasized deterrence and the internal monitoring that was necessary and should be necessary to avoid frivolous filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.518" offset="11399597">We respectfully contend that the Fifth Circuit interpretation weakened the prime objective and orientation of the rule deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.952" offset="11441288">The example I gave before, which I believe should be restated and restated, is the silent partner instructing the junior or associate to sign the frivolous paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.354" offset="11482980">It is a potential for sharp practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.572" offset="11491861">The Fifth Circuit, moreover, was unrealistic in encouraging multiple participants in preparation of one legal document all to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.490" offset="11535538">I don't think that will happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.147" offset="11542121">The Second Circuit applied the advisors' comments: the district court retains the necessary flexibility to deal appropriately with violations of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.844" offset="11596873">It has discretion to tailor sanctions to the particular facts of the case with which it should be well acquainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.684" offset="11628220">This was a built-in safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.496" offset="11639505">And I would respectfully suggest, contrary to the argument of the Petitioner, that the Second Circuit legislated the adoption of partnership law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.320" offset="11682764">That there is a material difference between the... the traditional application of partnership law and the formulation, the flexible formulation in the Second... of the Second Circuit in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.361" offset="11738980">As I understand partnership law, in the course of the partnership and with the authority of the partners, if a fraudulent misrepresentation is made upon a third party, the partnership is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.246" offset="11790493">In terms of the, the formulation of the Second Circuit, the exceptional circumstances, if there was a fraud on the partnership, if there was a showing of an internal monitoring system, and if the partnership could not reasonably detect by its supervisory mechanisms the, the fraud, the, the frivolous filing, then it would be appropriate to relieve the partnership and impose the full weight of the sanction on the individual wrongdoer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.513" offset="12255577">Justice Scalia, if, if the individual lawyer could show that he conducted a pre-filing inquiry, that a reasonably competent lawyer could conclude the bonafides of the legal claim, he would be able to exonerate himself from the... imposition of a Rule 11 finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.379" offset="12343035">But what I am saying in this particular case, assume that there was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.674" offset="12364246">In the ordinary typical case, as this case was, traditional partnership principles should apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.178" offset="12474274">We do not believe that the Second Circuit legislated, nor did they exercise in a raw fashion, the inherent power of the court which has always been a power to regulate attorneys who practice before it and to discipline attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.245" offset="12602483">That power, I presume, was carried over by the enabling act in Rules 1, 7 and 11, and through the amendment of, of Rule 11, and through a new definition of bad faith on objective terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.392" offset="12679074">And it was appropriate in this particular case because the partnership was a knowing participant in the law suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.605" offset="12891920">If Your Honors would look at the two cases, the Robinson case and the Calloway case, as a... as, as the... as a snapshot, the way you would want Rule 11 to operate in the future, you would see that in the Robinson case, a client was sanctioned without discussion for bringing a second action after a defeat in federal court against the principles of res judicata.</text>
