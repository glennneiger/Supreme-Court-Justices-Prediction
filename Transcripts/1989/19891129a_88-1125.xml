            <text syncTime="19.164" offset="220792">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.598" offset="246497">This case presents the constitutionality of a 1981 criminal Minnesota statute requiring both biological parents to be notified prior to a minor's abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.576" offset="294457">The issue here is not one of parental involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.767" offset="311176">The heart of our case is the two-parent requirement which not only is out of step with the reality of family life but which tramples on the integrity of many families.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.155" offset="356733">Because the statutory scheme was written in the alternative, there are two statutory schemes before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.571" offset="394454">Subdivision 2, where we are the appellees, requires that both biological parents be notified 48 hours prior to any teenager's abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.190" offset="436877">This notification requirement is imposed across-the-board regardless of whether the minor lives in a no-parent, one-parent or two-parent household, regardless of whether she is mature, or whether it would be in her best interest to have a private abortion, regardless of whether she has ever met the absent parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.152" offset="516707">Under subdivision 2, no bypass option is possible with this notice even when the minor, her natural parent and her stepparent together agree that abortion is the best choice and to notice to the absent family is likely to be destructive to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.804" offset="595388">Subdivision 6, where we're the appellant, was in effect for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.598" offset="618585">It imposes the same notice and waiting period requirement but contains a judicial bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.084" offset="648469">After five weeks of trial and hearing the testimony of some 57 witnesses, the trial court federal court judge in Minnesota made comprehensive findings of fact as to the impact and the operation of this law on minors, on medical practice, on their privacy rights and on their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.027" offset="736240">50 percent of minors in Minnesota who are seeking abortions do not live with both biological parents.</text>

            <label>Ms. Janet Benshoof</label>
            <text syncTime="163.758" offset="799143">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.539" offset="802278">Far from helping minors or families, this statute tries to force a parental role where one may never have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.694" offset="834879">It undermined families that do exist and drove minors from timely, critical medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.500" offset="862150">I would first like to address subdivision 2, where we are the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.051" offset="884302">The state argues that biological parents have a right to know, a right which they contend is older in history than any privacy or bodily integrity rights of minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.640" offset="930696">They further argue that having a judicial bypass defeats these constitutional rights of parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.244" offset="953161">However, in Ashcroft, Akron and Bellotti, this Court clearly held that an effective bypass mechanism had to be held for any parental involvement requirement in order to ensure that mature minors and best interest minors were not forced to forego those privacy rights recognized in Danforth.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.819" offset="1039470">This Court has consistently recognized both the unique and the non-postponable nature of the abortion decision, and the fact that imposition of unwanted motherhood on a teenager is particularly devastating to her future.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.298" offset="1105298">This state's right-to-know theory ignores Danforth in which this Court said that any independent right of the parent that may exist is no more weighty than a minor's privacy right; and, in fact, even the dissent in Danforth in this Court looked at the minor's welfare, not at some independent, completely right of the parent absent any consideration of the welfare of the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.913" offset="1207803">Apart from this right-to-know theory in this case, this Court has never supported the idea of giving fundamental due process rights to any sort of parent who's never lived with the child, acknowledged the child, supported the child, or whose abusive actions to the other parent or the child are destructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.825" offset="1279483">This Court has been repeatedly skeptical of the claims of absentee fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.950" offset="1303933">In Lehr, for example, an unmarried father with no ongoing relationship with the child, was not even entitled to notice of a pending adoption.</text>

            <label>Ms. Janet Benshoof</label>
            <text syncTime="328.939" offset="1459937">Well, the state could promote interests that are not constitutional interests, but then they would be balanced against rights and constitutional interests in the minor and, I might add, her single mother, so that those rights would even be less cognizable than if they would be liberty interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.669" offset="1522839">And I do agree that at... you know, biological parents may have some degree of liberty interests, but this Court has always looked at those interests along a spectrum.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="353.894" offset="1559724">But when the Court looks at those interests, it's generally looking at them in terms of a constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.609" offset="1582608">Someone is saying, I have a liberty interest, the absent parent, the single mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.414" offset="1601834">But when the state comes to legislate, it doesn't have to protect... it's not limited to protecting just constitutional interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.820" offset="1631404">It can protect interests of its citizens as it sees them so long as it doesn't run up against some other constitutional barrier, can't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="380.536" offset="1666304">But in this instance they are framing those in terms of rights and constitutional interests of the parents that are more weighty than the privacy interests of the minor at hand, and they are saying that a bypass procedure, in effect, cuts off those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.445" offset="1725968">Even parents with recognized liberty interests don't have a right to protective state legislation to impinge on privacy interests balanced on the other side.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.740" offset="2911091">Well, Your Honor, I believe that when minors' rights are at stake because, as this Court recognized in Bellotti and I think Justice Stevens particularly recognized in Carey, minors who are pregnant need more protection from this Court than even in other areas because they only have two options left in their life at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="714.846" offset="3003564">For example, in Turner v. Safley, you scrutinized the factual record very carefully to show that there was no fit between forbidding inmate marriages and relating that to the penological concerns of the State of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.426" offset="3069811">Moreover, in Castle v. Consolidated Freightways, which was a 1981 case of this Court, there was a 14-day trial on the safety effects of banning 65-foot trailers in Iowa, and you found that although there was some slight safety benefit, there was not much and it didn't... it wasn't reasonable or rational to require that ban because of its burden on interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.684" offset="3246921">I think that's very apt because first of all we're not saying the state is deprived of authority here, we're not disputing the legitimacy of the state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.561" offset="3282343">Certainly, parental involvement is a laudable and beneficial goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.854" offset="3299584">What we have proved in this case is that the means chosen not only don't achieve that goal, but they undermine that goal; they undermine the very thing the state wants to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.332" offset="3345455">And in Castle you did use a rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.534" offset="3362278">If the test used on trucks in Iowa were applied to minor's health rights, we would win this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.438" offset="3389863">The state argues that somehow notice is different than consent; that somehow notice is less burdensome than consent, and that's another reason why a lesser standard of review should be used by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.898" offset="3455692">I would submit that the facts show the exact opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.733" offset="3475127">That notice is not less burdensome than consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.023" offset="3488292">While parents may perceive a difference in a consent law versus a notice law, from the point of view of minors, whose rights are at stake in this case, there is no difference between them for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.284" offset="3549314">First... first of all, there's no difference between notice and consent for the potential for provoking obstruction and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.640" offset="3586722">The district court reported that there are 31,000 cases of family assault every year in Minnesota, making it the most prevalent violent crime in the State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.486" offset="3630085">The district court further found that notice in these kind of violent, dysfunctional families was nearly always disastrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.903" offset="3659760">In fact, the only two expert witnesses put on trial by the State of Minnesota admitted on cross-examination that yes, it's true in these kinds of cases it would not be beneficial, and yes, it's true, violence could occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.081" offset="3716498">Now there's no reason to believe that parents who would veto an abortion though... through threatened or actual violence, would not equally obstruct a minor's access to a clinic or a court after being notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.652" offset="3778774">In fact, that was precisely what this Court recognized in Bellotti.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.223" offset="3797060">They said, in looking at the fact that the State of Massachusetts required you to be notified... required parents to be notified before going to court said, wait, minors must have the right to go to court first and anonymously, because parents may block access if... to the court itself if they were notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.116" offset="3868635">So violent reactions, such as beating, being thrown out the home, which are not uncommon, are precipitated by the knowledge, not by whether the minor says hey, wait a minute, I'm not asking for consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.765" offset="3919208">Second, the burden on informational privacy, the having to give this very personal information to someone who may be a stranger, both on mature minors and on their single parents, is the same under a notice or consent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.316" offset="3981380">Minors and single parents have compelling reasons for not to disclose a pregnancy for a second biological parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.502" offset="4014190">Several of our class members, and this is all in the record, had dying or disabled parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.327" offset="4037491">One had a father who just had a stroke whose father's doctor said, do not tell him.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.701" offset="4054941">And her mother totally agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.652" offset="4062777">Yet the state wouldn't even give them a bypass; they would force this father with his stroke to be told.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.967" offset="4088064">Now it makes no difference telling that father with the stroke whether or not you're asking him for consent or asking him to sign a form that yes, he has been notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.591" offset="4122545">There is no difference whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.154" offset="4128815">Finally, this Court's cases invalidating parental notice were based on the right of mature minors to decide not to become teenage mothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.830" offset="4171447">And the trial in this case makes clear that a notice requirement imposed on minors, and in this case nearly half went through the bypass, which was no easy task, but the notice requirement itself is such a deterrent that it is an equal deterrent to any form of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.813" offset="4247411">Now the Defendants argue that while all of this may very well be true, that... that there may be some burdens imposed by a notice that... a 72-hour notice that can extend into a week, and there may be some burdens imposed by having to notify an absent parent who is in a mental hospital, a fugitive to justice, dying, or beats the family regularly, or is under an order of protection, that may be true, but there is always the judicial bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.494" offset="4382098">But I would submit that the district court was correct in saying that a judicial bypass cannot immunize the underlying notice requirement from judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.143" offset="4424730">Yes, it is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.993" offset="4432149">It is necessary because there are situations even in intact families where there is violence occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.066" offset="4456390">And in fact, most of the... as the district court found, many of the families which are violent families, are intact families, there is a notice... a reason for this bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.802" offset="4499336">But the two-parent requirement is clearly overbroad because the bypass itself is burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.139" offset="4528697">And you can't just impose this burden without looking at the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.480" offset="4546043">The bypass is burdensome because it takes minors about an average of a week to go through the bypass in Minnesota, which the district court judge found to be medically significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.910" offset="4591809">And this is no small matter for minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.189" offset="4604870">A week increases the mortality risk about 50 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.443" offset="4629948">Oftentimes this stretched into more than a week, and we have several instances of our brief with named plaintiffs who went two or three weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.200" offset="4660981">It also increases other risks, pushing many minors into second trimester abortions, which are offered only in one city in the entire State of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.205" offset="4701001">Some minors had to go out of state, in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.899" offset="4715734">This makes abortions much more expensive and much more dangerous for minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.701" offset="4734960">Moreover, the judicial bypass, especially when one parent has to go along, the court found undermined the kind of communication and support that a single parent was trying to offer her daughter during this time of trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.701" offset="4794937">For example, one of our named plaintiffs, who had not seen her ex-husband for over 10 years, was... and had sole custody, was forced to go to court with her daughter and reveal immediately before the abortion where she was trying to be completely supportive... reveal before a state court judge that well, she had to divorce her husband for abuse, which her daughter didn't know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.958" offset="4892008">So that she had... she had her choice of notifying an abusive ex-husband, going to a state court judge and letting this information come out before her daughter, who was pregnant and who she was just taking to the clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.484" offset="4938088">This is not a real choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.786" offset="4947283">But more importantly, this is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.319" offset="4961390">This does not achieve anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.322" offset="4969435">Even an immature minor, if they have the loving support of one parent, there's no reason for the state to impose such a draconian requirement that the district court found imposed burdens on real families, on real people, that not only interfered with communication, but impaired the health of young people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.618" offset="5326581">But there's no definition of emancipation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.200" offset="5336926">In fact, the case law in Minnesota says it's a question for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.933" offset="5351868">Well, of course, the only way to get a declaration would be to bring your parents into court, which makes it an impossible exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.070" offset="5384469">Because this is a criminal statute, the clinics are very reluctant to look at a minor's situation, and say, I'm guessing that you're emancipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.445" offset="5417905">So emancipated minors, in effect, have to go through court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.456" offset="5433997">Many minors who have children go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.827" offset="5443505">There have been married minors going to court, and minors living completely separated from their parents going to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.921" offset="5467852">Moreover, this statute says well, abused minors, victims of incest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.758" offset="5491153">If they've reported this and they're past victims, they don't have to notify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.829" offset="5507453">But it turns out that the reporting statute in Minnesota requires that after it's reported to the welfare department, the welfare department has to do an assessment and tell the parents about the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.478" offset="5558026">This could all be done in a time frame even before the abortion occurs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.915" offset="5971806">But first of all, this statute is written in a completely different way than any statute previously before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.730" offset="6011094">Although the Massachusetts statute in Bellotti, which did look at a consent statute which talked about two-parent consent, there was an exception in that for fathers, let's say, who had deserted the family and, moreover, there was an exception in that in the opinion itself in which you spoke of at least when the minor is living at home with two parents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.379" offset="6549634">The primary issue in this case is whether a state can require a reasonably diligent effort to notify the parents of an unemancipated minor 48 hours prior to the performance of an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.126" offset="6600625">Also before the Court is the question of whether the substitute version of the law, in effect for over five years with the court bypass, is constitutional.</text>

            <label>Mr. John R. Tunheim</label>
            <text syncTime="1631.479" offset="6670111">The... the law provides, Mr. Chief Justice, that parental notification is required in all cases 48 hours prior to performance of an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.686" offset="6714937">But in the... in the event that that provision is even enjoined by a court, then the substitute provision of the law would go into effect which provides a judicial bypass alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.775" offset="6763212">Now, decisions of this Court in five cases involving laws construing parental involvement in minors' abortions have established two clear principles... that for immature and non-best interest minors, states may require parental notice and even consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.286" offset="6849311">For mature and best interest minors, states may condition abortions on parental consent or judicial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.764" offset="6883166">Now, with respect to Minnesota law, certainly the Minnesota notice bypass law is constitutional if the Court finds that the bypass adheres to the Bellotti standards, and certainly the notice law is constitutional as applied to immature and non-best interest minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.215" offset="6957040">Unresolved is the issue whether the notice law is constitutional as to minors who claim to be mature or who claim that their best interests are served by having an abortion without parental notification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.612" offset="7006568">Now, although I intend to direct my argument to the notice law, I'd like to address briefly several of Petitioners' claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.270" offset="7049200">The Petitioners are asking this court to overturn decisions in Matheson, Bellotti II and Ashcroft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.596" offset="7082532">They're asking this Court to significantly limit parents' rights and responsibilities by finding that minors have constitutional privacy rights as against their parents and a right to withhold important information from parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.405" offset="7137808">Petitioners in effect are asking this court to second-guess a state legislature that has made a reasonable value judgment that it is beneficial for parents to know when minor daughters are pregnant and seeking an abortion, that parents can in effect be very helpful to minors during a time of serious trauma.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.039" offset="9180270">Factually, I think it's helpful to analyze the issue from the standpoint of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.083" offset="9204511">A consent requirement transfers ultimate control over the decision to the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.325" offset="9229484">Despite a minor's best wishes, no abortion is performed until the form is signed by the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.551" offset="9258323">It grants a veto power to a parent, and a parent can exercise that veto power passively by simply ignoring a minor's request to even discuss the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.728" offset="9303045">Notice, on the other hand, retains the ultimate control in the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.351" offset="9321540">This law is directed at the process of ensuring an informed decision, and not the end result, like a consent law is directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.387" offset="9361664">The law merely postpones for a brief period of time in order to permit the parents to consult with minors, and even if a parent disagrees, the minor is the one that ultimately makes the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.407" offset="9413804">Now, I submit that this Court has not equated notice with consent in the parental involvement cases, and that is confirmed by a footnote in the Matheson case, which indicates the Court's view that in Bellotti II, the Court had not equated notice with consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.036" offset="9480260">I think indisputably, notice is a much less intrusive form of parental involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.641" offset="9506696">Danforth found that the veto is the constitutional problem with the parental involvement law, and the Minnesota law does not permit a parent to exercise that veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.079" offset="9552462">Now, with respect... let me return to the second parent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.041" offset="9572315">I submit that the legislature could reasonably insist that both parents be notified, and reasonably believe that a two-parent notice system would serve the significant state interests that are inherent in a parental notification law and maximize the benefits that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.890" offset="10687744">The district court, after all, determined that the notice bypass law was constitutional facially and as it was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.136" offset="10724733">It struck it down after looking at the two-parent requirement and the 48-hour waiting period requirement in isolation, in holding that that entire statute had to be struck down because of those two provisions, despite the fact that he was ruling on a statute that had a bypass in effect, which would enable minors to entirely avoid those two particular requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.010" offset="10808221">I submit that the record in this case shows absolutely no tangible threat to the health of the minor as a result of this law.</text>

Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any minor suffered abuse or obstruction as a result of this law, that any minor suffered any medical harm as a result of this law, that the minimal delays engendered by the statute caused any kind of statistically significant risk or that minors were forced into unwanted motherhood or second-trimester abortions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2767.007" offset="11212178">The district court found in... in finding of fact number 67, as a factual matter, that the state had not proved that the law serves state interest in fostering family communications and protecting pregnant minors; not that the law didn't serve its purposes, but the state had not proved that the law didn't serve its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.228" offset="11297024">I submit that this is not a factual finding, but a conclusion of law, or, at... at the very least, a mixed finding of law and fact that's due no deference by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.576" offset="11338402">And I submit that it is not the state's obligation to reprove the factual premises of strongly established constitutional law, especially in a case in which there is a summary judgment order which recognizes that this Court has concluded that such a law serves state purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.239" offset="11413112">In fact, the... the language out of the Bellotti II case leaves little doubt about the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.333" offset="12597504">There's also a... a... an emergency exception in the law which allows an abortion to take place where it is necessary to prevent the death of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.880" offset="12643688">If the Court somehow believes that... that notice is more burdensome to a mature and best-interest minor, I would point out that the legislature has exempted those with truly compelling needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.828" offset="12691440">Now, with respect briefly to the waiting period of 48 hours, there is a significant state interest in a reasonable waiting period following the notification.</text>
