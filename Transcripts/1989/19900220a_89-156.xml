            <text syncTime="9.772" offset="179810">Mr. Cohen.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter W. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="189214">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.093" offset="201022">The issue before the Court in this case is whether Congress in enacting the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 intended that a criminal convicted of welfare fraud and sentenced to pay restitution as a condition of probation in a state court can walk out of the state courthouse and into the federal courthouse to have the judge's criminal restitution order wiped out in a bankruptcy process.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.708" offset="299555">The facts of the case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.077" offset="308960">The defendants in September of 1986 entered guilty pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.945" offset="324424">They were sentenced to pay restitution in the amount of $4,145 at the rate of $208 per defendant per month payable to the county probation department.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.087" offset="373012">A period of months passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.372" offset="378132">They failed to pay and they then proceeded in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.942" offset="404463">The probation department of the county filed a previolation notice and subsequently held a hearing and then the bankruptcy court instituted an adversary proceeding at the instance of the Respondents and an order was entered discharging the state court restitution sentence as a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.122" offset="485129">That decision was reversed by the judge in the Eastern District based upon this Court's reasoning in Kelly v. Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.093" offset="517103">But the Third Circuit in a two-to-one decision reversed and the order of discharge stood, cert was granted by this Court to address the question of whether a restitution order is a debt that is dischargeable in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.154" offset="581260">It is Petitioners' position that Congress did not intend to void a lawful state court criminal sentence in any way through the bankruptcy process or in particular here through a Chapter 13 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.314" offset="637893">To have done so would have trampled on the principles of federalism in comity that this Court in 1971 in Younger v. Harris discussed so thoroughly where the Court recognized the fundamental policy in our system of government against federal interference with state criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.560" offset="722948">Further, the language of the Bankruptcy Code does not clearly spell out that criminal court orders of this nature are to be voided through discharge in a Chapter 13 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.285" offset="773835">Additionally, there was a string of pre-Code cases going back as far as the case of In re Moore in Kentucky Bankruptcy Court in 1901 where courts refused to discharge criminal restitution sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.497" offset="842693">That is very important under the test that the Supreme Court set forth in the Midlantic case and the Court said that if Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially-created concept, it makes that intent specific.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.866" offset="1160133">In the Ron Pair Enterprises case, this Court also said that we must look very carefully to its clear expression of congressional intent when there is a clear conflict with state and federal laws of great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.375" offset="1218230">Here the conflict is between the Bankruptcy Code and the criminal laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.897" offset="1252293">In Kelly v. Robinson, this Court said you must look to... one must look to the whole law.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.051" offset="1284894">And if we do that, we find no solid specific evidence of any congressional intent to change that pre-Code law to allow for discharge of criminal sentences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.082" offset="6676986">Your Honor, I think it depends whether the restitution order is an independent component of the criminal sentence or whether it's a condition of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.938" offset="6708437">In this case it was originally a condition of probation, but the probation has expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.224" offset="6725573">All that remains is the order to pay restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.841" offset="6736022">And if the criminal court were to try to compel payment of the restitution after discharge, I think that would be inappropriate under Section 524, under the statutory injunction against collecting discharged debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.118" offset="6793178">If there were still a condition of probation and the restitution had been discharged, then I think the answer would depend on state law, which is could the state court judge modify or revoke probation when the original conditions of probation have proved impossible or infeasible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.345" offset="8694057">Besides the definition of claim in Section 101, there are two other sections of the Code which treat restitution as a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.182" offset="8721433">One is 523(a)(7), which refers to debts that are fines, penalties, and forfeitures, which represents Congress' codification of the pre-Code judicial exception to dischargeability of criminal and civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.942" offset="8776499">Congress has now upheld that those exception... Congress has... excuse me... written the law in a way that preserves those exception to discharge in Chapter 7, Chapter 12, some Chapter 11 and some Chapter 13 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.750" offset="8827699">So the fact that they acted expressly to protect those debts in some cases but not others indicates that they did consider them debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.122" offset="8861136">And, as I said, that they incorporated those exceptions in 13 for some kinds of debts but not others, including fine, penalty and forfeiture, that also indicates that it was a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.746" offset="8903663">Another section of the code, which is 726, provides for distribution of the property of the estate in payment of fines, penalties, and forfeitures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.067" offset="8936995">The same phrase from 523(a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.669" offset="8943369">And also fines, penalties, and forfeitures was the title heading of a chapter in the crimes code at the time the Bankruptcy Code was enacted, which is another indication that Congress meant to include criminal penalties as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.827" offset="8987987">By providing for distribution on fines, penalties, and forfeitures, which wasn't the case under the Act... because these kinds of claims were not allowable, were not entitled to share in the distribution of the estate... Congress has shown it's intention that these are debts that should be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.157" offset="9069280">And there's very good reason for including them in distribution, because if they weren't included, the entire estate could be liquidated and distributed without any payment to the restitution victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.446" offset="9106478">And this, we submit, would not make any sense because in some cases that distribution might represent the victim's best chance of recovering any money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.440" offset="9886390">Chapter 13 is basically a new system for consumer debt and it's singular in its approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2461.907" offset="9988267">They suggest that Chapter 13 can be used as a vehicle for criminals to escape the consequences of their act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.734" offset="11823631">And also throughout the case what Petitioners have argued is that how Chapter 13 unduly interferes with state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.721" offset="11851529">But as I was explaining before, the... that... the fallacy of that argument is proved by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.159" offset="11881309">While the bankruptcy was pending, the state was free to file a motion to revoke probation, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.480" offset="11902625">There was not effort to restrain the state court from proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.182" offset="11917358">The Davenports voluntarily appeared there and testified on the issue, which was whether they had the ability to pay, whether they had violated probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.519" offset="11942749">The state court judge, completely unimpeded by the federal court, denied the motion to revoke probation, decided that the Davenports had done what they were suppose to have done under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.013" offset="11996770">Probation expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.465" offset="12006488">The state judge's power to rule is completely unaffected by the bankruptcy and in most cases, if the Third Circuit's ruling is... is affirmed, that is not going... the result is not going to affect the powers of state court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.022" offset="12056747">And the reason that there is no undue interference in state court proceedings is that the underlying goal of the 13 and the restitution is substantially similar, which is that the debtor pay the restitution order to the best of his ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.513" offset="12106693">That is what the Davenports intended to do through their bankruptcy and the state court judge found nothing to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.234" offset="12133652">In conclusion, what I want to emphasize is that treating restitution as a debt is consistent with the plain language of the code and with federal bankruptcy policy that a debtor deal with all his legal obligations in one form and that the creditors receive equal treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.695" offset="12195510">Congress has designed Chapter 13 in such a way that the legitimate rights of creditors are protected and they have the tools necessary to protect their interests if they choose to utilize them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.634" offset="12235216">Although Petitioners expressed fear of interference in state court proceedings, that fear is just not justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.871" offset="12260189">To the extent that there is any tension between the two court systems, that arises from the Bankruptcy Clause in the Constitution as implemented by the Code.</text>
