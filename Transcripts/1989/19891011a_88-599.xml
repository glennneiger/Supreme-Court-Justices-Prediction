            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1062.368" offset="4399558">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.627" offset="4452639">In our view, for three reasons, due process allows psychiatrists to make the baseline treatment decisions regarding the appropriate clinical treatment of the severely mentally ill with antipsychotic medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.842" offset="4505511">The three reasons are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.466" offset="4515960">First, for more than 35 years antipsychotic medication has been widely recognized by the psychiatric profession as an acceptable and sometimes the only effective treatment for the seriously mentally ill who are either dangerous, as is Respondent, or who are gravely disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.912" offset="4581788">Second, because antipsychotic medication is an appropriate treatment for some mentally ill prisoners, the questions that arise in each case involve quintessentially medical judgments about the appropriateness of a particular medication or a particular dosage for a specific prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.124" offset="4646572">And those judgments are more likely to be made far more accurately by a physician than they are by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.605" offset="4672485">Third, although we believe a prisoner has a liberty interest in refusing antipsychotic medication, we also submit that the state or federal government has a countervailing interest in assuring that third-parties who are in an institution are adequately protected from assault and in helping to restore to a person the ability to function.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.658" offset="4764750">But by hypothesis, we are dealing here with someone who has the capacity to deny consent from the standpoint of exercising his voluntary choice, do we not?</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.215" offset="4815009">Well, doesn't the case come up to us in the context where the man is deemed to be competent, in the lay sense, of deciding whether he wants this medication or not, and to assess the benefits and the disadvantages of not having the medication?</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.942" offset="4901840">Well, the competency standard that the Respondent has argued we believe is inappropriate for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.267" offset="4923156">First, as this case illustrates, a person can be competent and yet assaultive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.094" offset="4942487">A competency standard, therefore, if it were adopted by this Court, would not adequately protect third parties from assault because it's quite clear that Respondent is seriously mentally ill.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="1209.433" offset="4987836">But he is not so seriously mentally ill that if he were a lay person he could be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.681" offset="5004867">Correct?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1214.103" offset="5006539">--I think... no... under a lay standard, because he would be found to be mentally ill and a danger to others, he could be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.631" offset="5040603">I think that's the standard this Court adopted in O'Connor v. Donaldson, and it would allow a person who is mentally ill and, therefore... and a danger to others... not simply mentally ill but mentally ill and a danger to others... to be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.485" offset="5092012">There are people... the second reason why an incompetency standard I think is inappropriate is that competency can be cyclical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.794" offset="5121269">A person can alternate between states in which he is competent and which he is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.777" offset="5137256">And, therefore, he would alternate between instances in which he could be treated and in which he couldn't be treated even if the medication were necessary to render him competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.757" offset="5173096">What could happen in that circumstance is a person would continually spiral towards a worsening medical condition and continuously be treated on an emergency basis as the condition deteriorated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.051" offset="5210294">And third, a legal... as competency is a legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.221" offset="5230983">It is not necessarily coincident, therefore, with the need to treat someone who is gravely disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.531" offset="5252195">For example, a person can be very, very severely depressed... so depressed that in a prison setting he could be seen to be easy prey by other inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.356" offset="5291587">That person, at the same time, however, may be able to decide whether or not he is willing to accept certain types of treatments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.040" offset="5326278">In that context, it is necessary in some cases to treat that person to avoid him from being assaulted by other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.709" offset="5356998">That's not the situation here because Respondent himself was responsible for assaulting other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.331" offset="5375388">But that type of situation can arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.814" offset="5385419">Now, Justice O'Connor asked can restraints be used, perhaps on a person like Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.936" offset="5409870">Restraints are only a short-term measure for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.998" offset="5426066">First, a person who is under restraint can oftentimes injure himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.277" offset="5443202">He can injure nerves or muscles by fighting at the restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.839" offset="5453442">He can become dehydrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.244" offset="5459085">He could have a heart attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.619" offset="5464623">Secondly, restraints don't treat the underlying mental illness that is the cause of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.008" offset="5482177">Someone like Respondent also suffers from episodic and cyclical episodes of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.051" offset="5506314">For example, some of the evidence in some of the biweekly reports that were conducted at the SOC indicated that they believed that there was a two to four month pattern of violence that Respondent seemed to indicate, although it was... there was an overlapping episodic series of violent assaults that could occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.186" offset="5566814">In that sort of circumstance, it would be impossible to predict when in a particular instance a violent out... outburst might occur and a restraint, therefore, would be an ineffective means of preventing that sort of circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.666" offset="5620730">So restraints, however, I might add, are the type of consideration that a physician or psychiatrist should be required to consider under the professional judgment standard that this Court adopted in the Youngberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.925" offset="5673811">That standard would require a physician to decide amongst the acceptable medical treatments by considering a variety of factors such as the prisoner's past history, his current mental status, his responsiveness to other types of drugs or medication, the risk type and severity of side effects that could occur, and the prospects of gain from using a particular treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.541" offset="5764299">A court can then intervene in a particular case after the fact just to ensure that a physician exercised his professional judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.491" offset="5800035">It is not our view that the court should be taken out of this altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.474" offset="5812051">It's our view that psychiatrists should serve as the baseline decision-makers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1559.883" offset="6389671">And we think someone who is gravely disabled and therefore who is in need of medical treatment for his illness is also a person who can be treated, because, as my colleague pointed out, in some cases the only alternative is a lifetime of institutionalization for someone who is severely mentally ill, whether or not he is dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.658" offset="6464799">If he has regressed so far that no other treatment is effective, antipsychotic medication is an appropriate means of helping to restore that person to a sufficient level of functioning so that he can ultimately leave an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.950" offset="6517880">Or, even if he cannot, then he can function within that institution at a... at an acceptable level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.338" offset="6539509">The competency standard that Respondent has urged does little, we think, to help serve both of those goals, for the reasons that I explained before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.739" offset="6581096">It does nothing to help prevent the risk of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.754" offset="6597083">It does not overlap at all with the situation in which a person may need this type of treatment in order to receive the care that is necessary in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.829" offset="6633445">And it is not one that we think is best applied in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.951" offset="6653925">If the Court has no further questions, I have nothing further to add.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brian Reed Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1634.728" offset="6689034">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.649" offset="6700737">I want to begin by emphasizing the nature of the of the liberty interests at issue here, and in doing so, I want to make a couple of points first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.896" offset="6737726">Mr. Harper has never been determined to be incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.567" offset="6752355">Mr. Harper has never been determined by a court to require treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.330" offset="6771476">That is, to suffer from a mental disorder and to be gravely disabled or a danger to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.687" offset="6788822">And that is the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.296" offset="6795300">Counsel for the Petitioner and for the U.S. government keep talking about treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.700" offset="6816929">If they are going to treat Mr. Harper, then it seems to me that, one, he is presumed to be a competent person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.181" offset="6846814">A competent person has the right to refuse treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.087" offset="6858412">The doctrine of informed consent implies that a person will be adequately informed and will voluntarily consent to treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.285" offset="6895297">And that, in fact, is the... is... we seek to protect that relationship between the doctor and the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.111" offset="6926539">But part of that relationship is the patient saying I don't want the treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.313" offset="6939391">So, it seems to me it's very important in deciding this case to make a very strong distinction to understand what we're talking about between the parens patriae power of the state and the police power of the state, those two interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.963" offset="6998010">They are very different and they have different implications for the resolution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.226" offset="7019013">I disagree with counsel when he indicates that the SOC policy says that it must be... the treatment... the involuntary treatment with antipsychotic drugs must be for treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.926" offset="7057778">I don't think it says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.863" offset="7061540">It says that one can only be medicated if he suffers from a mental disorder and as a result of that is gravely disabled or presents a likelihood of harm to himself or to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.812" offset="7101351">So, Mr. Harper is not seeking treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.405" offset="7115770">He is seeking, as a competent adult... presumed to be and no judicial findings that he is not... to refuse treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.965" offset="7438017">And I would submit that the parens patriae power of the state does not extend to a competent prisoner the ability of the state to force treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.101" offset="7474484">Now, the police power, that's a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.038" offset="7490262">And I think when we look at the police power interest in this case, I don't think that the police power interest is sufficient to justify the long-term involuntary treatment with antipsychotic medications that was at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.297" offset="7547313">There are, as your Honor has pointed out, other alternatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.171" offset="7566748">Isolation is another alternative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1862.215" offset="7598931">Well, that gets back into the parens patriae part of this equation because once the state decides that it's going to help its prisoner, then you're on the parens patriae side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.569" offset="7644384">If they're going to control the prisoner so... to maintain institutional calm and security, of course the state has the right to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.821" offset="8249380">No problem, because the side-effects aren't so serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.976" offset="8262023">You need to take antipsychotic medications where you run the risk of suffering from... and Mr. Harper did suffer from... dystonia and akathisia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.420" offset="8343839">And Mr. Harper was on these drugs for a very significant period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.958" offset="14153994">First, in response to Justice Steven's question about the number of prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.159" offset="14170712">As of the date of trial, there were 25, I believe it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.048" offset="14186281">As of the date of the Washington Supreme Court decision, there were nine, and today there are seven who have been through the hearings required by the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.452" offset="14219927">That's out of the 144 prisoners at the Special Offender Center and 6,000 inmates throughout the Washington Department of Corrections system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.102" offset="14270500">Has the judge usually said, go ahead and give the drugs, or has he--</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.068" offset="14294428">And the other point in response to the questions Justice White had about Vitek, it's true that the decision there speaks in terms of mandatory behavior modification, but it's our understanding based upon one of the amicus briefs that Respondent submitted, that treatment with antipsychotic medications was contemplated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.559" offset="14388365">And there is an indication in the trial court memorandum decision which is published.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.449" offset="14403934">There is a footnote, I believe, that speaks to that as well, your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.957" offset="14465896">Well, I think they may arguably... and if it does involve medication, it may arguably involve different kinds of considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.595" offset="14492541">But the point remains that the purpose in Vitek was transfer for a treatment, and what we're dealing with here is treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.000" offset="14518141">And that brings me to the third point I wanted to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.171" offset="14526814">Counsel suggested that the SOC policy was not geared to treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.262" offset="14543114">The SOC policy requires that the medications be prescribed by a psychiatrist or in an emergency somebody with prescriptive authority and confirmed by a psychiatrist within 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.398" offset="14595672">And under Washington law, prescribing medications for a non-therapeutic purpose would be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.256" offset="14623153">The final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.159" offset="14630781">Since this is a medication decision, a treatment decision, and a due process analysis, the question is what process is most likely to result in the correct decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.078" offset="14670383">And we submit that having a judge make the decision after a full hearing which necessarily involves at a minimum delay and in some instances appropriate medical judgment denied, that that does not meet the test of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.009" offset="14738196">That the medical model implemented in this SOC policy is more appropriate under the due process analysis.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3653.819" offset="14765364">Mr. Williams, what about just having a judge make the decision which the judge makes for civil commitment, not that... on the details of medical treatment, but at least a judicial decision that the person is a danger to himself or others?</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.765" offset="14821161">That the person is either incompetent or is a danger to himself or others?</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.686" offset="14836835">That has been the traditional necessary judicial judgment before you can get civil commitment, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.997" offset="14858151">Now, would you object to that?</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="3678.855" offset="14865569">Well, I guess the response to that is what value does that add to the decision-making process to have a judge make that decision when the result, if he makes a negative decision even though medical professional judgment indicates that the person does constitute because of his medical condition a threat to himself or others... if one of the outcomes is that the judge is going to in effect overturn that decision, what you have is a judge interfering with the professional medical judgment which this court has said persons in custody are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.310" offset="14999316">I think that the judge doesn't add anything, and it... and it increases the risk that an erroneous decision not to provide treatment will be made.</text>
