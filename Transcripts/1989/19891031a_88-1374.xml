            <text syncTime="11.710" offset="187691">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.712" offset="199708">In Walz v. Tax Commission this Court observed that the hazards of churches supporting government are hardly less in their potential than the hazards of government supporting churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.809" offset="240041">The circumstances of this case bear out the Court's warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.312" offset="254042">The tax in this case is imposed directly on the most central and protected of activities by religious organizations, namely the dissemination of religious doctrine and worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.440" offset="302630">At issue are sermons that have been preached from the pulpit and then presented both in printed form and in the form of tapes, religious books, such as the Life-Changing Prayer Manual, bible study aids, religious tracts, religious music, both instrumental and choral, and various bibles prepared for specific purposes by the ministries for the use of its... of its adherents.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.687" offset="403567">California is the first state to assert the authority to tax materials of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.812" offset="428122">Since the 1930s and '40s, when sales and use taxes came into widespread use, these specifically religious activities and transactions have consistently been held to be immune from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.521" offset="478904">Now, in part this is because of the decisions of this Court and the trilogy of cases in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, Jones v. Onelika, and Follett v. McCormick, which held that the dissemination of religious materials by itinerant and other evangelists for the purpose of communicating their message is exempt even from generally applicable taxes on other commercial vendors.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.910" offset="592485">That is right, Mr. Chief Justice, but the point of the decisions is that that flat license tax in the context of individual itinerant evangelists amounted to a very serious burden on their ability to communicate the message.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.761" offset="647864">It's our position, Mr. Chief Justice, that the tax in this case, although not flat, is similarly a serious, substantial burden on the... on the communication of the materials under the circumstances today, not--</text>

            <text syncTime="178.369" offset="854336">The point is that the transaction, the dissemination of religious materials, is itself burdened, discouraged, inhibited by this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.166" offset="885474">And you may say that 6 percent is not a lot--</text>

            <text syncTime="205.219" offset="961752">But, in addition to that, the very... the aspect of this tax that makes it particularly troubling to religious organizations is not so much the 6 percent, or 6.5 or 7... remember there are three different rates in California, but the... but the almost impossible administrative difficulty of dealing with the varying and changing rates of tax in some 7,000 taxing jurisdictions around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.369" offset="1074287">And the record in this case shows that the difficulty of dealing with that kind of a burden is something that only the largest ministries could possibly deal with.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.358" offset="1226216">And the only difference in that case, as I understand it, is that the seller was not an itinerant or non-itinerant preacher, but was, as far as the facts of the case were involved, a regular bookstore.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.576" offset="1479081">The principle here is that the government must leave religious organizations alone insofar as they are engaged in the dissemination of religious materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.803" offset="1676044">I don't know how, ultimately, a property tax would come out if the state or local government were to... were to abolish the exemptions that have existed throughout our constitutional history, but this Court in Follett, and in... and in Murdock, indicated that there might well be a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.776" offset="1747933">And several lower courts have held in the context of personal, not real, property taxes that there is a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.790" offset="1771966">And if I might inform the Court of the distinction that those courts have found, there, the principle is... is that property is not itself a religious act, that the Free Exercise Clause is concerned with the exercise of religion, that is, the actual transmission of religious doctrine and the worship of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.355" offset="1862245">Property... the ownership of property that might be used in the course of that is one step removed.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.553" offset="2058999">The two sides of this transaction are on the one hand the ministries, which is trying to communicate the gospel as it understands it, and at the same time to try to defray the cost of doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.463" offset="2110722">And on the other hand, the receiver is both engaged in receiving the message and also in supporting the conveyance of this message to further believers at the same time.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.646" offset="2187417">As this Court quite clearly held in Murdock, the fact that money changes hands in the course of the transaction does not transform this religious practice, which is of millennia, literally millennia old, into a purely commercial transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.615" offset="6671283">So the evidence is that, with respect to their internal records, they have segregated sales of tangible personal property from donations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.525" offset="6722901">The response is, the procedure that the organization followed was that it was charged to a donation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.408" offset="6742441">So in the situation where they were not clear as to what amount was being given for tangible personal property, they charge it to donation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2562.541" offset="10391016">And I think that is the point this Court has emphasized in dealing with states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.214" offset="10405644">That it doesn't want to start getting into the province of what state legislatures should or should not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.031" offset="10720994">I frankly find it, you know... maybe you do have agents who walk into the vestibules of churches and check out how many of these things are being sold.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.737" offset="10751819">With respect to that specific example, from my own personal information, being a Roman Catholic, is usually what is said in the vestibule of the church is the literature is there for the taking, whether you leave something or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.226" offset="10805736">And in a situation like that, where the intent, again getting back to your question regarding isn't it the intent of the parties that sort of determine a quid pro quo and so forth, the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.664" offset="10847531">The intent of the church in that situation is to let someone come in and freely take that pamphlet or brochure, whatever, irrespective of whether there is a transfer of money or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.599" offset="10883267">In that situation, most likely, it is not a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.743" offset="10899776">The church is probably a consumer of that property and Swaggart has concede that when you buy property that you should pay tax on it to the wine maker, or to whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.240" offset="10945752">So in the situation I think you are referring to, Your Honor, is that it is probably not sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.464" offset="10970725">Swaggart's primary administrative burden arguments relate to determining what price items are sold for, and complying with a potential 7,000 jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.453" offset="11014611">Both arguments are overstated and contradicted by the evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.835" offset="11032165">Taking the last point first, California and Baton Rouge are the only ones taking Swaggart's sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.769" offset="11055884">So this risk is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.799" offset="11064034">And if it ever developed, there is evidence that Swaggart's computer system could be programmed to handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.724" offset="11083678">Swaggart's other concern regarding donations versus sales is likewise overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.656" offset="11103427">Swaggart was able to ascertain sales amounts for the period in question, and even though his records were not set up for said purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.752" offset="11131848">Certainly for the future the evidence indicates that Swaggart can design an adequate system to comply for reporting purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.886" offset="11156403">He can design forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.190" offset="11165598">Organizations deal with this problem for internal revenue service purposes, as recognized in Hernandez.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.583" offset="11187123">This Court recognized in Breard that the fact that periodicals were sold did not put them beyond the protection of the First Amendment, but the selling, however, brought into the transaction a commercial feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.779" offset="11239995">This does not mean that religious organizations are to be treated as commercial businesses, but only that when a religious organization seeks to raise funds by selling tangible personal property, it may become subject to non-discriminating general revenue-raising statutes such as the California sales and use tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.632" offset="11311362">Swaggart also contends that another administrative burden in complying with the sales and use tax laws would be entanglement, caused allegedly through intrusive monitoring, on-site investigations, audits, allegedly all touching on religious matters of significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.014" offset="11384922">The record clearly doesn't support this and neither does common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.717" offset="11399656">In fact, there would be more of a risk of improper entanglement if an exemption based solely on religious grounds is mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.763" offset="11427868">The briefs of this case reflect a debate of what is and isn't religious, and what is and isn't core.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.454" offset="11450647">Swaggart has conceded that tax is due on t-shirts, mugs, pens and other items that it says</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.711" offset="11483665">"do not have specific religious message content. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.835" offset="11500175">Should courts be burdened with lawsuits to determine what items are core or contain religious message content.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.250" offset="11525879">Would symbolic items qualify: instrumental music, bumper stickers, making such determinations would clearly involve entanglement concerns under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.398" offset="11566421">If the Board is compelled to grant exemptions based on religious content, then the potential for discrimination against religious... religions, could exist due to administrative decisions as to what is or isn't religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.426" offset="11618562">This potential for discrimination has been disfavored by this Court, especially when exercised on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.920" offset="11648550">My next point is that the Board's position is not inconsistent with Murdock and Follett, as asserted by Swaggart in his reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.646" offset="11683450">It is correct the Board does not rely on the privilege analysis undertaken by this Court in Murdock, because it was effectively overruled by this Court in Complete Auto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.203" offset="11721589">As a proper analysis, it is based upon the nature of the tax rather than its label.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.898" offset="11740397">Contrary to Swaggart's assertion in his reply brief, the Board distinguishes Murdock based upon the difference between all the facts in that case from those present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.836" offset="11784178">Murdock involved a special occupation tax, a flat tax, payable in advance, unrelated to receipts or income of the solicitor, and imposes a condition to solicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.053" offset="11829004">It was a prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.445" offset="11838617">None of these facts exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.046" offset="11848962">As this Court observed in its footnote 9 in Minneapolis Star, a generally applicable sales tax is distinguishable from the taxes in Murdock and Follett.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.922" offset="11884488">Justice Brennan in Texas Monthly observed that the sales tax there was equal to a small fraction of the value of each sale, and in view of its generality, could not be viewed as an attempt to curtail religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.011" offset="11936838">My final point concerns exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.794" offset="11960034">Swaggart asserts that it was not required to exhaust administrative remedies regarding Nexus because the California courts did not always follow said rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.779" offset="11991904">Swaggart misstates California law on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.022" offset="12004965">Sales and use tax matters, this Court, in Richfield Oil Corporation v. State Board of Equalization, a 1946 case, recognized the jurisdictional procedural requirement for filing a claim and setting forth the grounds in said claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.471" offset="12058673">The court of appeals analysis in Swaggart below clearly states California law on the issue of exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.694" offset="12087616">California sales and use tax law achieves a religious neutrality in its application because sales of tangible personal property are subject to tax, irrespective of the contents or who is selling or who is buying that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.416" offset="12150519">Swaggart is using the Free Exercise Clause as a sword to claim an exemption that it does not mandate, and that California would otherwise be prohibited to give a religious organization under the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.127" offset="12213318">I think it is interesting in this case that Swaggart concedes that the individual that goes to a bookstore has to pay tax, to a commercial bookstore, or I guess now even a nonprofit bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.514" offset="12266921">But its only concerns are whether Swaggart is involved in the transaction or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.771" offset="12295864">I think that is a line that just doesn't seem reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.632" offset="12315404">These... as pointed out by one of the judges, when someone reads a book or buys a book, is he not doing it for basically the same purpose when he is buying it from Swaggart?</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.289" offset="12358036">Initially in their brief they started out with a proposition that religious organizations are exempt from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.166" offset="12389487">Then throughout their brief they sort of moved away from that position and narrowed it down to only when they sell religious material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.419" offset="12414460">Initially they started this case saying because they had less funds that was a burden, but they concede that by paying other secular taxes on other types of materials that they use they have less funds--</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.533" offset="12546953">Just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.775" offset="12551969">It is interesting to hear my friend talk about California's commitment to no exemptions from its sales tax, and how long this practice has been in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.392" offset="12594392">I have here the Sales and Use Tax Law, Chapter 4 Exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.898" offset="12616439">There is a page and a half of them, beginning with gas, electricity and water, gold monetized bullions, vessels, ice, bottled water, bracelets commemorating American prisoners of war and, most importantly, newspapers and periodicals, the value of which in total is many times the value of religious materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.004" offset="12704838">The state is evidently engaged in riddling its tax code with exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.420" offset="12726467">It is just not interested in the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.585" offset="12747156">However, there is also the problem that perhaps this is a new-found proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.588" offset="12771189">My friend says that this practice of the state of taxing religious articles goes back to the '30s or the '40s, but, as we have cited in our brief, the... an official opinion of the state attorney general issued in 1980 which flatly contradicts that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.371" offset="12838271">Now, I gather that there is some difference of opinion between the Board of Equalization and the state attorney general, but at least his opinion, upon which we relied during the tax period, would seem to stand as some kind of an authoritative statement of the state's position on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.445" offset="12914653">I might add that after the administrative proceeding in this case, a different appellant court and a different division in California, and the Institute for Basic Youth Conflicts, also held that as a constitutional matter California could not impose a sales tax on religious organizations disseminating religious material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.710" offset="12995633">So this is not such a long-standing practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.323" offset="13010157">The final observation I would like to make is that I don't want the Court to forget, just because it hasn't been a subject of the argument today, that there is the second problem of the chilling effect on an out-of-state ministry of the way California calculates Nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.351" offset="13102212">Because under the Commerce and Due Process Clauses, California would not be able to require a ministry located in Louisiana to pay any of this tax at all, but for the fact that the ministries conducts occasional worship services, evangelistic crusades within the state--</text>
