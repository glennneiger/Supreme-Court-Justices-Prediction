            <text syncTime="29.401" offset="253193">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.683" offset="266359">This case involves a challenge by the Petitioner to a judgment of the district court in the northern district of Ohio, which was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit, dismissing a two-count complaint brought by the Petitioner against this labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.143" offset="332187">The first count was for breach of duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.607" offset="345980">The second count was brought under the Landrum-Griffin Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.588" offset="357892">The district court dismissed the case on a motion for summary judgment and dismissed it on jurisdictional grounds inasmuch as because the case involved allegations that the Petitioner was discriminatorily refused job referrals on an out-of-work list, that the case was... preempted by the National Labor Relations Board exclusive jurisdiction under San Diego Building Trades v. Garmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.397" offset="469173">The district court also held the Landrum-Griffin Act was preempted similarly under the Garmon doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.901" offset="499162">The Sixth Circuit affirmed on the jurisdictional basis and additionally added that, because the out-of-work list was available to use by members of the union and non-members, it could not constitute discipline under Teamsters v. Leu, because non-members also could use the out-of-work list.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.068" offset="599890">This was an issue which was not reached by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.391" offset="613160">The duty of fair representation, we believe, is certainly involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.583" offset="637924">The duty developed over 40 years ago in response to a need by the individual members of the union to have redress for arbitrary union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.424" offset="693304">In Vaca v. Sipes in 1987, this Court also embraced the duty of fair representation again, subsequent to the National Labor Relations Board recognition of the duty of fair representation as an unfair labor practice in Miranda Fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.306" offset="764775">The duty of fair representation is a bulwark for redress by individual union members for arbitrary union conduct, and we believe that, because there is a congressional grant of exclusive representation authority to the individual labor unions, that the constitutionality of this grant would be called into question if the individual employee, the individual member of the union, were deprived of the right to a judicial forum to redress arbitrary conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.759" offset="906672">Thus, we see no reason to restrict the availability of the duty of fair representation, and any remedy for redress of discriminatory job referrals in this context ought to be... the jurisdiction ought to be concurrent with that of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.256" offset="1252638">The case involved allegations that the Petitioner was soliciting pencils which were actually campaign literature, and therefore these were protected... this activity was protected by Section 101(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="292.305" offset="1304778">And Section 609 of Landrum-Griffin applies to discipline for engaging in protected activities.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="1258.235" stopTime="1719.644">
            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="1258.235" offset="5168498">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.682" offset="5222310">In the brief time available to us, I would like to focus on count 1 of the complaint, in which the Petitioner alleges that the union breached its duty of fair representation to the Petitioner by arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refer him to employment through the union hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.481" offset="5325546">The courts below held that this claim fell within the exclusive primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, and for that reason, the count had to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.457" offset="5377373">We contend, with Petitioner, that that decision was in error for essentially three interrelated reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.263" offset="5412690">First, the duty of fair representation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.998" offset="5431603">The duty of the exclusive representative to behave fairly in representing all members of the bargaining unit is a duty that is of fundamental importance in the administration of the federal labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.688" offset="5494297">Second, this Court has recognized in a number of cases that the federal courts have served and need to continue to serve as primary guardians of that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.577" offset="5549885">And finally, there is no basis in the law or in sound policy for any exception for this particular case from the judicial enforceability of the duty of fair representation, either because the case involves a hiring [inaudible] or for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.170" offset="5636298">First, with respect to the fundamental importance of the duty of fair representation, it's true that that duty is not expressed in explicit terms in either the Railway Labor Act or the National Labor Relations Act, but this Court has said that the duty is implied in the strongest possible sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.597" offset="5730026">It is implied, this Court said in the Emporium case, from the very nature of the union's right of exclusive representation when it is chosen by a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.334" offset="5780912">Or, as this Court said in the Foust case, it is inseparable from that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.439" offset="5805363">The reason for that, we think, is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.890" offset="5815185">When these statutes, the Railway Labor Act and the NLRA, were enacted they operated to take away from minorities and from the individual the ability they previously had to bargain for themselves with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.793" offset="5886760">From now on a union that was chosen by the majority had the exclusive right to bargain for all the employees in the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.778" offset="5922705">If the employees themselves were not left with some relative duty imposed on the union, serious questions of fairness would be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.741" offset="5970561">And indeed, since the union's authority was conferred by Congress, those questions might rise to issues of equal protection or due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.977" offset="6007446">It's partly for that reason, we believe, that this Court has recognized, the Czosek case is a very good example, that the federal courts are the primary guardians of... of this very important duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.639" offset="6070140">For one thing, the duty itself was first recognized by this Court in the Steele case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.963" offset="6103472">It has been continued to be developed, refined, articulated by this Court and by the lower federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.200" offset="6136386">Secondly, as this Court said in Vaca against Sipes, the enforceability of this basic duty should not be left to the unreviewable discretion of the general counsel of the Labor Board, and indeed should not turn on the Labor Board's decision, which it is wholly authorized to make in the allocation of its resources, not to exercise its jurisdiction below a certain monetary threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.048" offset="6255818">The mere fact that an employee may be working in a business that does not meet that particular monetary threshold should not be that he is deprived of the ability to enforce his right of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.670" offset="6314228">Moreover, and I think this goes perhaps to a question asked earlier by Justice O'Connor, the scope of the duty of fair representation, protecting as it does against all arbitrary treatment in the employment relationship, may well be broader than the ability of the Board to enforce certain obligations that are created by the unfair labor practice provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.559" offset="6433869">The union has argued very forcefully in its brief for the proposition that some forms of arbitrary treatment do not fall under the unfair labor practice provisions of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.668" offset="6482248">The Labor Board, of course, disagrees with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.251" offset="6496563">The government disagrees with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.772" offset="6506698">But if it's correct it strengthens the position we are taking here, because the effect of it would be to leave essentially unenforced the guides of arbitrary treatment that may fall outside the particular scope of the Labor Board's responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.664" offset="6586215">Despite the union's contention in this case, we do not read the National Labor Relations Act, the Taft-Hartley amendments of 1947, which created new union unfair labor practices, as in any sense authorizing or licensing unions to engage in broader forms of arbitrary discrimination of the kind that this Court so vigorously condemned only three years earlier in the Steele case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.465" offset="6709409">That, then, leaves the question, we believe, whether there can or should be some exception to this general availability of a judicial forum for this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.034" offset="6767714">We believe that there should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.558" offset="6781820">In the first place, the enforceability of this duty is not limited to cases in which the plaintiff is also bringing a 301 claim for breach of contract against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.525" offset="6837722">This Court has made that clear in a number of cases, starting as early as Lockridge, almost 20 years ago, and as recently as Communications Workers, only two years ago, that the duty of fair representation extends beyond the hybrid action to cases involving the negotiation, the administration of collective agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.444" offset="6945346">And, indeed, in Lockridge the Court pointed out that the duty need not be bottomed on a collective agreement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.261" offset="6976589">Nor do we believe that there is any justification for excepting hiring hall cases from the scope of enforcement of this duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.083" offset="7303955">I believe that may well be true, if he can make out all the elements that are necessary to recovery on count 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.529" offset="7341676">Then that, I think, probably fairly embraces the claim that is made under count 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.724" offset="7374486">The... the converse is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.367" offset="7385040">He may be able to sustain his claim under count 1, but not under count 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.839" offset="7406982">As I was saying, I don't believe there is any basis for an exception simply because this case involves a hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.866" offset="7443031">In the first place, many claims of breach of duty of fair representation that involve hiring halls are accompanied by claims that there has been a breach of contract under 301; they are hybrid claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.194" offset="7500396">This case involves a hybrid claim in another sense, that is that the claim for breach of duty is coupled with a very closely related claim under the LMRDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.593" offset="7549924">Finally, it would be strange indeed to say to an employee you may pursue a fair representation claim with respect to matters of promotion, transfer, even discharge, but not with the basic right of employment through a union hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.836" offset="7630904">Union hiring halls serve very valuable functions in the administration of the employment system in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.192" offset="7660370">But they are capable of very substantial abuse.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence E. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="1890.538" offset="7697778">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.223" offset="7724527">I wish to proceed undaunted by Justice Scalia's statement to talk about the duty of fair representation claim and to seek to convince the Court that that claim, as the lower courts have stated, is... is badly founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.900" offset="7843227">I think that it is most helpful to begin by noting what Congress has done with regard to hiring halls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.253" offset="7908638">This is not a subject as to... which has escaped legislative attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.376" offset="7937059">And no matter how this case comes out, and no matter what the duty of fair representation is determined to encompass, individuals like Mr. Breininger who claim, at least in the second breath, that they have been harmed in job opportunities, either because they are non-members or because they are 8(b)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.725" offset="8114483">And that's no mere happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.857" offset="8127022">The most contentious issue, in 1947 when Congress was considering a question of how unions which are parties to collective bargaining relationships should be regulated, was the subject of the closed shop, the requirement that to be hired you had to be a union member, and most particularly, the closed shop in connection with the hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.851" offset="8271009">That debate was of the dimension of the debate we are having today over the scope of the capital gains tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.069" offset="8327851">It was an issue that was fought out in public and not in private, that gripped the national attention, that caused rallies, vetoes and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.690" offset="8382395">And Congress came to a conclusion on... on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.375" offset="8413115">And the conclusion was that where unions have an active role in the hiring process they should be subject to the same norms as employers, same NLRA norms as employers who are engaged in the hiring process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.717" offset="8494408">And as the language of Section 8(b)(2) makes plain, that is the gravamen of the 8(b)(2) offense, and Congress was operating against the background of well settled law that an employer in making a hiring decision violated the NLRA if and only if he acted on the basis of the union considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.148" offset="8616138">It seems to us that the essence of the matter in terms of what the statute tells us in terms is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.511" offset="8697640">That if an employer and a union bargain in a way which ends up in the employer doing the hiring, under the NLRA there is a violation if and only if the employer refuses hire on the basis of union considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.086" offset="8791890">And if the employer and the union bargain in a way which provides that an outside agency, a third party, an employment agency, makes the hiring decision, the same rule obtains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.797" offset="8854793">The argument here is that if the employer and the union bargain and the determination is made that the union will have an active role in the hiring process, there is a different standard, as Justice Stevens indicated, that the standard would be the one drawn from the duty of fair representation and would be... would stretch beyond alleged wrongs based on union consideration to claims that the union didn't have specific... sufficiently specific rules, which would not be a violation for the employer, that the union had rules which it didn't follow, to the detriment of people who were union members and were close to the administration, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.807" offset="13266770">What is water over the dam, as far as we are concerned, is that there is a duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.693" offset="13302401">And that it applies in situations in which the union is acting in a way that no employer does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.671" offset="13338241">But there is no case, and therefore no water and no dam, that states what the limit of the duty of fair representation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.780" offset="13394666">And we're arguing that this ought to be a limit, that when you look at the whole statute which you are elaborating through a process of implication, that it is a mistake to... to define the duty of fair representation so broadly that it duplicates the particular coverage that Congress intended with regard to the regulation of hiring decisions under the NLRA, and indeed overpowers the rule that Congress, after the most contentious debate, arrived at with regard to when a hiring decision is a violation of Title VII as opposed to... I mean, of the National Labor Relations Act as opposed to a violation of some other claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.254" offset="13680654">What is at issue here is both the proper tribunal for determining the validity of NLRA hiring decisions, which, overwhelmingly before this late-blooming theory, have been handled by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.739" offset="14002587">The complaint... let me just say something very quickly about the structure of the Landrum-Griffin Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.555" offset="14037800">The Landrum-Griffin Act has a provision, Section 101(a)(2), which safeguards member free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.792" offset="14074790">It has another provision in Section 101(a)(5) which prevents discipline without due process, or the imposition of union penalties without due process, hearing and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.522" offset="14133722">Section 102 gives individuals a cause of action for a breach of either 101(a)(2), the free speech provision, or 101(a)(5), and Section 609, as this Court said in Finnegan v. Leu, which has been referred to here, in essence replicates, and for the purposes of this case, is parallel to Section 102.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.060" offset="14251795">The only claim made in the complaint, the only question raised in the petition for certiorari, concerns Section 101(a)(5), the due process provision, and Section 609.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.402" offset="14325147">There is no reference to Section 101(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.856" offset="14339044">It was never raised; it's not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.757" offset="14350643">And this Court quite clearly held, in Finnegan v. Leu, that retaliatory actions that affect a union members rights or status as a member of the union are all that is covered by Section 101(a)(5) and Section 609.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.032" offset="14447714">So we think the lower court was plainly correct on this Court's precedence with regard to the Landrum-Griffin claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.461" offset="14501422">To say that a job referral out of a non exclusive hiring hall is an incident of membership, when the union can't limit the use of the hiring hall only to members, and doesn't purport to, is no more sensible than to say that discharge from a union position, an appointed union position, is discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.036" offset="14643737">And the Court squarely, of course, has rejected the latter of those two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.890" offset="14671113">I want to say something, too, about the practicalities of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.031" offset="14687727">What really is affected here is whether you have to go through a due process system in administering a hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.001" offset="14739554">The theory of the Petitioner in this case is that any union decision, A is referred rather than B, is a form of discipline to B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.202" offset="14804442">And therefore, that you have to serve a charge on B for not having worked as long as A, or for any other claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.119" offset="14848014">I want to make it plain that nothing we ask this Court to say or do implicates the question of whether somebody who pleads 101(a)(2) states and says that one of the ways that the union retaliated against him for exercising free speech is job related, doesn't have a good claim... cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.988" offset="14975492">That is just not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.930" offset="14983329">That's a question for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.812" offset="14990852">It was never pled; it was never litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.664" offset="15002241">So, in sum, we say that insofar as the Petitioner here claims that the union acted against him based on the fact that he was a NLRA--</text>
