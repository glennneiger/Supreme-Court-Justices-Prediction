            <text syncTime="90.224" offset="498023">At that two-day hearing, five separate experts were called who testified in child-specific detail as to their recommendations and their opinions as to whether the children would be able to testify in the presence of the defendant, or whether they would be better able to testify out of the presence of the defendant, by way of our procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.235" offset="6942118">Bad trauma would come if the child had been abused and the defendant were guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.555" offset="6963434">Good trauma would come if the defendant were innocent and the child were prevaricating, fantasizing or being coached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.799" offset="7124348">It is too much of a price to pay that what my brother concedes is the most important part of the fact-finding process, face-to-face confrontation, be stripped away on the theoretical possibility (a) that a child could not testify, and (b) on the undemonstrated fact that that is so.</text>
