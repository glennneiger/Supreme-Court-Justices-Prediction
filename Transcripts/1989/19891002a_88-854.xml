            <text syncTime="1879.477" offset="7663343">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.038" offset="7677658">Not long before this lawsuit in Yonkers was filed, Justice Lewis Powell, writing in dissent in the Columbus, Ohio School Desegregation case, issued a warning to federal judges across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.780" offset="7752577">He warned that in cases involving the elimination of racial discrimination, of eradicating racial discrimination roots and branch, that federal judges would confront situations in which local elected authorities would seek to abdicate their responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.787" offset="7840558">They would welcome judicial activism, Justice Powell's words, rather than face up to the politically difficult and sensitive task of remedying discrimination, of upholding the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.060" offset="7921746">In this case, Judge Sand, affirmed by an able and unanimous court of appeals, presided over the liability phase of these proceedings and then the equitable remedial proceedings with great patience, as the court of appeals expressly stated, with great courage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.941" offset="8021220">In the face of the most difficult and daunting and at times threatening circumstances, the judge never flinched from doing his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.637" offset="8075973">But he also refused to permit the elected authorities of Yonkers from doing their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.571" offset="8107738">He refused specifically, even though he considered it, he refused to establish himself as the housing czar of Yonkers by creating an affordable housing commission, which he considered, but which the city objected to, the city council members objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.249" offset="8202406">He thought the better of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.280" offset="8210556">He also declined to deem legislation passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.949" offset="8237305">He had indeed in the past taken certain steps with respect to deeming certain acts to be done, the Rule 70 approach, which--</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.081" offset="8325808">There are two aspects of the remedy, it is important for the Court, as I am sure it appreciates, to bear that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.797" offset="8352662">The first part of the remedy, public housing, is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.108" offset="8373873">With respect to that, the judge has, indeed, from time to time deemed specific steps to have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.339" offset="8402817">But he said in this instance, involving affordable housing, this is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.665" offset="8424133">This is such an important and pivotal piece of legislation that I am not going to deem the legislation passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.083" offset="8461749">I invite the Court's attention to the colloquy that is set forth at page 357 of the Joint Appendix, where Judge Sand said I have a sense of what my powers are, but also what is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.685" offset="8528205">If I knew I never had to come back to the city council for any further action, then I might very well be willing to deem the legislation passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.259" offset="8574494">I believe I do have that in my power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.258" offset="8586510">But I know, given the political structure of Yonkers, that I will have to come back to them, and thus I want to consider stripping them entirely of their authority by creating the Affordable Housing Commission, reporting to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.329" offset="8654742">It was that that the United States objected to, that the city council members objected to and that the city objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.668" offset="8696120">On what grounds?</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.496" offset="8699464">The grounds was, do not strip us of the power that we enjoy under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.947" offset="8733214">And he declined to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.180" offset="8742200">He thought the better of it, and he said I am, therefore, going to simply hold the city to its obligations.</text>
