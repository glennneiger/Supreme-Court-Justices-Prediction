            <text syncTime="34.904" offset="276153">This case calls upon this Court to interpret the reach of a criminal statute, the restitution provision of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of VWPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.045" offset="320666">In this case, the Petitioner was charged with offenses of embezzlement of mail and fraudulent use of credit cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.385" offset="353998">Pursuant to a plea agreement which was silent as to restitution, he entered a plea of guilty to count 4 only of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.006" offset="392555">Count 4 of the indictment charged that on or about October 18, 1985 he fraudulently used a credit card issued by MBank to one Hershey Godfrey and thereby caused losses aggregating more than $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.885" offset="464026">In the interim, between his plea of guilty and the sentencing hearing, he received notice from the probation service of the court that it was proposing a restitution order far in excess of losses on the count of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.312" offset="525779">He filed a timely written objection to that notice, pursuant to local procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.716" offset="547409">At the sentencing hearing information presented was that the total losses on the Godfrey credit card, which was the subject of the count of conviction, was about $10,000, speaking in round numbers, and the issuing bank, MBank, suffered overall losses of about $90,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.712" offset="631314">Over the Petitioner's renewed objection that such a restitution order would exceed both the limits of the law, and his ability to pay, the court sentenced him to pay $90,000 in restitution within five years after expiration of an eight-year term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.341" offset="701845">Now, in this case we turn first, as we expect the Court will, to the plain language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.488" offset="1114475">The one that governs this case is set out on appendix page A-1, the same page I was reading from; (b)(1) governs property loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.213" offset="1153345">It provides that in the case of an offense resulting in loss of property of a victim of the offense, the order may require that such defendant return the property to the owner of the property or pay the value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.740" offset="1219487">Now, because they is simply nothing to suggest that the meaning of the term 3579(b)(1) authorizes the court to order return of the property taken in the offense, and does not authorize anything more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.069" offset="1304751">Now, the government relies in large measure on Section 3580(a), reproduced at appendix pages A-4 and A-5 in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.127" offset="1353025">We rely on it also because we believe that it supports our reading of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.345" offset="1373923">It says that the court shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.184" offset="1405270">Here again, with nothing to indicate that the offense means anything different from what it meant back in 3579.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.956" offset="1436304">Now, the government would argue that the catchall language at the end of 3580(a) must mean that the court has authority to order restitution beyond the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.300" offset="1493668">What this section does is say that the court shall consider loss sustained by the victim as a result of the offense, certain factors bearing on the defendant's ability to pay and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.940" offset="1548212">I think I should respond to this because the government places considerable reliance on that catchall phrase in 3588 expanding the plain language of 3579.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.765" offset="1599517">I would note, first, that 3580 is a procedural section.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.621" offset="1630968">It is so titled, it's called Procedure for Issuing Order of Restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.675" offset="1651239">Its content is largely procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.893" offset="1664091">By its terms, I believe it applies only after the court has decided that restitution is already covered under Section 3579, the section that is more substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.267" offset="1709544">It says page A-4),</text>
            <text syncTime="396.219" offset="1721352">"the court, in determining whether the order restitution under Section 3579 of this title, and the amount of such restitution. "</text>
            <text syncTime="404.658" offset="1755102">I believe this means that unless the court has already determined that restitution is covered under Section 3579, then the court does not reach 3580(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="417.066" offset="1804735">Now, I think it's also significant that the government is asking a general catchall phrase to expand other specific provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.874" offset="1856039">We say that 3579(b)... (b)(1) property loss, is very specific in authorizing the remedy in the case of an offense resulting in loss of property, to return that property or pay its value.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.569" offset="1918733">And it simply cannot be the duty that the government would assign to it of expanding a specific provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.243" offset="2177450">And because it so clearly refers to that, it cannot support the government's meaning of expanding authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.509" offset="3570508">In addition, this is not a statutory factor, but an obvious factor, is that in a multi-defendant case I can certainly imagine the court considering how to apportion restitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="901.438" offset="3742289">This is a case where we suggest that the unambiguous language of the statute limits restitution to the offense of conviction and the Court should so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.878" offset="3780010">Now, if the Court should find some ambiguity, then it would be proper to resort to customary rules of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.234" offset="3817417">Turning first to the legislative history, I believe that the Court will find an extraordinarily explicit record that directly supports the petitioner's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.057" offset="3864751">At the same time, this record does not contain any suggestion to support Respondent's expansive reading of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.147" offset="3897143">The first thing that we would look at is H.R. 6915 in the 96th Congress, 1980, a progenitor or forerunner of the 1982 VWPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.573" offset="3954821">We've reproduced the pertinent parts in our reply brief at appendix pages 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.561" offset="3982720">It will be seen that Section 3331 was the analog or forerunner of our substantive Section 3579, a defendant who has found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to make restitution to a victim of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.355" offset="4045936">And 3332, nature of a sentence, is the analog of 3579(b)(1), which gives the covered loss and remedy in the property loss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.830" offset="4091807">A defendant may be sentenced in the case of an offense resulting in loss of property, to return such property or pay its value.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.067" offset="4124722">Now, Congress used that type of language in 1980, and what is perhaps more important is what Congress understood that that language meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.042" offset="4164637">In the accompanying committee report, also reproduced in our reply brief, appendix page 9, Congress said of that section,</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.042" offset="4272679">The relevance that I see, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the language is functionally identical to what Congress ultimately passed in 1982 in the VWPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.815" offset="4311758">And this shows Congress' understanding of what that language would accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.285" offset="4333597">And the record shows nothing that... to show that Congress changed course in that two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.872" offset="4360033">When Congress enacted the VWPA in 1982, there was a significant expansion from existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.044" offset="4392633">And that is it freed the restitution order from conditions of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.032" offset="4416666">And Congress used very express language when it when it did that in 3579.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.417" offset="4438191">So the court may order restitution in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.738" offset="4463477">And at the same time in the Senate Judiciary Committee report accompanying that, it explained what it had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.510" offset="4490540">It said Section 3579(a) expands current law by authorizing an order of restitution independent of a condition of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.682" offset="4523246">Nowhere did it say that they expanded current law by permitting restitution beyond the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.169" offset="4553130">In that report, the Senate report accompanying the VWPA when it was enacted, shows that Congress was fully aware that the existing Federal Probation Act limited restitution to the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.029" offset="4616659">The report quoted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.131" offset="4621048">But nowhere in the section of the Senate report problems of current law, or anywhere in that report, did the committee say that it is a problem of this law that it limits it to the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.205" offset="4673293">And I would suggest that it is simply inconceivable that Congress would bring about so major a change in the Federal Criminal Law, as Respondent urges, without accounting for it in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.965" offset="4728359">The next item in the history we believe is significant is the 1986 Amendment of Section 3579.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.804" offset="4763677">In that year as part of a technical amendments bill, Congress amended 3579(a)(1) in one respect so that the last phrase read instead of restitution to any victim of the offense, it said any victim of such offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.914" offset="4828147">And the accompanying report said that the purpose of the amendment was to clarify that any victim of such offense referred back to the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.455" offset="4866286">And as well, that report cited to an earlier report, a year earlier, that said explicitly that the VWPA limited restitution to the offense of conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.941" offset="5200235">We believe that the meaning is the same in 1982 and 1986, and under either version the result needs to be the same in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.231" offset="5237433">The only significance would be the weight to be given to the legislative history of the 1986 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.385" offset="5262093">So, to... to recap briefly this legislative history, for the better part of this century, since the Federal Probation Act of 1925, Congress had said that restitution is limited to the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.645" offset="5323115">The forerunner, a progenitor of this law in 1980, Congress said that functionally identical language to what was eventually passed would so limit restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.470" offset="5374419">When Congress passed the VWPA, it said we have expanded restitution beyond conditions of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.908" offset="5404095">It did not say we have expanded restitution beyond the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.427" offset="5422171">And, finally Congress amended this law in 1986 to make it abundantly clear that the offense means the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.050" offset="5456653">I believe that where the legislative intent is so plainly expressed, and especially where it is consistent with the plain language of the statute, the petitioner's right to relief is... is clear.</text>

I certainly agree with that, Justice Stevens, because the statute contemplates that there are certain covered losses that are not going to be part of the indictment, such as therapy of a victim, such as lost income in the case of bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.877" offset="5619971">And I think some of the court's went astray and seeing that necessarily they were going to have to look outside the indictment to find some of the covered losses that induced them to look further outside the indictment, further than what the language would bear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.257" offset="5817561">But if any of this analysis should leave any residual ambiguity at this point, then I would refer to the fact that this is a criminal statute, and we're not here to find out what happened to the limitation that the old Federal Probation Act had, but... but to look at this statute and see what does it expressly authorize, because when we are speaking of criminal penalties for criminal offenses it is a question of what has the Congress expressly authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.911" offset="5956114">Where the court of appeals found an ambiguity in this language it erred by interpreting the statute expansively against the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.612" offset="6174916">--The question presented in this case is whether under the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 a defendant who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense may be sentenced to pay restitution for damage caused by acts for which he has not been found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.609" offset="6250984">The answer, we submit, is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.442" offset="6262269">The Victim and Witness Protection, the VWPA, which authorizes a court to order restitution to any victim of the offense of which a defendant is convicted, mandates full and fair restitution to that victim, restitution that reflects a realistic assessment of the harm to the victim caused by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.824" offset="6351817">Thus, as virtually every lower court to consider the question has held the amount of restitution the defendant may be ordered to pay is not limited to the particular loss from the narrow count of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.817" offset="6407719">If the courts were limited to considering only that loss, full and fair restitution to victims of crime would often be impossible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.260" offset="6773538">First, starting with 3580(a) and (d) which Petitioner basically relies on in his opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.116" offset="6808960">3580(a) we see has a two-part structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.353" offset="6833933">It first says, the court in determining whether to order restitution shall... and the amount of such restitution... shall consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.911" offset="6884193">And then it goes on to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.612" offset="6894955">"and such other factors as the courts deem appropriate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.481" offset="6906449">Now, the first part of that section speaks in mandatory terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.349" offset="6921913">It tells the sentencing court what it shall consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.635" offset="6935079">And it specifies the amount of loss resulting from the... the offense, which we maintain is only part of what... which are only some of the acts the court can consider... can consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.811" offset="6991713">It's appropriate that in speaking in mandatory terms the provision alludes specifically to the loss resulting from the offense because that is going to form the centerpiece of the vast majority of restitution orders, if only because there will always be an offense of conviction, and most of the time it's the offense of conviction which will cause the harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.415" offset="10422113">And that means that there... there should be some linkage, some relationship, between the conduct of the defendant that's taken into account, the related conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.694" offset="10603298">And to understand that, one needs to look at the purposes of restitution and the nature of restitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.468" offset="11786331">First of all, it's true that we could attempt to elicit a promise from the defendant that they pay comprehensive restitution flowing from all the counts that we think they are guilty of in the process of hammering out a plea agreement on a very narrow count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.049" offset="11872744">We could... the prosecutor could try and get that promise out of the... the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.270" offset="11905554">And this case illustrates why that promise is so odious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.207" offset="11929378">This individual has 13 years to pay restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.695" offset="11947246">If he willfully reneges on his promise to pay restitution at year 10, we do not think that the prosecutor has a realistic prospect of reviving the charges that he's relinquished as part of the deal and making them stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.222" offset="12017358">The fact is that victims will suffer, and defendants will go scot free.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.410" offset="12042122">Well, Ms. Wax, this looks a case where the government entered into a very poor plea agreement from the standpoint of public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.899" offset="12076082">And I would think a prosecutor would want to be a little careful before entering into such a limited agreement with someone who has caused so much harm or been privy to much broader activity than that encompassed in the plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.092" offset="12140865">Now, I guess you would agree that the prosecutor doesn't have to accept a limited plea bargain like this or go along with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.331" offset="12181825">But... and we... we don't actually think that, as these matters go, the prosecutor did anything out of the ordinary or anything that, you know, he shouldn't have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.741" offset="12239504">I mean, this individual was sentenced to eight years in jail on the basis of the plea to this single count.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.004" offset="12324558">But he did receive a substantial jail term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.106" offset="12332917">But that's just the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.689" offset="12339291">The... the prosecutor got a plea bargain which involved a substantial jail term, which more or less comports with our view of the kind of penalty that an individual should get for pilfering $90,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.366" offset="12401985">But in doing so, he had to sacrifice a tremendous amount of restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.137" offset="12433019">He basically had to go down to 1/100th of the value of what this person took from the bank, which we think is virtually as good as no restitution at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.129" offset="12485055">And this will happen over and over again, we think, if this Court embraces Petitioner's view of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.753" offset="12523507">It will... it will impale prosecutors on the horns of a dilemma, it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.555" offset="12542733">The question will be should, you know, should I accept this plea bargain which necessarily involves convicting the person on fewer counts than he was indicted on, or even that we think could prove, and thereby sacrifice the interest of victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.202" offset="12617339">And we don't think... we think Congress was aware of prosecutorial practice and we don't think that Congress wanted that kind of sacrifice of victims' interests where again and again in the statute, in the legislative history, it emphasized that full and fair restitution to victims was its goal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lucien B. Campbell</label>
            <text syncTime="3207.441" offset="12966230">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.576" offset="12982844">First I'd like to suggest the petitioner's interpretation would in no way eviscerate the Victim and Witness Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.082" offset="13016803">Apart from the government's considerable power to insist on full restitution where appropriate as part of a plea agreement, the statute involved in this case, credit card fraud, specifically permits aggregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.572" offset="13070824">Not only of amounts, but of credit cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.674" offset="13083154">And, in fact, count 6 of the indictment that appears in the Joint Appendix, page 5 and 6, one of the dismissed counts, aggregated not only amounts but two different credit cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.284" offset="13133623">If the government in this case had considered it so important to obtain a conviction that would support an order of full restitution under the VWPA, it could have insisted on a plea of guilty to a count aggregating all of these losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.544" offset="13194645">The other half of the government's argument other that the catchall phrase in 3580(a), seems to be general legislative purposes... that is, to restore victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.370" offset="13250024">Congress did have that goal within the limits of the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.255" offset="13269564">But at the same time, Congress had a very specific purpose to limit restitution to the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.075" offset="13296836">And this Court has repeated as recently as last month in the Crandon and Boeing case that general expressions of legislative purpose can rarely carry the burden of expanding a criminal statute beyond what is clearly warranted in the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.203" offset="13365277">I believe that Congress balanced competing interests when it passed the VWPA, it perpetuated the bright line of restitution limited to losses established by the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.278" offset="13417626">And that is a line that serves all of the interests well.</text>
