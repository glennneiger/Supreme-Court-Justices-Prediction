            <text syncTime="11.310" offset="182584">Mr. Isenstadt, you may proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="ernest_j_isenstadt" startTime="28.600" stopTime="222.837">
            <label>Mr. Ernest J. Isenstadt</label>
            <text syncTime="28.600" offset="251756">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="31.793" offset="264608">This case involves a group of competing private practice criminal defense attorneys who agreed among themselves to withhold their services from the District of Columbia until the District increased the price it paid for those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.281" offset="318525">The court of appeals held that the lawyers' boycott was the essence of price-fixing, and that the First Amendment does not immunize such price-fixing from antitrust review, even if it is used in an effort to induce the passage of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.229" offset="374322">I shall argue this morning that in these two respects, the court of appeals was clearly correct and its decision should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.264" offset="402430">Then, however, the court reversed course and held that the First Amendment requires the Commission to prove market power in order to condemn a price-fixing boycott that is used in part to express the views of the boycotters on a matter of public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.774" offset="468468">I shall argue that this novel exception to the Sherman Acts per se prohibition against naked price-fixing agreements is unsupported by law and would have serious effects for antitrust enforcement if left to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.276" offset="526460">A brief review of the facts demonstrates the correctness of the court of appeals' conclusion that the lawyers' boycott was the essence of price-fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.651" offset="560001">Prior to the boycott the District of Columbia government offered $30 per hour for court time and $20 per hour for out-of-court time to any attorney who volunteered to represent indigent defendants in Superior Court under the Criminal Justice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.340" offset="618724">No attorney was required to offer his services at that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.193" offset="638159">Attorneys who wished to do so competed for the city's legal business by calling in each morning and asking that their names be placed on a list from which counsel was assigned that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.491" offset="679328">And the record shows that, right up to the day before the boycott, enough attorneys volunteered at the rates offered by the city to provide counsel for all indigent defendants who required it.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.857" offset="724781">In an effort to obtain an increase in the CJA rate, the lawyers conducted a lobbying campaign in late 1982 and '83 with which no one takes issue, but when they grew dissatisfied with the pace and results of the city's legislative process, they met, on August 11, 1983, and agreed among themselves that if the rate increase were not forthcoming by September 6th they would collectively cease to accept new case assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.776" offset="832510">The boycott began as intended, and as the lawyers expected, it had a severe impact on the District of Columbia Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.281" offset="866469">The participants in the boycott comprise nearly all those who had at the time made a practice of accepting Criminal Justice Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.686" offset="900115">The few attorneys who showed up to accept cases during the boycott became quickly overloaded, prompting the head of the Public Defenders Service to write Mayor Barry on September 15 and advise him that the available attorney pool was no longer sufficient to continue to assure the appointment of counsel for all indigent defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.438" offset="979109">In response to that communication, the Mayor recommended and the city council enacted legislation increasing the CJA rate to $35 an hour for both in court and out-of-court time.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="229.571" offset="1055700">Suppose just three attorneys agreed that they would do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.413" offset="1067090">Would that be a boycott, subject to the per se rules?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ernest J. Isenstadt</label>
            <text syncTime="235.325" offset="1078688">Technically, Your Honor, if three attorneys agreed among themselves, of course any attorney in the exercise of his own individual judgment may refuse to accept case assignments, but if three attorneys agreed, that would be per se unlawful... agreed that they would not accept assignments until the price was increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.319" offset="1162698">That is not, of course, the situation that occurred here.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="260.652" offset="1180043">Well, the reason I ask it, because you do indicate that you had looked to the actual market effect of what occurred in order to prove that there was a boycott.</text>

          <turn speaker="ernest_j_isenstadt" startTime="270.438" stopTime="307.922">
            <label>Mr. Ernest J. Isenstadt</label>
            <text syncTime="270.438" offset="1219122">Your Honor, the Commission found both that the boycott was unlawful per se and under rule of reason analysis, and we think it was correct on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.705" offset="1264262">The... what is per se unlawful is an agreement among competitors as to the price at which they will deal, and that is true whether the competitors number only a few or number here more than a hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.615" offset="1323821">But, of course, one doesn't find typically that only two or three competitors in a market served by one hundred will make such an agreement, because it would have no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.072" offset="1361646">And that is not what happened here.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="307.922" offset="1369065">xxx boycott do you... you just have an agreement... we just won't work for any less than a certain amount?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ernest_j_isenstadt" startTime="318.380" stopTime="592.348">
            <label>Mr. Ernest J. Isenstadt</label>
            <text syncTime="318.380" offset="1410861">It's price-fixing boycott, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.040" offset="1417548">It was price-fixing that was implemented by means of a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.111" offset="1429878">And the court of appeals recognized that it was, as it said, the essence of price-fixing and a classic restraint of trade within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.648" offset="1463942">And this Court has never wavered in its recognition that naked price-fixing agreements are unlawful per se, without regard to whether the conspirators have market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.186" offset="1506156">The court of appeals also correctly recognized that there is no First Amendment immunity for such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.268" offset="1534473">The Noerr doctrine establishes that competitors may associate together for the purpose of attempting to persuade the legislature to enact legislation, and even though that legislation may itself result in fixing prices or restricting output, that does not convert the joint effort to achieve such legislation into a contract in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.664" offset="1620050">But the Noerr doctrine does not permit competitors to fix prices or restrict output themselves as a means of pressuring the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.019" offset="1653486">In the Noerr case, the only conduct involved was a joint publicity campaign: the railroads conspired to run advertisements.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.303" offset="1686610">And this Court recognized that they did not jointly give up their trade freedom or otherwise engage in boycotts, price-fixing or agreements traditionally condemned by Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.011" offset="1733421">The lawyers here did precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.893" offset="1744915">Although the court of appeals correctly recognized that there is no First Amendment immunity for the boycott in this case, it then reversed course and held that if the boycott were characterized as expression, and if one applied the test in United States v. O'Brien rather than the test in Noerr, that the boycott would be entitled to constitutional protection from application of the per se rule against naked price-fixing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.212" offset="1866228">We think the court's application of the O'Brien test in this situation was both incorrect and unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.669" offset="1896112">It was unnecessary because this Court, in the Noerr doctrine, has already balanced the rights of competitors to act in collusion to petition the legislature against the rights of the public to be protected from anti-competitive restraints of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.840" offset="1964762">And the balance struck in Noerr is that competitors may jointly lobby, but they may not jointly fix prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.884" offset="1988899">And to apply a further O'Brien test in this context basically subverts the test established by the Court in Noerr.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.376" offset="2014917">Even, however, if one does apply the O'Brien test here, it does not result in the conclusion that the Sherman Act is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.274" offset="2062460">The per se prohibition against naked price-fixing agreements proceeds from the recognition that such agreements are always... are almost always harmful to competition, and are never helpful to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.843" offset="2112719">And the O'Brien test does not prevent the government from enforcing categorical prohibitions against generally harmful conduct, merely because such conduct may not be harmful in particular instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.113" offset="2169875">As this Court said in United States v. Albertini, the First Amendment does not bar application of a neutral regulation that incidentally burden speech merely because a party contends that allowing an exception in the particular case will not threaten important government interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.694" offset="2236122">Put another way, the per se rule against price-fixing serves important values of business certainty and litigation efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.851" offset="2272797">And those in themselves are substantial governmental interests that the court is required to consider in conducting an O'Brien analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.746" offset="2308428">The court of appeals did not credit those interests here.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.257" offset="2322430">The Respondents maintain that it is inappropriate to apply the per se rule because of the assumption that underlies it, that naked price-fixing agreements are generally harmful, does not apply in the case of such agreements directed at legislative targets.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.698" offset="2384184">But I think that the facts of this case themselves demonstrate the validity of that assumption, even assuming the court felt it appropriate to reexamine it in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.046" offset="2433607">As I have said, the lawyers who engaged in this boycott comprised nearly all those who made a practice at the time of accepting Criminal Justice Act assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.872" offset="2468925">They expected the boycott to have a severe impact on the District's criminal justice system by depriving it of the attorneys it needed to operate, and the boycott had that effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.636" offset="2619913">--It said it was not sufficient to show that the boycott had harmful effects, such as threatening a shut down of the court system, because those effects might have resulted from the communicative impact of the boycott rather than its coercive impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.267" offset="2682502">And so therefore we must demonstrate that the CJA lawyers had market power so that we could, from that, infer that the actual demonstrated harmful effects were the result of such power rather than of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.917" offset="2745091">And we find this a rather baffling command, because, of course, the same objection could be raised in almost any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.184" offset="2794097">This Court has said that, even in a rule of reason case where the conduct is not per se unlawful, market power need not be shown precisely.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.520" offset="2891482">We... we did not challenge the lobbying effort that preceded the boycott, and the dividing line is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.964" offset="2909245">Nor do we challenge the communicative activities that were conducted at the same time as the boycott, such as contacts with the press and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.830" offset="2944667">We challenge only the collective refusal to supply services to the city at the price it was offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.475" offset="2967341">I think, for the reasons I have indicated, that under a rule of reason analysis properly conceived, the conduct here could properly be condemned, and the Commission so held in the alternative in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.266" offset="3026482">But I also cite these facts to demonstrate that there is no reason in this case to revisit the Sherman Act's... the validity of the Sherman Act's per se prohibition against naked price-fixing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.522" offset="3075488">Even when directed against legislatures, they are typically just as harmful as when directed against private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.677" offset="3104118">And we think it is important for the Court to reiterate the applicability of the per se rule in the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.003" offset="3133375">It is the oldest and clearest prohibition in the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.405" offset="3151034">We think if there is one thing that most business persons understand, or ought to understand, about their obligations under those laws, it is that they must decide for themselves, and not in concert with their competitors, whether they will deal and at what price they will deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.905" offset="3212997">And it is obedience to that command that ensures everyone the benefits of competition, and dilution of that command jeopardizes those benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.744" offset="3456353">But I think in this case, where the seller... the buyer, rather, posted the price, there is certainly no objection to the sellers getting together and agreeing on a lobbying price.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.967" offset="4077232">In 1974 Criminal Justice Act funds ran out in the District, and so it was essential then to implement a draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.862" offset="4108892">And the record shows that a large number of attorneys did not respond and the District bar commenced a lawsuit against the institution of the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.387" offset="4142956">That led the late Chief Judge Moultrie, who had been on the court at the time, to conclude that he did not wish to reimpose a draft under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.394" offset="4182975">This is not a case of just calling up one lawyer and asking them to come down for an important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.945" offset="4201157">This would have involved compelling hundreds of lawyers to accept the representation of thousands of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.693" offset="6132128">But in fact, the First Amendment contains not only the right to petition the government for address of grievances, but also the right to communicate to other people as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.648" offset="6271935">Why couldn't you make the same argument in every case where a group even... even goes after a private employer, or a private buyer of services?</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.886" offset="6452912">And so, I think it is not an argument that is available to everyone for every conduct in whatever context.</text>

            <text syncTime="2925.502" offset="11839361">After all, it is individuals, particularly the poor and disenfranchised, who are most likely to need to resort to conduct like a boycott.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.984" offset="12049281">And that is the only way that businessmen ever compete in the antitrust sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.777" offset="12068507">The city was not... the city depended on their competition to obtain the supply of lawyers that it required.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.717" offset="12420220">It recognized that this was a per se violation of the antitrust laws without regard to whether there was market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.239" offset="12446342">But it held that the First Amendment, as construed in O'Brien, made that law unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.115" offset="12481868">And our point is simply that the per se rule is based on the assumption that price-fixing is generally harmful, and the Constitution doesn't prohibit enforcement of a categorical ban upon generally harmful conduct merely because it is claimed that in a particular circumstance the harm is not being caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.190" offset="12562117">And the court of appeals, I think, disregarded that admonition in the way it construed O'Brien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.603" offset="12583851">I have no further questions.</text>
