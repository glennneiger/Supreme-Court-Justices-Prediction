            <text syncTime="16.443" offset="214521">The issue presented in this case asks whether a shipper who utilizes the services of a motor common carrier has a legal right to the benefit of an unfiled illegal rate, or must the shipper pay the carrier's lawful tariff rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.019" offset="268856">Quinn Freight Lines, one of the petitioners in this case, was a motor common carrier that conducted operations in interstate commerce pursuant to authority granted by the ICC and under tariffs on file with the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.010" offset="320787">The respondents are a shipper, Primary Steel, who utilized the services of Quinn, and the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.933" offset="352448">The facts in this case indicate that Primary and Quinn negotiated rates for the transportation of steel products from a point in Connecticut to destinations in 12 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.156" offset="401349">Notwithstanding the fact that Quinn did not file its rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission, transportation was performed over a period of nearly three years, and roughly 1,100 shipments were transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.898" offset="452340">Following the bankruptcy of Maislin and Quinn, it was discovered by the rate auditors who were retained by the estate of Maislin that the transportation charges assessed Quinn... assessed Primary by Quinn were in fact not on file in tariffs on file with the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.628" offset="527259">Now, the rate auditors made demand for payment of undercharges, that is the difference between the filed tariff rates and the unfiled rates that were assessed on the carrier's freight bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.352" offset="574175">Primary refused to pay the undercharges, and an action was instituted in the United States District Court in the District of Missouri, Kansas City specifically.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.481" offset="646691">First, whether Quinn's rates, applicable filed tariff rates that is, were in fact applicable to the shipments transported by Primary, or by Quinn on behalf of Primary; second, whether Quinn's rates were reasonable pursuant to standards established under the Interstate Commerce Act; and third, whether Quinn would be barred from the collection of its undercharges by virtue of two provisions contained in the Interstate Commerce Act: first, Section 10701, which relates to carrier practices, reasonable rates and so on, and secondly, the so-called Tariff Requirement Act, or provision of the act, which is Section 10761 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.808" offset="811994">In an advisory decision issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Commission ignored the applicability issue and the rate reasonableness issue, and instead decided that the carrier should be foreclosed from collecting its undercharges, based solely on the language of Section 10701 of the Act, which again is that provision which requires carriers' rates and practices to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.625" offset="923275">Following the advisory decision, the district court issued its decision in which it upheld the ICC advisory opinion, noting also that the negotiated rate proposition was an unreasonable practice and in fact foreclosed the carrier from collecting its undercharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.889" offset="1004255">The court also held that there was no provision contained in the Interstate Commerce Act which foreclosed the Commission from issuing a policy statement which in effect said that it would henceforth consider equitable defenses to carriers' efforts to collect lawful tariff charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.907" offset="6848369">First, a shipper negotiates a rate with a motor carrier, an event which happens hundreds and even thousands of times today... every day, under the competitive regime established by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.314" offset="6901973">Second, the carrier fails to file that rate in a tariff, as it is required to do by the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2093.039" offset="8520937">And similarly the Commission has found in negotiated rates that if the carrier has committed an unreasonable practice, which is defined by these elements that I have summarized, that the finding of an unreasonable practice should supersede the filed tariff rate and prevent full collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.681" offset="8575481">So, essentially, the carrier or its trustee in bankruptcy is... is asserting the right to collect an unreasonable charge, and there is no right that creditors of the bankrupt have to obtain the benefit of... of an illegal charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.357" offset="8634204">Again, let me stress that the, the statutory violations which admittedly have occurred here are duties which the statute imposes on the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.046" offset="8664924">They are not imposed on the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.731" offset="8671716">The carrier is essentially before this Court seek... seeking to obtain a windfall produced by its own statutory violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.568" offset="8698988">The shipper has engaged in no affirmative misconduct in these cases whatsoever, and in fact typically has no way to get these charges back, because they were passed on, to the extent that they were passed on to their... the shipper's customers years ago, and those transactions have long since been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.478" offset="8762622">The only real difficulty with the Commission's... the only two legal issues, I think, that need to be resolved in order to rule... to uphold the Commission's policy are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.120" offset="8805254">Petitioners have conceded that if this were an unreasonable rates case that the Commission's order finding an unreasonable rate would supersede the tariff rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.373" offset="8834198">So one issue that has to be decided is whether or not there is any difference under the statute between unreasonable rates and unreasonable practices, whether the statute draws a line between those two things, such that a finding of unreasonable practices does not supersede a tariff filing, whereas a finding of unreasonable rates would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.835" offset="8904101">And the second issue is whether or not the Commission has primary jurisdiction to consider unreasonable practice claims that are referred to it by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.543" offset="8942867">And I think the answer to both of those questions is that... is that the Commission's decision is fully justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.697" offset="8971497">The provision that carriers must engage in reasonable practices is found in the very same sections of the statute that say that the carrier must engage in... must charge reasonable rates, Section 10701(a) and Section 10704.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.372" offset="9034191">So the same statutory provisions govern both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.341" offset="9046103">In addition, this court has held on many occasions that when a claim of unreasonable practices is raised in the course of a judicial action, that that claim implicates the administrative discretion of the ICC and must be referred to the ICC for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.951" offset="9104513">It can't be decided by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.286" offset="9109842">So in terms of the primary jurisdiction jurisprudence, the court has drawn no distinction between unreasonable rates and unreasonable practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.940" offset="9136487">And for those reasons we think that the petitioners' suggestion that somehow, merely because the Commission is relying on its practices jurisprudence here rather than... or practices authority rather than its rates authority, that a different result ought to maintain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.699" offset="9199494">I think it is also important that what is involved here is the Commission's essentially attempting to reconcile two different provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.339" offset="9234080">You have Section 10761(a), which the petitioners rely on, which requires the carrier to file its rates and tariffs and collect only the tariff rates, but you also have the duty to engage, to maintain reasonable practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.232" offset="9285698">Commission... the petitioners' theory essentially is that the one section, the tariff filing section, completely... completely trumps the unreasonable rates practice, because neither the courts nor the Commission would have any authority whatsoever to grant relief to shippers in this type of circumstance presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.543" offset="9362916">They would be no way that they could obtain any type of damages or reparations for unreasonable practices that are in fact statutory violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.566" offset="9394995">But the Commission's determination here has essentially attempted to accommodate or reconcile these two statutory provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.576" offset="12227086">Well, one way... well, first of all, this proceeding is largely retrospective in orientation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.279" offset="12249865">The Commission was confronted with a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.998" offset="12260732">The problem was this avalanche of lawsuits filed in bankruptcy proceedings with carriers seeking to recover much... much higher rates than had been agreed to with shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.420" offset="12298453">And the Commission basically in these proceedings, these negotiated rates proceedings, is trying to figure out what is the best thing to do about that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.341" offset="12326142">And I think by telling the carrier that you can't gain a windfall, you can't somehow, after the fact obtain a huge increase in the rate that the shipper never agreed to, in fact helps to serve to dissuade carriers from engaging in this unreasonable practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.601" offset="12383194">I don't think there is any tension or inconsistency between a deterrence-type rationale and what the Commission is doing in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.823" offset="12412033">The Commission has not gone by special proceeding beyond this to focus on whether or not some other measures might be appropriate to try and encourage carriers to tow the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.562" offset="12447037">But at least insofar as what they have done here, I don't see any... any inconsistency between what they have done and those larger objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.805" offset="12507955">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.472" offset="12510671">it's a Commission finding of an unreasonable practice which supersedes the filed rate requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.828" offset="12540033">Let me briefly mention the second legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.745" offset="12547765">I have said the first legal issue really was whether or not the... a different rule should apply for unreasonable practices and unreasonable rates, and turn briefly to the primary jurisdiction issue, since it is featured in the petitioners' briefs and is an argument that can generate some confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.254" offset="12609728">The question here is whether, although, of course, the Commission has primary jurisdiction to consider an unreasonable rate referral from the Court, it has no primary jurisdiction to consider an unreasonable practices referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.680" offset="12659465">And I don't... we don't think that there is any basis for this either in the T.I.M.E. decision or anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.316" offset="12677959">Essentially the argument is that the unreasonable practice involved here falls into a crack in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.470" offset="12698648">The petitioners admit that is this were an unreasonable rate claim it would be expressly governed by the statute that Congress passed to overrule the T.I.M.E. decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.058" offset="12733026">And they admit that if this were an unreasonable practice of the sort that was involved in the Hewitt-Robins case, which was decided three years after T.I.M.E., it would also be subject to the Commission's primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.497" offset="12770746">But they say that this case falls into a crack between those two broad areas of the law, and therefore is not subject to primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.853" offset="12800108">The... the key assumption that they are making is that the rationale of the T.I.M.E. decision lives on, even though T.I.M.E. was overturned by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.793" offset="12835948">And that under the rationale of the T.I.M.E. decision there would be no basis to refer this issue to the Commission, because the rationale of the T.I.M.E. decision was that the Commission can't accept a case on referral where it doesn't have independent jurisdiction to grant relief on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.802" offset="12895925">And the short answer to that is that that particular rationale was expressly repudiated by this Court in the Hewitt-Robins case, which was decided three years after T.I.M.E. At page 89 of Hewitt-Robins the Court said this, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.062" offset="12956947">"The practice of the Commission in making such determination in the first place, even though it has no power to award reparations in a given case, has long been exercised and is supported by a long line of cases. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.786" offset="13003863">In short, this Court itself repudiated the rationale that the petitioners are relying upon shortly after the T.I.M.E.... case came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.076" offset="13045032">And for that reason alone, Commissioner's argument has no merit and should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.914" offset="13072408">If the Court has no further questions, I thank the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.818" offset="13096023">I do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.518" offset="13102815">I think it is well to look at the Hewitt-Robins case in light of the government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.039" offset="13120892">In fact, Hewitt-Robins involved a practice, the practice of routing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.191" offset="13141476">The carrier routed interstate shipments, or intrastate shipments over an interstate route, and thereby applied a higher rate than was applicable under its interstate, or intrastate route, the result being, and this is what this Court held, that that common law right to a reasonable route exists and was not extinguished by the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.456" offset="13230606">That's the kind of practice the Commission has traditionally looked at, and that is the kind of practice the Court has looked at in terms of what is a lawful proposition versus an unlawful proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.097" offset="13273133">We contend here, of course, that in fact the secret rate agreement is an unlawful proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.268" offset="13297793">The Commission and the courts have always wrestled with practices that revolve around tariff provisions, not around secret agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.690" offset="13331543">The government says that the culprit in this is the carrier, because the carrier failed to follow through on its duty to file a tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.213" offset="13369577">Well, in fact the law charges shippers with knowledge of tariff provisions as well, and Primary was no small shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.399" offset="13398312">The record indicates it shipped 43 million pounds via this carrier over a nearly three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.305" offset="13426002">So in fact the conduct that we are talking about was not unreasonable in terms of the carrier's practice solely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.643" offset="13455364">It was the shipper who neglected to even ask the carrier whether or not it had a tariff applicable to this movement, notwithstanding its allegations it knew nothing about the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.267" offset="13497786">The law requires this, but I know nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.969" offset="13508653">It made shipments to United States Steel, one of the largest producers in the country, obviously, and notwithstanding that United States Steel undoubtedly audits its freight bills, Primary says it didn't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.960" offset="13560585">So this whole process--</text>
