            <label>Mr. Theodore L. Garrett</label>
            <text syncTime="11.672" offset="188170">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.343" offset="202904">This case involves central issues concerning the adoption and the enforcement of state air control regulations under the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.781" offset="244595">The question presented is, in a case where a state has revised its regulations, whether EPA may bring a suit to enforce the original unrevised regulations and to collect penalties without first complying with its statutory duty to act to approve or disapprove the revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.349" offset="342920">We request that the decision below be reversed because it allows EPA to veto state regulatory choices through an enforcement mechanism without following the procedures and requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.025" offset="405614">We submit that this procedure EPA is following creates a regulatory limbo which frustrates the efforts of states and companies to respond to changing conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.785" offset="460680">Now, I want to clarify at the outset that our point is not simply that EPA took too long in acting on the revision in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.308" offset="506760">Our point is a more fundamental one than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.360" offset="518985">We submit that Congress established a very careful sequence in the statute, first, for the state promulgation of state implementation plans and revisions to those plans, secondly, for limited and timely EPA review of those plans and, only after that, for enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.691" offset="612295">We submit that by skipping that second step, the limited and timely review, EPA has put the cart before the horse, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.933" offset="653255">Now, in this case, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts gave General Motors an extension of time, from 1985 to 1987, 1987 being the attainment deadline in the Clean Air Act that's relevant here and, indeed, it was the deadline for all of Massachusetts, as granted by EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.631" offset="748027">The purpose of the extension was to allow General Motors to replace an older painting facility that it had in Framingham, Massachusetts and instead to build a new more modern facility with substantially lower emissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.474" offset="811452">EPA had previously approved similar extensions of time through state plan revisions for other companies in 1984 and 1985, and the Agency did so pursuant to a policy that it had announced in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.436" offset="875295">In this particular case, EPA waited while General Motors built its plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.673" offset="904239">It completed the new facility at great expense in July of 1987, and then when the new facility was built and the old facility was shut down, EPA filed a lawsuit in August of 1987 to collect penalties for the period of time during which the company had operated the old paint shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.853" offset="988980">It did so without taking any action... any final action on a revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.574" offset="1011864">Now, we submit that General Motors should have been entitled to comply with the Commonwealth's revision and should have not been penalized for doing so until EPA took action on the revision.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="231.083" offset="1065885">Well, Mr. Garrett, the statute, does it not, makes the terms of the original plan enforceable until a revision is approved, as I understand it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore L. Garrett</label>
            <text syncTime="248.728" offset="1136415">Are you referring to Section 110(d) of the statute, Your Honor?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore L. Garrett</label>

            <text syncTime="1784.461" offset="7279370">I would like to preface my remarks by pointing out that the time limitations that were specified in the Act in 1970 in order to get the states to make prompt submissions and EPA to move on them within four months were designed to get into place protections of the public health which were not yet in place under the previous versions of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.752" offset="7432552">And enforcement authority was included in the 1970 Act so that these protections of the public health of the breathing public would be in place and enforceable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.788" offset="9596641">Number three, the Petitioner is asking the courts to erect a bar to the exercise of the government's explicit enforcement authority even though no such bar appears in the text of the statute itself or is adverted to in any way in the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.403" offset="9695175">Nothing is pointed to that shows that it was at all contemplated by Congress in enacting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.259" offset="9726521">And at least the American Cyanamid court... and Petitioner hasn't totally renounced it... that court based this judicially created enforcement bar on EPA's failure to complete regulatory action on a proposed SIP revision within a four-month period supposedly required by the statute even though that alleged four-month requirement also does not appear in the text of the statute and is not adverted to in any way in the legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.484" offset="9883465">And my fifth point in this brief analysis is that Petitioner seeks to justify its proposed judicial building of inference on inference here to supersede the statutory text on the ground that otherwise the Act's overall policy of state and Federal cooperation will be distorted to the prejudice of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.571" offset="9999762">And yet Massachusetts, the state whose interests are involved here, joined by 12 other states, has filed a brief in this Court stating, for very cogent reasons... and I commend this brief to the Court's attention... that their interests are better served by the government's ability to enforce the Act according to its terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="3611.510" offset="14587596">Just a few brief points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.695" offset="14596268">In response to the last point concerning emergencies, it should be understood that our position is that EPA does have authority under a separate provision of the statute to deal with those, and we would not claim a bar to deal with those kinds of emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.204" offset="14650290">Our request for a bar only deals with state implementation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.942" offset="14673277">With respect to the commingling point and Mr. Wallace's comments about the government policy with respect to the negotiations of a DCO, the negotiations were simply that the government wanted GM to pay penalties as a price for getting the SIP revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.920" offset="14753212">They weren't asking GM to make any other improvements or do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.206" offset="14766378">They had just changed their policies on whether or not SIP revisions could be allowed for these purposes as a revision or whether a DCO with penalties was the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.996" offset="14809532">And I would urge the Court to look at the Hannish memo... it's a May 1986 memorandum by an EPA official that we've lodged with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.785" offset="14848611">It demonstrates the moving target problem in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.189" offset="14870241">Mr. Wallace said that the Cyanamid remedy, or the temporary bar on enforcement is an extreme remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.945" offset="14905245">Well, we would submit to the Court that the mandamus remedy, or the First Circuit's remedies, are much more intrusive and extreme than the remedy that we propose.</text>
