            <label>Mr. Arthur E. Wilmarth, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="26.733" offset="106893">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="30.102" offset="120372">This is an appeal by Gerald A. Lewis, Comptroller of the State of Florida and head of the Florida Department of Banking and Finance, from a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.041" offset="160078">This case arose out of an application filed by Appellee Continental Bank Corporation to establish a state chartered industrial savings bank, to which I will refer as an ISB, in Miami, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.765" offset="215040">The court of appeals struck down three Florida statutes which prohibited Continental from opening the proposed ISB based on the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.037" offset="252134">The court of appeals also granted attorneys fees on appeal to Continental, apparently based on 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983 and 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.910" offset="287556">Appellant Lewis maintains that the decision below should be reversed for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.964" offset="307827">First, this case has become moot by reason of a 1987 amendment to the Federal Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.868" offset="335412">Second, Section 664.02 of the Florida statutes, which prohibits the issuance of any further ISB charters to any person, represents a non-discriminatory exercise of Florida's authority over the chartering of local banking institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.013" offset="399987">The statute is therefore lawful under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.114" offset="412421">And, as the court of appeals found, the statute would thereby moot the case by precluding any relief to Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.101" offset="436349">Third, Continental's claims under the dormant Commerce Clause do not vindicate any right secured by the Constitution that is cognizable under 42 U.S.C. 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.743" offset="478877">Accordingly, Continental cannot recover attorneys fees under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.861" offset="495386">I will first, very briefly, touch on the mootness issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.413" offset="509597">It is undisputed, as shown by the briefs, that Continental cannot now open the ISB for which it applied, which was an FDIC insured ISB.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.603" offset="546377">In 1987 Congress amended the Bank Holding Company Act and expanded the definition of bank to include all FDIC insured institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.624" offset="582426">Continental is an Illinois bank holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.428" offset="597682">Under the Douglas Amendment, Continental cannot acquire a bank in Florida, unless Florida gives specific authorization for Illinois bank holding companies to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.249" offset="628924">Again, it is undisputed that Florida has not permitted Illinois bank holding companies to acquire banks in Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.945" offset="3879706">Is the statute discriminatory in its impact?</text>
            <text syncTime="971.964" offset="3887856">And, for the reasons I have suggested, this statute is not discriminatory in its impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.833" offset="3907291">It had an even-handed impact upon both in-state and out-of-state holding companies, because, apart from the Douglas Amendment, there would be no, there would be no argument of discriminatory treatment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.074" offset="3948251">The statute itself withdraws the option equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.109" offset="3960372">If I might then proceed at this time to the Section 1983 issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.013" offset="3983987">We take the position that both the plain language and the evident purposes of both the Commerce Clause and the 1983 establish that the claim of violation of the dormant Commerce Clause does not vindicate any right secured by the Constitution, which, of course, is the predicate for finding a Section 1983 remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.580" offset="4090253">Preliminarily I would say that we have also shown that, of course, 1983 fees would not be available here unless Continental actually obtained some meaningful relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.536" offset="4134139">And if you find the case to be moot, based upon the federal law change I have mentioned, or if you find it to be moot because Section 664.02 is valid and therefore prohibits the granting of the charter, then, in that case, Continental has obtained no relief here, and under the case such as Hewitt versus Helms and your Garland case last term, there would be no relief, and therefore no fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.586" offset="4234344">But going to the merits of the 1983 issue, the Commerce Clause itself does not guarantee or grant any rights to market participants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.885" offset="4755540">And really, in four cases this Court has said the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.270" offset="4772989">That in Clover Leaf, Exxon, and CTS, this Court has said that the Commerce Clause protects the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.091" offset="4796291">It does not protect particular participants in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.959" offset="4807784">That it protects the national interest in having economic uniformity and an absence of commercial hostility among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.363" offset="4837355">But it does not protect individual participants, because Congress, for example as in the Glass-Steagall Act, can entirely prohibit interstate commerce, or, as in the case of the Douglas Amendment, it can delegate to the states the opportunity to restrict interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.856" offset="4895347">So this is not a right of the same kind as the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.010" offset="4916036">I think it was put most strongly in the Metropolitan Life Insurance case, upon which Continental relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.164" offset="4940591">In that case Justice Powell said that the interstate... I am sorry, the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause perform different functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.709" offset="5006733">The clause itself is not a grant or guarantee of any constitutional right to engage in interstate commerce, and therefore it is important to draw a distinction between 1983, which says any right secured by the Constitution, and, for example, Section 1331, which says any right arising under the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.626" offset="9130423">In Clover Leaf Creamery, this Court said, in finding that there was no discriminatory intent, that it was going to rely on the statements of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.982" offset="9167830">And what we have here is a flat statement by the legislature that this statute was enacted for the purpose of depriving Continental of an effective means of gaining access to Florida deposits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2311.276" offset="9245048">There is a history here that goes back 17 years as to the motive of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.347" offset="9265319">In 1980, in the Lewis case, this Court held unconstitutional Florida's prohibitions against the acquisition of non-banking subsidiaries by out-of-state bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.238" offset="9312862">The Florida legislature, three weeks later, reenacted the statute, verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.559" offset="9334178">The acts of the Florida legislature here are nothing more than acts of defiance of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.880" offset="9359464">The legislature further, when we received a preliminary injunction in this case, proceeded to impose a moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.918" offset="9391647">After the moratorium expired and we received summary judgment, the department came up with an administrative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.524" offset="9429995">Their administrative policy was that Continental had to act as a "bank" under the bank holding company act, and thus be barred under the Douglas Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.963" offset="9467820">That administrative policy itself was illegal under Florida's very strict adherence to the doctrine of improper delegation of legislative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.355" offset="9513378">The Florida APA follows that very strictly, much more so than the federal APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.508" offset="9533962">It further had a problem, the department's policy, because we took the deposition of the director of the Division of Banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.347" offset="9569384">He didn't know this policy existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.382" offset="9577430">We finally showed him the pleading filed in this case to show that the policy existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.584" offset="9598328">He was unable to say when it was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.553" offset="9610136">He was unable to say what its scope was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.088" offset="9620271">He was unable to give any details regarding how this policy came into being, how it operated, or how it would effect Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.028" offset="9656111">Following that deposition, which I submit made it fairly clear to all the parties that this administrative policy wasn't going to prevent Continental from going forward, is when the Florida legislature enacted the 1984 statute which is being challenged here, which completely barred any out-of-state... excuse me, which completely barred any ISB chartering authority in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.447" offset="9765721">That statute, as the Court has noted, grandfathered the existing Florida ISBs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.815" offset="9787246">It further had its, unlike the rest of the banking legislation, had its effective date accelerated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.000" offset="12703974">First, with regard to the assertion that the court of appeals could have based attorneys fees on a sanction for bad faith conduct, as we indicated in our reply brief at page 5, footnote 9, the Roadway Express versus Piper case makes clear that in the absence of a finding of bad faith conduct by the court of appeals, or by the district court, there can be no upholding of attorneys fees based on a sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.734" offset="12806896">And Continental has admitted that there was no finding by the court of appeals of bad faith conduct, nor was there any finding by the district court of bad faith conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.871" offset="12835422">In fact, the district court denied attorneys fees on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.990" offset="12847856">Continental's motion for attorneys fees was simply a two sentence motion which incorporated its earlier appellate brief, and Lewis had replied to that appellate brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.263" offset="12880980">So the motion added nothing, rather than just incorporating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.881" offset="12895504">With the question about whether unconstitutional motivation is enough to strike down a state statute, or indeed a federal statute, I think there are two decisions of this Court that are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.773" offset="12939076">Palmer versus Thompson in 403 U.S. 217, which was an equal protection case, and the United States versus O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, which was a First Amendment case involving a congressional statute about burning draft cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.317" offset="13005218">And in both cases this Court said that there, it was disinclined to strike down a statute based only on allegations of unconstitutional motivation, because it is often very hard to determine exactly what motivates each and every legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.975" offset="13059866">So I think that those cases really repudiate the notion that unconstitutional motivation, without any showing of unconstitutional impact, is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.016" offset="13099990">I think that the questions of Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy indicated what we have been expressing, which is that there is no showing that Florida was obliged to open loopholes in the Douglas Amendment, that Florida was somehow constitutionally required to open loopholes so the Douglas Amendment wouldn't bite upon out-of-state bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.679" offset="13190687">And if that is true, and the United States indicated that they agreed with that position in their jurisdictional brief at page 17, then we say for the same reason it can't be a violation of the Commerce Clause for Florida even-handedly to withdraw a chartering option from everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.939" offset="13243664">That that is the price they paid for taking that option away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.908" offset="13259546">Lastly, with regard to the question of 1983 versus the federal question statute 1331, we have cited Bowman versus Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, an 1885 case, on page 46 of our principal brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.500" offset="13321927">And, I think that that case, when carefully read, indicates that the Court was there confronted with a Commerce Clause claim, and the Court found that that claim might be one arising under the Constitution, but it did not involve any right secured by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.094" offset="13380336">That was a case only ten years after the federal question statute was passed, only 14 years after 1983 was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.812" offset="13403220">So I think the Court, at that time, understood the distinction between the broad arising under language and the more narrow secured, rights secured by language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.152" offset="13436552">If there are no other questions, I will conclude the argument.</text>
