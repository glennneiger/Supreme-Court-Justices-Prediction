            <text syncTime="10.206" offset="190184">Mr. Guillot.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory H. Guillot</label>
            <text syncTime="18.795" offset="224561">This case involves the FCC's policies of awarding substantial preferences in comparative licensing proceedings to certain minority and female applicants for new television and radio broadcast stations throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.721" offset="280254">The Petitioner Metro in 1982 filed its application for a construction permit for a new UHF television station at Channel 60 in Orlando, Florida but ultimately lost in the comparative contest due to Rainbow Broadcasting Company, the Respondent intervenors', enhancement credits for minority and female ownership composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.718" offset="368235">This outcome, along with the preferential treatment policies resulting in it, was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit by a 2-1 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.406" offset="407000">The lower court's holding had followed an initial remand in the case and the remand of the record in the case as part of an active investigation into the factual statutory and constitutional underpinnings of the Commission's preference policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.083" offset="461753">During the remand, the Commission had held all cases in abeyance, including the present one, pending its determination regarding whether the policies were ordinarily tailored and otherwise constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.141" offset="505952">But in 1987 the Congress passed an appropriations act defunding the Commission's inquiry and specifically directing that this case be decided in accordance with the minority and female preferences that existed prior to the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.799" offset="560600">The issues presented in the case are twofold: One, whether the Commission's policies of awarding the preferences, which were created absent any findings of past discrimination and for the sole purpose of promoting program diversity, violate the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.445" offset="635206">And secondly, whether the congressional entrenchment of the communications... the Federal Communications Commission's policies and its other associated actions in the appropriations act violated the equal protection clause of the Fifth Amendment or exceeded its authority, whatever authority it has under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.555" offset="703647">This case is unlike other so-called affirmative action cases which this Court has heard in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.227" offset="730292">Unlike the model program approved in Fullilove or the academic admissions system hypothetically approved by the Court in Bakke, in this case the preference programs of the FCC have resulted in actual discrimination against Metro Broadcasting which, importantly, is a corporation comprised of both a minority member and nonminority members.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.058" offset="817645">Unlike the program under review in Fullilove, the programs reviewed in Wygant or Croson, the FCC's preference policies are not founded on the remedying of past discrimination but upon the pursuit of program diversity, an amorphous concept which, as we shall examine, has intense First Amendment implications as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.221" offset="898311">Unlike the other programs reviewed by this Court in the past, three separate governmental entities, not just one, have had a hand in establishing or perpetuating the Commission's policies: the courts, the FCC and the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.814" offset="952646">But regardless of these distinctions between this case and past cases, one thing is for certain; and that is, that the Commission's policies impose race, gender and ethnic-based classifications and that those classifications, we feel, are presumptively invalid but, at minimum, they require close examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.916" offset="1081064">It is absolutely clear, in our opinion, that the gender-based issue is... is before the Court for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.504" offset="1103425">First of all, the lower court did not consider gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.606" offset="1115755">It only considered the minority preferences because of dicta contained in the Commission's denial of Metro's application for review that said that the minority... it was not clear that the gender preference, being only a 5 percent one, was dispositive in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.616" offset="1171866">However, on remand, in an actual order of the Commission, which we feel is what this Court should review, the Commission held that the minority and female preferences together were dispositive, and that was the holding of the review board as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.958" offset="1225260">This Court is to review judgments, we feel, as Justice Stevens pointed out in Fullilove at page 411, note 6, and Black v. Cutler Labs, and not just statements such as the one accompanying the Commission's denial of Metro's application for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.968" offset="1285237">But there is... there is a more important reason, Your Honor, and that is that in this case, as we shall examine, the minority and female preferences are pitted together in a comparative licensing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.324" offset="1322644">They are not... neither one of them... are considered separately, and you really can't examine one without examining the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.228" offset="1346259">And you can't really examine the tailoring of the program without examining how the two... the two preferences fit together, both the gender and the minority and ethnic preferences.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.330" offset="2310700">The Commission has said that the rationale underlying the two preferences are the same, and the only reason that people wanted them considered separately is because no one wants to focus on the way that the two policies operate together, and that is one of the burdens that's imposed upon not only nonminorities but minorities under the Commission's preference plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.529" offset="2395546">To the extent that female ownership is said to contribute to program diversity and that it's valuable, every time a female applicant comes against an applicant that has a minority principal, that value is defeated, and so there is also an impact on minorities and females that have been... that are the acknowledged beneficiaries of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.092" offset="2477779">In order to clarify these things a little bit, I think it's important to look at the way that these policies developed and how the weights of the two policies really came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.715" offset="2524277">The Communications Act of 1934 gave the Commission a broad public interest mandate in awarding licenses for broadcast stations, and it said that in making a grant of any application it was to determine that the public interest would be served thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.891" offset="2580911">If more than one applicant applied for a broadcast station, a comparative hearing must be held to determine which of the applicants would provide the best service to the public in favor of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.515" offset="2627409">The Communications Act didn't establish any criteria for rendering this determination, and after many years of trial and error, in 1965 the Commission passed its Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings, which identified two general goals which were to govern the entire licensing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.410" offset="2698984">The first was to effect a maximum diffusion, or diversification of control of the media of mass communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.583" offset="2731689">This was a goal that had grounds in both antitrust and First Amendment considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.904" offset="2753005">Given the presumed scarcity of the broadcast spectrum, the antitrust considerations would disfavor one person or just a few people having control over all of the media outlets in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.227" offset="2802324">The second acknowledged goal of the program is to achieve the best practicable service to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.715" offset="2828238">This criteria, unlike the diversification criterion, was based on an examination of what the proposed broadcaster would do for the local community, for the community of license that was proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.839" offset="2872751">In the old days, prior to the deregulatory era, potential licensees had to go out into the communities and ascertain the community needs by interviewing public officials, interviewing minority groups and finding out what gaps needed to be filled in programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.948" offset="2933146">Those requirements are no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.067" offset="2945684">The Commission prepared criteria from the 1965 Policy Statement originally were race neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.804" offset="2968568">That changed, however, in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.156" offset="2982047">TV 9 v. FCC was the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' direction to the FCC that minority ownership must be taken into account in accordance with the public interest standard... mandate of the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.916" offset="3037009">But the decision didn't really clarify where it was to be taken into account in the Commission's comparative process, and there has been a lot of question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.939" offset="3073162">The rationale for taking race into account expressed in TV 9 was that there would be a maximum diffusion of ownership of the media of mass communications if we kind of broke up concentrations of certain minority... certain majority groups in the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.615" offset="3135856">It was a diversification-based criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.167" offset="3150066">Pursuant thereto, the Court said that it's upon ownership that the public policy places primary reliance with respect to diversification of content.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.125" offset="3185906">All of the content language in TV 9, all of the goals of serving program diversity, were really supposed benefits of pursuing the primary goal of diffusion of the media of mass communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.033" offset="3241495">The FCC in 1978 did not give a preference for minority ownership under the diversification criterion, however, notwithstanding this language in TV 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.740" offset="3280365">In WPIX, the Commission chose to award enhancements under the best practicable service criterion, a criterion not grounded in whether one group has control over the media, but a criterion grounded in a determination of which applicant could best serve the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.715" offset="6616202">But what we're saying, Your Honor, is that even under Fullilove there's a two-prong test, whether the objectives of the legislation are within Congress' power, and Justice Kennedy referred to the commerce clause as being one possible basis for the exercise of that power; but second, whether the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria are a permissible means for Congress to carry out its objectives within the due process clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2684.672" offset="10888058">The root of the FCC's regulatory power in this area lies in the First Amendment guarantee that multiple voices produce the most informed electorate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.428" offset="11447079">But that the Court's holding in Bakke that diversity of viewpoint is a compelling state interest in the academic field would certainly be as valid or more valid in the area of broadcasting where you're talking about the entire Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.242" offset="11522311">The... some of the confusion, I think, perhaps as to the purpose is caused by the fact that the Commission's justification of the race-conscious criteria that it is using stems from the fact that in seeking diversity of viewpoint they first identified the missing voices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.239" offset="11610292">To that extent, one would have to say that it is... if there was no past deprivation or exclusion there would be no need to look specifically to include those people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.767" offset="13004499">It may be your background, but what we have done here is identify those groups that have been excluded from the mass media.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.688" offset="13040130">When the Commission started this program in 1978, fully only 1 percent of the broadcast outlets in this country were owned by minority individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.746" offset="13088404">Today after 18 years... 12 years, the latest figures that we have in the Congressional Research study is that 3.5 percent of all broadcast outlets are owned by minority individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.692" offset="13156114">I'd like to just address one or two things that have been alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.345" offset="13178788">The first is that the minority enhancement that the Commission gives is one of a number of multiple factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.867" offset="13212852">It is by no means a decision factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.819" offset="13220689">In fact, in this case Rainbow did not win simply because it got a minority preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.407" offset="13250991">It proposed a larger amount of qualitative integration, more of its ownership was to be integrated into the management, and it was given credit for its past broadcast experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.317" offset="13302609">The Commission considers multiple factors in addition to simply whether or not people are going to be integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.887" offset="13332911">The Commission considers whether or not the proposals are technically advantageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.207" offset="13354226">The Commission considers whether there are any other stations owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.794" offset="13376587">The Commission considers whether or not programming is offered as a specialized basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.098" offset="13401769">This as a plus factor is perhaps less influential than the plus factor in Bakke that was referred to in the Harvard plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.204" offset="13442207">Here, what we are talking about is fully qualified applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.275" offset="13458507">How do you choose between two fully qualified applicants?</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.810" offset="13472613">In the past the Commission has made certain standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.548" offset="13495601">They have said when you have two fully qualified applicants we will look at such things as local residence, we will look at such things as what civic activities you've been involved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.586" offset="13531755">They have now said we will look at race also because this is an area that is across the board underrepresented in the broadcast industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.144" offset="13581910">There is no danger that this is going to go on forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.881" offset="13604897">The figures are so low that there is really no reason to consider how it ends, but at this point what we are talking about is Congress is authorizing this program on a year-to-year basis, so we are not talking about any possibility of going on into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.992" offset="13669368">In deciding whether or not to have this program--</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.896" offset="13692982">Of course, I take it diversity of views is a constant goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.098" offset="13705730">If you reached racial proportionality, whatever that means, in ownership and the regulations ceased and there was an imbalance, I would suppose the same diversity of view problem would arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.090" offset="13757766">So it seems to me that what you are... since you are not relying on something that is remedial, you are espousing a rationale that must necessarily be permanent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.766" offset="13812414">Whether there is a minority preference or not is a matter that is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.319" offset="13838641">The whole Communications Act, the whole Commission's allocation of new licenses, is premised on diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.259" offset="13870406">There is no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.092" offset="13877720">That would go on as long as the Commission has licenses to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.644" offset="13891931">Congress has approved that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.013" offset="13897469">Congress has insisted that the Commission continue to look at the diversity of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.517" offset="13923487">What they have said here is that on the basis of their experience, on the basis of 30 years' worth of Congressional hearings, Commission hearings... and I commend the Senate brief to your attention for the background of that... that we believe that this is an area that the Commission must consider and continue to consider until we are satisfied at such time that the past deprivation has been... the balance has been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.586" offset="14035709">In Fullilove this Court made clear that Congress need not have a record in the same sense that a court or an administrative agency indeed must compile a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.310" offset="14086595">In the area of minority preferences, Congress has been holding hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.214" offset="14110210">Congress has had experience in this area for almost 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.516" offset="14127451">Contrary to Petitioner's suggestion, it would be difficult, indeed, to conclude that Congress didn't know what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.021" offset="14157440">Congress has been intimately involved in this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.092" offset="14177711">The basis for congressional action here has extended both in terms of the legislative approach and in terms of hearing approach.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory H. Guillot</label>
            <text syncTime="3531.875" offset="14276871">Oh, my gosh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.675" offset="14280111">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.160" offset="14286066">A couple of important points in that two minutes, Mr. Chief Justice and other members of the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.647" offset="14308009">The Commission here is caught in a grave and painful vice between content regulation and stereotyping with the program diversity rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.936" offset="14349074">If the Commission is wrong and minority ownership or female ownership does not result in a different kind of programming, then the Commission is engaged in impermissible stereotyping based on predictions of what a particular person will do in a particular occasion on account of their blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.548" offset="14423575">On the other hand, assuming the Commission is right and that we can make accurate predictive judgments about a person's behavior based upon their race, then that means that the Commission, by selecting these groups, knowing that their behavior is going to be a certain way, is seeking a content objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.894" offset="14496927">They want the type of content that they believe it can be identified by these racial and sexual characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.198" offset="14526184">So either it's stereotyping or it's content regulation, but it's not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.185" offset="14546142">The second point, Your Honor, is that again both the Commission and Rainbow now are speaking in terms of a diversification rationale for the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.625" offset="14579892">That is not the rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.208" offset="14586161">The rationale is program diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.993" offset="14597342">The Commission has a diversification criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.779" offset="14608522">If it was truly the rationale they could incorporate a race neutral preference under the diversification rationale and say if a hitherto prejudiced-against or discriminated-against group wants to enter the media and they can show some past discrimination or show that they have been denied access, we will give them a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.423" offset="14679053">We won't specify what the groups are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.875" offset="14688875">Why did the Commission have to specify those groups, and why are those groups exclusive of a list of program diversity?</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.029" offset="14717505">Third, these policies have no end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.564" offset="14727640">They will continue to operate until this proportional underrepresentation is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.635" offset="14747911">In the last 18 years, minority ownership has only increased 1 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.987" offset="14765361">I am no mathematician, but it would appear that we have 600 years left of the Commission's minority and female preferences based on proportional equal representation.</text>
