            <text syncTime="49.997" offset="339626">Although Florida's choice differs from that of the majority of the other states, and indeed of the Federal Government, this does not mean that Florida is constitutionally prohibited from making the policy choices that it makes--</text>

            <text syncTime="124.647" offset="638258">Florida is a capital punishment state.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.783" offset="650797">There is no statute of limitations with respect to capital punishment in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.485" offset="669605">Therefore, an investigation that is begun during one term of the grand jury and concluded during that term may be picked up months or years later, based upon newly discovered evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.041" offset="911812">Indeed, if Mr. Smith here were to have obtained a transcript of his testimony, it would not have simply said in the transcript that which he was responding to.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.087" offset="1087982">And it is our position that the First Amendment, which is the basis of the Eleventh Circuit's decision and the basis for the claim made by Mr. Smith here, is not susceptible, necessarily, to a turning on or turning off like a water faucet.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.330" offset="1149004">The First Amendment flows with respect to participants and cannot be cut off at the point of limiting any disclosure solely to testimonial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.536" offset="1189859">It's not so much Mr. Smith's testimony that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.506" offset="1209713">It is the testimony of grand jury witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2808.076" offset="11371972">With respect to the Federal system, as was pointed out earlier, even though the Federal Government has made a particular policy choice, that doesn't mean that that represents the most effective choice as viewed from other or by other jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.038" offset="11443861">There is no evidence in the record that establishes that the choices made by the other states and the one made by the Federal Government are more effective or as effective than the choice made by the State of Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.908" offset="11587326">And the effect of that, the State of Florida has determined, weighs more heavily with respect to preserving the interest of the criminal justice system than any putative First Amendment claim may weigh with respect to Mr. Smith and other witnesses.</text>
