            <text syncTime="11.290" offset="188690">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.574" offset="213767">The issue in this case is whether uninsured demand notes which were advertised as investments and purchased by thousands of ordinary people for more than $10 million are securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.425" offset="269147">Under any proper application of the 1934 act, these notes are securities and their purchasers are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.581" offset="309793">Let me briefly touch the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.482" offset="321392">These notes were sold by the Farmer's Co-Op of Arkansas and Oklahoma for more than 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.898" offset="355142">They were uninsured and unsecured.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.340" offset="368830">The Co-Op is not a regulated financial institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.235" offset="388474">It's not a bank; it's not a savings and loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.187" offset="400281">It's in the business of buying and selling farm products.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.998" offset="415537">Over 25,000 people were solicited every month.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.520" offset="437584">They were told in prominent advertisements,</text>
            <text syncTime="76.304" offset="448765">"This is an investment program. "</text>
            <text syncTime="78.305" offset="456706">"These notes are investments. "</text>
            <text syncTime="80.556" offset="465692">"Buy these notes as investments. "</text>
            <text syncTime="83.658" offset="478126">The notes paid a variable rate of interest which was adjusted every month by the Co-Op's management.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.225" offset="512399">The notes were sold to members of the Co-Op and to non-members.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.818" offset="530789">Let me make a point on the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.370" offset="548970">To be a member of the Co-Op cost nothing more than $5.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.084" offset="567883">A simple $5.00 payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.924" offset="575197">About half the people in the local community were members of the Co-Op.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.740" offset="594423">At the time of the bankruptcy of the Co-Op, 1,685 people held notes which they had purchased for over $10 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.188" offset="844259">In terms of how many of those purchasers were also members of the Co-Op, there is no precise record.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.725" offset="882397">Again, to be a member of the Co-Op, it's a $5.00 purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.959" offset="899325">This was a rural community and the Co-Op operated feed stores and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.684" offset="926283">So, someone would buy a membership for $5.00, because at the end of the year you could get a patronage dividend if your purchases were sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.168" offset="964213">The population of the community in which the Co-Op had outlets and was headquartered was about 70,000... 23,000 people were Co-Op members.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.688" offset="1018234">If you add in members of their families, et cetera, you could almost say that the general public and the membership of the Co-Op was almost coextensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.965" offset="1055328">But, in direct response, Justice Kennedy, to your question, it is not absolutely clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.060" offset="2847746">And the reason that Congress requires that is because, as this Court has noted in several cases, there is a need to be flexible in this area to both effectuate Congress' purpose and to deal with the many different sorts of financial instruments which promoters devised to separate people from their money, which is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.186" offset="2940219">This Court ha indicated in the Securities Industry Association case in dicta that the exclusion about which we are talking now is an explicit exception for commercial paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.668" offset="3010123">And the definition used by Congress came from the Federal Reserve Board and investment bankers who were absolutely clear when they appeared before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.135" offset="3072086">They said, this is about commercial paper; we want an exemption for commercial paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.559" offset="3089744">And they persuaded Congress that that would be appropriate because, they said, commercial paper is not generally available to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.737" offset="3130495">It's not sold to the public, it's not offered to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.105" offset="3243867">Arthur Young does want this read absolutely literally, except for the demand note point which I've already noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.049" offset="3275736">And Arthur Young's conclusion is that the only thing that matters is maturity.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.192" offset="3356298">And every lower court which has taken a look at this has said that's a perverse result which would be at odds with the purpose of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.191" offset="3400288">Specifically, every three-year note which a consumer issues in connection with his purchase of a car would be a security, subject to regulation, while public offerings of, say, 45-day investment notes, which is exactly the scheme that Ponzi used in the '20s in Boston... 45-day notes publicly offered as investments... would be unregulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.688" offset="6006263">--Under the family resemblance test with cespe a short-term notes, the test would proceed as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.304" offset="6028729">The test first starts with the statutory language defining a security as including any note, and then takes account of the exclusionary language, and then construes those provisions in light of the preparatory clause unless the context otherwise requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.355" offset="6084944">For example, a note having in it a maturity date of less than nine months is initially presumed not to be a security, following the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.280" offset="6124650">But then the party seeking to overcome that presumption, for example, in this case, would have to show that the context otherwise requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.727" offset="6154430">The first thing that party would show is, look, this isn't commercial paper, so I can't be shut out under the securities laws for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.211" offset="6188389">The second step... or, actually, the way the test works, it would have been the first... my note doesn't resemble both types of notes that all would agree fall outside the scope of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.997" offset="6231439">So, we think the exclusionary language does have a place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.501" offset="6245545">Although it hasn't come up yet, under the Second Circuit's test, the Second Circuit used the phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.576" offset="6277832">"fits the general description of commercial paper. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.558" offset="6289744">So there could be... it hasn't happened yet, but there might be an instrument that for one particular reason doesn't qualify as commercial paper within the strictures of let's say the SEC's 61 release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.927" offset="6343243">But it otherwise might be so close that perhaps it shouldn't be covered by the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.881" offset="6367067">That case hasn't come up yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.072" offset="6375739">But we do think that the language does have meaning and we disagree with any suggestion that because of the way we interpret the exclusionary clause that it writes it out of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.309" offset="6420774">It doesn't, and in fact Judge Friendly, in the Exchange National Bank case and Chemical Bank, made clear that that was his disagreement with some other courts, that threw up their hands and said, well, I guess we're just writing this out of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.729" offset="6474378">The Second Circuit's test does not, and it still plays a part, as it must, because it is written into the law and we can't disregard the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.195" offset="7728255">And they would have the Court do this in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.996" offset="7739436">Either to take an exemption from registration, what's been referred to as the commercial paper exemption, out of the 1933 act and read it as if it were in the 1934 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.206" offset="7792308">Or, alternatively, they'd take four words that are in the exclusion... note, draft, bill of exchange, bankers of acceptance... and say what Congress really meant by those four phrases was commercial paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.694" offset="7854270">Now, first, in the 1934 act when Congress wanted to refer to commercial paper, it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.390" offset="7889065">This is not... I apologize... in our brief, but in rereading the original '34 act in preparation for argument, the phrase commercial paper is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.046" offset="7927726">It's in Section 15 of the act where Congress was granting the SEC authority for rulemaking with respect to certain market-making activities except for exempt securities and commercial paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.099" offset="7991883">In other words, when Congress wanted to use the phrase, it knew how to use it and it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.122" offset="8019991">Would it have, with that background, have used note, draft, bill of exchange and bankers of acceptance to mean commercial paper and only commercial paper when elsewhere in the same statute it used those words specifically?</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.391" offset="8081013">The two statues, the 1934 and '33 act, have very different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.815" offset="8102747">The 1934 act was adopted to regulate exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.189" offset="8124272">Short-term notes were not traded on exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.711" offset="8138378">They would not have been subject to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.162" offset="8148095">They were excluded from the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.155" offset="8156141">The 1933 act, on the other hand, regulates the offering of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.669" offset="8178188">And although at the time the statutes were adopted short-term notes were not traded, they were offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.374" offset="8205042">So the 1933 act, with its purpose of regulating the offering of securities, includes short-term notes in the definition and only excludes certain of those notes from registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.599" offset="8253943">The 1934 act, on the other hand, with its purpose of regulating the exchanges, didn't need to address short-term notes, which simply were not traded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.467" offset="8293336">The government also suggests that the Court ought to read into the 1934 act language that's not there to prevent frauds from being committed with short-term instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.928" offset="8355194">The fact of the matter is the 1933 act itself provides for the SEC and for the investing public protection with respect to the offering of short-term instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.956" offset="8407334">There is no reason, in other words, for this Court to read into the 1934 act language that isn't there to protect the public because for that purpose they're protected under the 1933 act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.505" offset="9133539">A specific example, investment contracts, which is a term in the definition of security, has no particular... intrinsic meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.100" offset="9295916">But, certainly, since... since the statutes were adopted, it has generally been accepted that not all notes can be securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.314" offset="10420748">We have a very unusual instrument here and while the issues that this case presents are important in the broader range for many of the other notes that's traded, there is little use of demand notes as we have seen them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.855" offset="10498907">And we have suggested that the... that the test the Court should use as they distinguish between the notes that are securities and the notes that aren't follows from this Court's Landreth decision where it set up a two-stage test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.168" offset="10564213">The Court said, first we'll look at the characteristics of the instrument and see if it has the characteristics of a security of that name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.755" offset="10610502">And if it does not, then we will treat it as an unusual instrument under this Court's Howey test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.680" offset="10642267">So, it's a test that operates in two stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.131" offset="10651984">It comes from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.712" offset="10662329">It comes from this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.025" offset="10675599">It draws on 40 years of case law that's build up around the Howey decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.889" offset="10695034">And it's a more positive and predictive test than the family resemblance test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.403" offset="10725127">The Court in Landreth was speaking only to stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.798" offset="10742681">The same issue had been in Forman ten years earlier, which was also a stock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.271" offset="10764624">But the courts of appeals since Landreth have applied it to other enumerated instruments, and it's a workable test for all the various enumerated instruments in addition to stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.819" offset="10818750">And if the Court applies Landreth to notes, what it will have given the lower courts and practitioners is one framework in which all what is a security questions can be answered rather than a series of different tests for different types of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.243" offset="10896490">The other tests that have been offered to the Court are not as grounded in the statute as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.628" offset="10930032">They don't come out of this Court's decisions, and they are rigid in application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.981" offset="10959393">For example, the most predominant of the lower court tests says an instrument must be either a commercial instrument or it's an investment instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.751" offset="11010489">That's a terribly difficult analysis with something like these demand notes which analytically don't logically fall into either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.784" offset="11042672">The investment commercial test also gets to the result by simply having a laundry list of factors from which a court can select, greatly reducing any predictive value of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.316" offset="11100768">The family resemblance test which is advanced by the Petitioners and the government, as I said, has no articulated rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.410" offset="11137130">It really is a definition by default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.783" offset="11146639">It says if it's not like these six or seven instruments, then it's a security and that creates the danger of either you're going to apply those rigid items or a judge is free to do, if you will, as the securities administrators say, whatever appeals in a particular case, and that deprives the test of its predictive value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.138" offset="11240053">Now, going back to the Landreth test that we advance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.359" offset="11256980">The characteristics we would be talking about for a note would be the characteristics of instruments that are unquestionably securities and can be called either capital notes, bonds, debentures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.724" offset="11334407">They're all very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.645" offset="11338064">They have these common characteristics: they tend to be long-term, they're often publicly traded, they have elaborate documentation surrounding them and they are perceived by users as being securities, which this Court has said on several occasions is an important factor in evaluating whether something is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.160" offset="11444121">Now, applying that to these demand notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.995" offset="11463452">They're certainly not long-term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.136" offset="11472020">They were demand instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.057" offset="11479752">They were... they wouldn't have... they were not... they would not have been publicly traded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.950" offset="11503263">You've seen the stationery store form that they're based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.295" offset="11524683">And there's no evidence in the record that they were perceived by the Co-Op members that held them as being securities, no perception that the benefits of the securities laws followed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.872" offset="11574943">So, not having the characteristics of those notes and similar instruments that are undoubtedly securities, the Landreth test then goes to the second stage, the Howey test, which this Court said in Landreth was the appropriate test for all unusual instruments, which these demand notes certainly appear to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.008" offset="11663550">Howey focuses the test this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.641" offset="11678074">On whether the instrument is an investment in a common enterprise made with the expectation of profit solely from the efforts of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.595" offset="11717885">Here something payable on demand doesn't carry with it the element of risk that is inherent in the concept of investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.805" offset="11778698">What happened to these demand note holders... the Co-Op went into bankruptcy... is exactly the risk that anyone has where there is an obligation to do something in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.685" offset="11834286">And that's true whether it's a co-op paying on demand notes or whether it's a corporation honoring a service contract on an automobile or a washing machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.499" offset="11869499">And that is contrasted by this Court's Forman decision, for example, with the kind of risk of market fluctuation that we tend to associate with securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.339" offset="11920804">So, at the first level--</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.036" offset="11967615">But the interest rate constantly would change periodically and an investor could immediately demand their money if they didn't like where the Co-Op had moved the interest rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.866" offset="12018920">So, there isn't the kind of market risk there where somebody, for example, is locked into an interest rate over a long term or watches the value of capital appreciate or depreciate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.254" offset="12076494">It's simply the concept... the right to immediate payment is at odds with the concept of investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.192" offset="12116304">Similarly, with the portion of the Howey test that speaks to expectation of profit through the efforts of others, this Court has dealt on several occasions with what profit means in a securities law context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.431" offset="12189238">And it has said profit refers to either capital appreciation or earnings as in the sense of dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.010" offset="12231557">Now, an economist could define profit very broadly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.877" offset="12275024">But for securities law purposes, the Court has focused on the kind of profit one expects with a securities instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.405" offset="12321104">And that the Court identified, for example, in Forman as either capital appreciation or earnings in the form of dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.099" offset="12355899">In the Court's Weaver decision, the Court dealt with an interest-bearing instrument and it distinguished for this purpose that instrument from the one before the Court in the Tcherepnin case which were withdrawable capital shares that paid dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.653" offset="12438133">The Court drew that context, that with dividends there was the earnings of the entity, the anticipation of that, that didn't exist where what was being paid simply was... simply was interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.689" offset="13394214">In the Court's Landreth decision, it dealt with an instrument that was held by one person and it was a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.445" offset="13425248">The securities laws were never intended, as this Court has said, to regulate all fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.520" offset="13457535">And the number of people who may hold an instrument can't be determinative of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.856" offset="13494943">In this instance we're dealing with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.230" offset="13524409">Protection comes to people who hold short-term securities fully under the Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.397" offset="13569130">In this case, because short-term notes were not traded, there was no need definitionally under the 1934 act to include short-term notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.756" offset="13618554">So, the statute excludes from the definition all notes with maturity of less than nine months, which, whatever other anomalies there may be with demand instruments, seems clear under at least the law that we've offered... and there's been none offered on the other side... that demand is immediate and... I'm sorry, there is a suggestion in, I believe it's the government's brief, that in a 1961 SEC release on commercial paper they suggested that demand was not immediate maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.662" offset="13774139">They based that on a Federal Reserve position taken years earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.145" offset="13796082">The Fed, in 1966, reversed that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.468" offset="13813323">The Fed has said since 1966, demand instruments have immediate maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.872" offset="13839028">The SEC has simply not had occasion to revisit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.166" offset="13852193">So, whether one looks at state law, as we believe is appropriate here, or to those analogous sources of federal law, would suggest that the demand notes maturing upon issuance are squarely within the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.356" offset="13924918">The plain language should be applied to exclude these instruments from the definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3614.837" offset="14602848">There is no legislative history as to the reason for the omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.300" offset="14616745">Now, there's two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.449" offset="14625313">One, Congress meant to exclude only short-term commercial paper not offered to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.676" offset="14654152">Or, what Arthur Young says, which is Congress also meant to exclude short-term investment notes widely offered to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.321" offset="14692814">We suggest, and I think Judge Friendly has indicated, that interpretation is inconceivable because the Senate and the House said the definitions of security in the '33 and '34 Acts are substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.903" offset="14759060">Our reading of it, the reading that every court of appeals has given it, is consistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.415" offset="14785183">Those two definitions of securities are substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.108" offset="14799916">The only thing out are notes not offered to the public that are commercial paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.003" offset="14819560">Their reading, I suggest, would create two definitions that would be widely different and there's no basis for it, no history to it, and it is incomprehensible that that's what they wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.132" offset="14875984">Arthur Young's alternative test... the number one... here's where they say context does matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.387" offset="14917049">They admit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.229" offset="14920392">And what is the most important factor, the one that is brought up again and again?</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.021" offset="14939619">Where did you buy the note?</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.353" offset="14944948">Did you buy it in a stationery store or did you get it from a lawyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.845" offset="14958845">That is... what possible difference could that make?</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.467" offset="14977339">It is a ridiculous factor that was pulled out solely for this case.</text>
