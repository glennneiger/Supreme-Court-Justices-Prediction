            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144882">We'll hear argument next this morning in No. 88-1076, J. Paul Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.608" offset="187305">Mr. Berger, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_m_berger" startTime="63.582" stopTime="226.843">
            <label>Mr. Michael M. Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="63.582" offset="399210">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this case involves a congressional intent to preempt state real property law throughout the country and in so doing transform private property into public recreational hiking and biking trails.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.355" offset="478204">This morning I would like to address key elements of the two fundamental issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.641" offset="507357">First, the invalidity of this statute under the Fifth Amendment, examining both the Second Circuit's broad holding that under no set of facts could this statute ever be a taking of property, and then discussing the inability of the claims court to provide compensation for any taking which might occur because of the strict congressional prohibition on the expenditure of funds which were not appropriated for the purpose of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.000" offset="632849">Second, I would like to discuss the invalidity of this statute as a commerce clause regulatory measure in light of the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission cannot approve the conversion of an abandoned railroad right of way to a recreational hiking or biking trail until after it first determines that there is no future railroad need for the particular right of way in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.399" offset="742459">I would like to turn first, then, to the Fifth Amendment problems in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.723" offset="767746">First, what the statute does is clearly to override and change settled state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.427" offset="798570">The reason, in fact, why this statute was enacted in 1983 as an amendment to the National Trails Act was that trail groups had tried to transform abandoned railroad rights of way into recreational trails before that and found themselves confronted by state courts which would not permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.682" offset="883520">The reason that the state courts would not permit it is that what the railroads acquired, usually in the 1800s, was an easement for railroad right of way purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.960" offset="924689">And under settled state law in virtually every stated in this nation, once the railroad stopped using the right of way for railroad purposes, for running trains, the easement would vanish and the underlying fee title owner would be entitled to full use, enjoyment, and possession of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.582" offset="995115">So that state courts were not, based on that body of law, permitting the transformation of abandoned rights of way into some other use because the railroad in a very classic sense owned nothing and therefore could transfer nothing.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="226.843" stopTime="251.621">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="226.843" offset="1052167">Mr. Nance... excuse me... Mr. Berger, is it possible that the state law that applies to define the property interest of your clients would take into account the federal determinations of public purpose or railway use?</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="253.013" offset="1156866">Is it possible that the state law determination would look back at the federal position?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_m_berger" startTime="260.957" stopTime="322.921">
            <label>Mr. Michael M. Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="260.957" offset="1188631">--I believe it does work into the calculus, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.640" offset="1203364">The way that it works in is that it's been consistently held both by this Court and by the Vermont Supreme Court that until the Interstate Commerce Commission declares an abandonment of a railroad right of way there is no room for the state law to come into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.222" offset="1277760">State law, until that point, is preempted by the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.547" offset="1298972">And my clients have no quarrel with that state of affairs where the Interstate Commerce Commission, exercising its expertise on the need for rail transportation and the need for particular rights of way, determines whether the abandonment of a right of way is appropriate in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.110" offset="1373264">Once there is an abandonment, however, this Court's opinions are likewise clear that state law then takes over and controls and the ICC and the federal determinations are out of the picture and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="322.921" stopTime="334.310">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="322.921" offset="1436480">Well, here, of course, they may take the position that there still has been no abandonment because of the ultimate reserved potential use.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_m_berger" startTime="334.310" stopTime="400.564">
            <label>Mr. Michael M. Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="334.310" offset="1482038">--The way that that works, Justice O'Connor, is that before the ICC considers whether to approve the negotiations between a railroad and either a state and local agency or a recognized trail organization to transform this right of way into a recreational right of way from a full-blown transportation right of way, the ICC first has to determine that it is appropriate for the railroad to abandon railroad usage of this right of way and that there is neither present nor future public railroad need for the right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.807" offset="1652043">That's in Section 10903, 49 USC, and the statute is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.542" offset="1670955">The ICC is also very clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.832" offset="1680151">They said earlier this year that in every trails case before they reach the trail question they will already have decided that the public use does not require continued railroad usage and permits the railroad to fully abandon the railroad usage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="400.564" stopTime="416.235">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="400.564" offset="1747129">Even if you are correct so far, I suppose it's arguable that you still have a Tucker Act remedy for your clients to get compensation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_m_berger" startTime="416.235" stopTime="525.150">
            <label>Mr. Michael M. Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="416.235" offset="1809822">That is certainly the other question in this case, and I'd be happy to address that since Your Honor is interested in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.251" offset="1837826">The Tucker Act, of course... and I must confess I find it strange standing here arguing that there is no right on behalf of my clients to recover compensation and find the Solicitor General arguing, oh, yes, they should be getting money for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.520" offset="1890906">The... analyzing the Tucker Act question gets us into the issue of what action Congress authorized the federal government to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.769" offset="1939912">And it may get a little bit technical, but this Court in Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto, in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act cases most recently, concluded that the Tucker Act and a suit for compensation in the claims court is available for authorized governmental activity and only for authorized governmental activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.136" offset="2037401">If it's not authorized, then this Court and the claims court treat it as a tort and that's not available for recompense under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.551" offset="2067076">So, we have to examine the statute in this case to determine what is it that Congress authorized anybody to do under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.247" offset="2101767">And what we find is that Congress authorized the conversion of abandoned railroad rights of way into recreational hiking and biking trails if that could be done without the expenditure of federal money unless Congress had specifically appropriated money for this program in advance of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.542" offset="2194972">That's in Section 101 of this statute, and it is as clear an expression of congressional attempt to control expense as I've ever seen.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.615" offset="2315240">What the statute says, and I'll be happy to read it for the record and for the Court, is</text>
            <text syncTime="555.715" offset="2367693">"Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, authority to enter into contracts and to make payments under this act shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriations acts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="571.535" offset="2431014">What the intent of Congress was in doing this was to create essentially a voluntary program that would result in no liability to the federal government if voluntary agreements could be worked out among the parties that they thought were involved in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.647" offset="2499455">The problem is that the way that the statute is set up, the way that the ICC administers it, the people who own the underlying fee interest in these rights of way are not even consulted, let alone brought into the picture.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.955" offset="2556611">Well, the Solicitor General in his brief right after having set forth that section says that this is not sufficient to withdraw the Tucker Act remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.803" offset="2604049">The language now is saying that any other provision of this act is a common provision in appropriation bills and is not the clear withdrawal of the Tucker Act remedy that we've required.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.792" offset="2648040">Your Honor, I recognize the Solicitor General has argued that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.446" offset="2666639">It seems to me that what we need to do is to look at what this Court has done with similar provisions in the past and with congressional restrictions on expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.062" offset="2709062">The classic case is the case which is cited in the briefs, called Hooe v. United States, a case this Court decided sometime in the '20s, I believe, but was relied on this by Court in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act cases a decade ago to describe and illustrate what this Court meant by authorized congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.679" offset="2807595">What happened in Hooe was that the Congress had created the Civil Service Commission, authorized it to both exist and rent quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.315" offset="2842077">And then it appropriated a sum of money for it to rent those quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.979" offset="2860781">The Commission went out and rented quarters but instead of renting $4,000 worth or space like Congress had told it to do, the Commission had a $6,000 appetite.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.817" offset="2904144">When the landlord accepted the rent from the Commission, didn't complain about it, never sued over the next couple of years to throw the Commission out of the space that wasn't being paid for, the landlord sued in the claims court and thought that he had either an implied contract from the government to pay for this extra space which was being occupied or he had a constitutional claim for a taking of his property without payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.574" offset="3015112">What this Court said was, analyzing it under the Tucker Act, when Congress said you could have $4,000 to rent space, that's what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.110" offset="3053251">And Congress did not authorize the occupancy of any space beyond what $4,000 would buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.625" offset="3079373">Therefore, the occupation of additional space by an agency of the federal government was unauthorized governmental activity and at best was a tort that was not compensate... compensable in the claims court either as an implied contract or as a constitutional remedy for a taking of property by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.160" offset="3165473">This was not authorized governmental conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.323" offset="3178116">And, as I said, when this Court decided the Regional Rail Reorganization Act cases a decade or so ago and examined some of the early precursors to this reorganization of the transportation statutes, it quoted from the Hooe case with approval on just what is authorized governmental action and what is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.113" offset="3361287">And as I say, as recently as the Regional Rail cases this Court quotes that line of authority... with approval... saying that in effect has carved out a branch of actions which the Court says are not actions of the government but are actions by government officials unauthorized by Congress, and the remedy for those actions is not in the claims court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.785" offset="6607994">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.128" offset="6629310">First, I would like to respond to Justice Kennedy's last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.292" offset="6646028">The statute does apply and has meaning in the fee simple situation and the railroad's incentive in that type of case would be to not abandon the railroad right of way because once it is abandoned, the ICC grants a Certificate of Abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.231" offset="6705796">If 20 years later the railroad wants to resume service, they would have to go through the initial application under 10903 of the Interstate Commerce Act for constructing a railroad and getting permission to run a railroad, which involves a more lengthy process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.732" offset="6767759">Under this scheme, if they resume service in the future, even in the fee simple situation, all they would have to do is notify the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.748" offset="6795866">So, the statute applies to all railroad rights of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.940" offset="6808614">It has incentives to apply in every type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.773" offset="6823974">The Court could affirm the decision of the ICC, and this is an action for judicial review, on any of three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.860" offset="6860232">We urge the Court to affirm on the Tucker Act ground, that even if there is a taking, there is an available remedy for compensation, which is all the Constitution requires, and that remedy is the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.638" offset="6903386">The two other possible grounds would be under Vermont law or, as the Second Circuit held, the statute may never result in a taking in either... in any case, in any conceivable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.297" offset="6946018">We think it would be inappropriate to resolve the case under Vermont law for essentially three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.820" offset="6968066">In the first place, the Commission did not look to Vermont law, did not resolve this case on the basis of Vermont law, and this is--</text>
