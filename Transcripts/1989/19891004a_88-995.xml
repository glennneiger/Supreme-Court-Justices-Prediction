            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="137875">We'll hear argument next in Number 88-995, Northbrook National Insurance Company versus Larry Brewer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Michael Jung</label>
            <text syncTime="25.583" offset="240171">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="27.895" offset="249366">In this case the Court is called on to revisit an issue which it last addressed in 1961, the right of workers' compensation insurers to avail themselves of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.515" offset="295864">The case involves questions of statutory interpretation relating to the direct action proviso of 28 U.S.C. Section 1332(c) which deems an insurance company to share the citizenship of its insured in a direct action against the insurer of a policy or contract of liability insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.087" offset="374126">The facts of the case are extraordinarily simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.397" offset="387397">In April of 1986 Larry Brewer, who was a Texas citizen, allegedly suffered a disabling on-the-job injury while working for Whitmire Line Clearance, Incorporated, which is a Texas corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.751" offset="436820">Brewer filed a claim for benefits with the Texas Industrial Accident Board, and in May of 1987 that board made an award in Brewer's factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.372" offset="471302">Pursuant to Texas law, that award was not against Whitmire but, rather, against Whitmire's compensation insurance carrier, Northbrook National Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.682" offset="512575">Northbrook is an Illinois corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.150" offset="522397">Northbrook chose to exercise its right under Texas law to bring a suit to set aside the board award, and it brought that suit in federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship between itself and Brewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.455" offset="575687">It did so with full awareness of two adverse Fifth Circuit precedents which had applied the direct action proviso to Texas workers' compensation suits where the employee and the employee shared common citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.216" offset="630649">Both the District Court and the Fifth Circuit panel felt obliged to follow those precedents, but each court questioned their soundness, particularly in light of a Sixth Circuit precedent holding that workers' compensation suits by insurers do not fall within the direct action proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.663" offset="700448">In my argument today I will first briefly address the context and legislative history of the direct action proviso and then turn to the two issues in this appeal, first, whether this is, indeed, a direction action on a policy or contract of liability insurance and, second, whether an action by an insurer rather than against an insurer falls within the direct action proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.841" offset="793235">As this Court is aware, in certain states... notably Louisiana and Wisconsin... an injured party is permitted to bring a direct action against the tortfeasor... excuse me, against the tortfeasor's liability insurance carrier without joining the tortfeasor and without first obtaining a judgment against the tortfeasor.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.959" offset="869617">In 1954 this Court not only sustained the constitutionality of such statutes, but also held in Lumberman's Mutual Casualty Company versus Elbert that such suits could be filed in federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship between the injured worker plaintiff... injured emp... plaintiff... and the insurance company defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.513" offset="951851">At about that same time attorneys for injured parties in the state of Louisiana began to disfavor their own state court system due to the unusual Louisiana appellate rule which permits free and open reexamination of jury findings and verdicts, and the results of these two phenomena was a massive increase in the dockets of the federal courts in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.863" offset="1045264">The direct action proviso was the congressional response to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.299" offset="1066998">By deeming the out-of-state insurer to share the citizenship of his in-state insured, the statute effectively eliminated most direct actions from the federal courts and Congress--</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Michael Jung</label>
            <text syncTime="255.352" offset="1159263">--That's correct, Your Honor, but the legislative history suggests that you do because Congress was concerned about plaintiffs choosing the federal courts so as to avoid the reexamination problem that prevailed in Louisiana state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.612" offset="1216314">And Congress in enacting the direct action proviso expressed concern, not only about the dockets in Louisiana, but about the fact that direct actions filed by injured parties in the federal courts did not fall within what Congress perceived as the spirit and intent of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.587" offset="1292174">Now, the congressional focus throughout the legislative history is on suits by injured parties against insurance companies and on the fact that such plaintiffs, if they come from in state and file their suit in federal court, have no need of the federal courts to avoid possible local bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.128" offset="1358316">There is no indication in the legislative history that Congress had any concern about the filing of suits by insurance carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.610" offset="1388304">Likewise, nothing indicates that Congress specifically had workers' compensation actions in mind when it enacted the direct action proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.092" offset="1418188">It stated that there were, at the time, two states, Louisiana and Wisconsin, which had direct action statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.276" offset="1442953">Obviously if workers' compensation suits... statutes had been regarded as direct action statutes, that statement could not have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.601" offset="1472210">Only three years earlier this Court in the Horton versus Liberty Mutual Insurance Company case had held that notwithstanding the withdrawal of removal jurisdiction over such suits, original diversity jurisdiction over workers' compensation suits persisted, and yet nothing in the legislative history of the direct action proviso suggests any intent to tamper with or alter this Court's decision in Horton or to otherwise affect workers' compensation suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.293" offset="1578998">The Congressional purpose in enacting the direct action proviso is mirrored in the language which Congress chose, particularly the term direct action.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.539" offset="1615988">The lower courts have had considerable experience in distinguishing between direct actions that fall within the proviso and other actions against insurance companies that do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.067" offset="1654126">They correctly reasoned that direct action was used by Congress as a term of art to refer to a suit against an insurance company on a derivative liability, by which is meant that the cause of action asserted against the insurance company is one which could instead have been asserted against the... the insured.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.082" offset="2606133">That's correct, and there are many cases in the lower courts where there are suits on two-party insurance, say, against a fire insurer for failing to pay a claim, and the courts have said that is not a direct action.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.266" offset="2650855">It is something else, and they haven't given another label to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.843" offset="2661199">The statute applies by its terms not to direct actions generally, but to direct actions against insurance companies, and the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have split on the interpretation of that provision and the application of it to workers' compensation suits filed by insurers rather than against insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.397" offset="2743433">The Fifth Circuit has reasoned that the entire workers' compensation process must be treated as a claim by an insured worker against an insurance carrier to recover money, and has held in Campbell versus Insurance Company of North America that a workers' compensation suit by an insurance company is, in fact, the same thing as a workers' compensation suit against an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.450" offset="2831622">And the Court also reasoned that it would be unfair to deny a federal forum to an injured worker, but to afford that forum to an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.854" offset="2865268">The Sixth Circuit, on the other hand, in Aetna Life and Casualty Company versus Greene reasoned first, that there is nothing in the direct... in the legislative history of the direct action proviso to suggest its application to suits by insurers; second, that indeed, such suits do fall, unlike suits by injured workers, within the spirit and purpose of diversity jurisdiction; and, finally, that it would do unwarranted violence to the language used by Congress to say that a suit brought by an insurance company is, in fact, against the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.466" offset="2995671">And Congress had good reason to choose the phrase "against the insurance company" when drafting the direct action proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.462" offset="3023674">Where an injured worker files a suit, generally speaking, he is... files suit in the state in which he lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.537" offset="3055962">And if he chooses a federal court in preference to his own home state court, he does so for gratuitous reasons of litigation strategy unrelated to the purposes that the framers in the original Congress had in mind in enacting diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.343" offset="3115207">Direct actions brought by out-of-state insurers, on the other hand, partake of all the classical incidents of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.122" offset="3146345">They represent an attempt to avoid actual or perceived local bias in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.026" offset="3169960">Thus, the Fifth Circuit's focus in Campbell on the big picture was, we submit, a blurred focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.524" offset="3191903">The focus should not be on who filed the administrative claim or on who's seeking money from whom or on who bears the burden of proof, but it should be on who made the decision to bring this dispute in a federal court and on whether the likely reasons underlying that decision are in accord or in discord with the purposes of diversity jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.218" offset="4682659">And so as trite as it may sound, we filed the suit in federal court for all the traditional diversity jurisdiction reasons, to try and get a more neutral forum, one in which an out-of-state company could stand on an even footing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.314" offset="4975126">The issue for determination before the Court today is one of construction and one of interpretation... construction and interpretation, of course, of the direction action proviso to section 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.809" offset="5021101">It is the Respondents' contention that Fifth Circuit's construction of that proviso in the Campbell case is right and that the Sixth Circuit's construction of that proviso in the Greene case is wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.927" offset="5089542">It is consistent with the underlying Congressional intent regarding workers' compensation matters in general.</text>

            <text syncTime="2564.327" offset="10395116">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.263" offset="10406923">Although the matter is outside the record, I do feel the need to respond to Justice Marshall's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.870" offset="10429284">I have the Industrial Accident Board award before me, and it amounts to $56,723.99.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.289" offset="10458959">So, this case meets the $50,000 jurisdictional limitation, even though it was filed at a time when the limitation was only $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.692" offset="10488634">With respect to the character of workers' compensation insurance in Texas and its status as liability insurance, I certainly did not mean to hide the ball in my opening argument on that point because I believe it's wrapped up directly with the question of direct action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.982" offset="10553731">In fact if, indeed, liability insurance is an indemnity agreement and if, in fact, in the state of Texas an employer is never liable for workers' compensation benefits, then it follows that a Texas workers' compensation policy is not an indemnity agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.663" offset="10624471">It may protect the employer from other forms of liability for common law negligence, but it does not indemnify him for worker's compensation liability because he has no such liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.611" offset="10672223">And, for that reason, the key factor of the employer's non-liability goes to both the direct action question and to the question of liability insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.451" offset="10711615">Well, can't it be said that he has no liability unless he voluntarily subjects himself to some sort of scheme such as by buying the insurance in which case his liability is substituted by the insurance scheme?</text>

            <text syncTime="2666.988" offset="10805761">He may obligate the insurance company, but he does not obligate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.392" offset="10823419">And, if a workers' compensation insurer becomes insolvent in Texas, the employer does not become liable for those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.390" offset="10851423">Equally well, an employer could provide any other form of first-party insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.654" offset="10872425">For example, accident insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.732" offset="10880784">If I as an employer provide accident insurance for the benefit of my employees, no one would seriously argue that that was liability insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.587" offset="10912131">What workers' compensation insurance is in Texas is a specialized form of accident insurance protecting the employee for on-the-job injuries, even though the employer would not have been liable for those injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="2831.454" offset="11463628">But, Mr. Justice Stevens is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.436" offset="11475540">It may well be that the Fifth Circuit chose to merely adhere to its prior precedent unless and until overruled by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.168" offset="11502499">There is, indeed, a potential race to the courthouse, and it would be disingenuous to deny that such a thing could exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.243" offset="11530815">But that is an artifact, we submit, of Section 1445(c) which deprived the courts of removal jurisdiction but left the original jurisdiction unaffected in workers' compensation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.412" offset="11579508">And that is true irrespective of what this court does here today with the direct action proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.846" offset="11601242">In a suit where the employer, the employee and the insurance carrier are all diverse from one another, that suit may be filed by either party in the federal court system, notwithstanding the direct action proviso, but may not be removed to that court by any party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.464" offset="11671668">And so, 1445(c) creates that race to the courthouse irrespective of the circumstances of the direct action provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.367" offset="11703328">Finally, on the issue of clogging federal dockets, I regret that we did not have modern statistics for the Court, but in the 1958 legislative history, the Court did have... the Congress, excuse me, did have before it the relative frequency of filing of workers' compensation suits in federal courts by insurance carriers in the state of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.248" offset="11790786">And those statistics reveal as of that year when the jurisdictional amount was only $3,000 that less than &lt;two&gt; [= 2] percent of the workers' compensation cases heard in the Texas federal courts were filed there originally by insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.665" offset="11848464">So, I think that the fears of overburdened federal dockets are largely ephemeral fears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.053" offset="11869989">In any event, this court held in the Meredith versus City of Winterhaven case that diversity jurisdiction does not exist for the court's convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.642" offset="11908442">It exists for the protection of the litigants in those cases that fall within the spirit and intent of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.468" offset="11935713">This is one of those cases, and we, therefore, respectfully urge that the Fifth Circuit be reversed.</text>
