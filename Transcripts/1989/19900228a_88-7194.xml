            <label>Mr. Bruce D. Livingston</label>
            <text syncTime="24.008" offset="247065">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="27.679" offset="261694">This case involves the statutory interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 924(e), which provides for a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 15 years without parole to persons found in violation of Section 922(g) of that Title and who have three previous convictions for a violent felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.484" offset="344972">A violent felony under that statute is defined as a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year and for purposes of this case is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives or otherwise presents a risk of serious... serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.560" offset="437237">In the district court, for purposes of facts of this case, the court relied upon four felony convictions, two of which we do not contest, but two of which were burglary second-degree under Missouri law, which we contend were not within the definition of violent felony under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.066" offset="519261">The Eighth Circuit affirmed that holding and affirmed a 15-year sentence, holding that anything labeled burglary under any state law fell within the definition of violent felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.243" offset="571924">The sole issue, as far as we can ascertain, is whether the definition should give effect to the statutory language and limited definition to burglaries which present a serious potential risk of physical injury or whether a definition which was repealed from the predecessor statute, the 1984 act, should be given effect as the government argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.199" offset="667741">As applied to Petitioner, if those second-degree burglaries are found to present a risk of injury, then he would have been properly sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.247" offset="707970">Otherwise, he should be given a new sentence, reversed and remanded so that he would be given a maximum term of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.632" offset="733465">In the abstract, the term "burglary" in the statute is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.425" offset="756662">There are a large number of definitions for that term starting, first, I think, with the common law definition which is the breaking and entering of a dwelling place in the night time.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.164" offset="807653">There are numerous other definitions, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.226" offset="819878">Only about five... as many as... forms of common law burglary, maybe six or seven states have that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.131" offset="847463">And there are many, many varying definitions of burglary among the other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.236" offset="871914">I... I take it that something might not qualify as burglary under Roman numeral ii, but might qualify as presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to another?</text>

            <text syncTime="195.646" offset="933563">Insofar as there may be a vagueness problem with the term burglary, it is possible, I believe, to find some crimes which could be labeled something other than burglary, or maybe be burglary and, if you ruled out the definition entirely, you could still get it under a catch-all definition as conduct that presents a risk of physical injury to others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.498" offset="6325028">Congress, however, did not further define the term burglary, as it did in the predecessor 1984 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.843" offset="6350314">The narrow question presented here is whether Petitioner's Missouri burglary convictions are violent felonies under the 1986 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.728" offset="6377899">But in order to resolve that question, the Court must first decide what Congress meant by the term 2 of Section 924(e)(2)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.648" offset="6429622">But as it turns out, getting to the bottom of the first inquiry, effectively resolves the second issue of statutory construction and ultimately the question presented in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.233" offset="13207875">First, I note... Note 8 of the government's brief, they indicate several places where there are the use of the common law burglary or other statutes different than their interpretation for the term "burglary".</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.164" offset="13267643">Second, I think this is a plain language case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.106" offset="13283421">More than anything, although the legislative history supports us, in a response to Justice Scalia's question about the comma or about "or otherwise" modifying "involves use of explosives", I think that the comma after "involves use of explosives" and before "or otherwise" precludes that interpretation and it's just as likely that it could be interrupted to modify the entire portion of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.932" offset="13386761">May I ask you one question that's very important to me?</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.195" offset="13395748">That... in your view of elements supposing your client had been charged with a crime, whatever the definition we end up with, that fit the definition but the statute in the state involved permitted conviction for a broader category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.825" offset="13450291">Do you say you look at the charging papers or you look at the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.498" offset="13581008">I also would like to address Justice White's question about expanding the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.412" offset="13608593">I think it is important, and we made the point in our reply brief, and I think the legislative history definitely supports us in this regard, that although the change from 1984 to 1986 expanded the act... which it undeniably did; it added all of the various crimes... it used to just be robbery and burglary and they expanded it to get murder, rape, mayhem, whatever else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.038" offset="13691140">But there was a great deal of debate about excluding property crimes and, specifically, burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.153" offset="13711620">And what we have here now is a definition where I believe--</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.713" offset="13777867">I also think that it's very clear that the government definition that's proposed is not an ordinary or contemporary definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.989" offset="13814961">It's a subset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.850" offset="13818409">Somehow or other it will reach the various burglary crimes across this country, but it is not the burglary crime themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.497" offset="13856966">They are very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.268" offset="13860100">And it clearly omits any consideration of the very, very narrow burglary crimes which we... it's our position... are really what Congress was intending and that's the aggravated burglaries and the violent burglaries, the higher degrees of burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.218" offset="13919868">Nothing in the government's definition addresses that distinction and all of those other statutes that are out there and are also called burglary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.793" offset="14002206">We have stated in our brief that extortion, particularly is problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.908" offset="14034598">I think you might be able to somehow, when you're defining what's a risk of injury, maybe arson seems to be a kind of crime that has a risk of injury, and I wouldn't contest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.893" offset="14074513">It is not an issue here to day anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.265" offset="14080051">Extortion, Justice O'Connor's example, is a very good one of the kind of extortion that doesn't present a risk of injury and I think it's very appropriate that that not be an enhancing offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.392" offset="14124564">It's not the same as, hey, give me some money or I'll shoot or kill your child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.915" offset="14138670">That's the kind of extortion that was meant, not, hey, I'm going to tell some nasty stories about you if you don't give me some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.641" offset="14173570">That's not a risk of injury, and I would think there's a difference between those two kinds of extortion.</text>
