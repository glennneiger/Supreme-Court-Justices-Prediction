            <label>Ms. Bonita L. Kneeland</label>
            <text syncTime="18.623" offset="215874">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.364" offset="226845">This case involves an auto accident in which a group of migrant workers who were being transported to the fields, at which time the van in which they were being transported tipped over because a tire blew and they were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.068" offset="309706">The workers were compensated through workers' compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.844" offset="336768">However, after that point, they also brought suit against the employer based on allegations that the employer had violated safety provisions in the Migrant Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, which is sometimes known as MSAWPA or AWPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.966" offset="413255">Since the court below used the term AWPA, that is the one I will use.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.342" offset="434780">The AWPA violations, as to the infractions that allegedly caused body... bodily injury were never proved because the case was resolved in the Middle District of Florida by way of a... a partial summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.333" offset="510744">The Middle District of Florida, looking at the incorporation or the addition of the workers' compensation remedy into the act and the Department of Labor's regulation making that the exclusive remedy in cases of bodily injury, the... the Middle District gave a summary judgment to Adams Fruit on those bodily injury claims, as well as the claims for statutory fines and injunctive relief in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.987" offset="661418">What the Middle District did then is swing the pendulum in one direction completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.972" offset="689317">In the Eleventh Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit swung the pendulum back completely in another direction and reinstated everything to the migrant workers, not simply entitlement to sue under the statute to enforce the safety provisions by way of penalties or injunctive relief, but also to make workers' compensation only the first step in a two-step process where they could stack a liability claim for bodily injury damages under the act above and beyond the workers' compensation relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.697" offset="844171">And we are here today to argue the narrow issue that perhaps both courts swung too far in either direction, and this Court should make the pendulum right again.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.925" offset="889101">The narrow issue, as I said, is that when workers' compensation is provided, as set up by the act itself, whether AWPA intended to operate workers' compensation as it normally would operate, as a no-fault recovery, in return for being the exclusive remedy for bodily injury claims... BI claims or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.831" offset="988785">Our position in this Court is that we are not advocating to this Court that the migrant workers may not sue to get penalties or injunctive relief under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.591" offset="1035805">We are simply saying that the bodily injury claims were recovered by way of workers' compensation and that is not part of a two-step remedy that can be stacked.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.910" offset="5941079">There were... according to the August 1983 Federal Register, there was no opposition recorded or no comments about it to the... to the extent that it was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.586" offset="5987786">And now... all along for 18 months migrant workers' groups were actively involved in the drafting of the statute and actively there for every step of the way as it was brought together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.205" offset="6038254">It would appear that and... and if this was an error on the Department of Labor's part, or something beyond the scope of what they were entitled to do, that would have certainly raised a... a tremendous surge of opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.767" offset="6104501">In fact, this regulation has been on the books for nearly seven years, and it is only recently that someone has challenged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.972" offset="6141281">I'm sorry... I take that back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.645" offset="6147968">The... the actual regulation has only been challenged once, but there is one other case, the Roman case, where actual damages where attempted to be recovered in addition to workers' compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.504" offset="6199482">What... what we're trying to say here is that the... the drafters had a purpose for putting workers' compensation in as an alterative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.752" offset="6240442">And it certainly would not have been telling the farmers that they can drop their liability policies and count on their workers' compensation because I don't believe they would have meant to hang the farmer out to dry like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.091" offset="6289761">They certainly, if they were... if this was meant to afford additional protections to the migrant worker above and beyond workers' compensation, they could have required comp, if it's available, and a liability policy above and beyond that to compensate the workers for additional damages if they brought claims for actual damages through the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.258" offset="6390489">However, these workers are not deprived of their remedy under 1854.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.344" offset="6410760">They can sue to enforce the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.784" offset="6420582">And if that means equitable relief or penalties, then... then so be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.120" offset="6441898">It is where we come to bodily injury claims that it is obvious that a group of people who got together and who in... in FLCRA, the previous bill, had never permitted the substitution of workers' compensation... and this is the substitution of the remedy... determined that they would indeed substitute that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.634" offset="6527998">And what we have now are workers, migrant workers, who are compensated across the board immediately for their injuries in all phases on the job, anytime they are hurt, because they have the workers' compensation remedy at their disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.656" offset="6592050">Well, the quid pro quo of that is that the farmer wants to have workers' compensation too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.112" offset="6621830">He wants this to be a remedy, an alternate remedy obviously under AWPA because, number one, he would not be brought into court all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.571" offset="6667701">Even if he proved to be totally void of committing any violations, he would have to hire an attorney and go to court and so on and so forth, and we have what amounts to a Federal tort suit then, above and beyond every workers' compensations claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.642" offset="6727991">We have 19 states where the employer can elect workers' compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.476" offset="6755368">In, I believe it's 15 of the states, that's part of the statute, and in four other states, it is just permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.923" offset="6785147">Nineteen states where tomorrow the farm employer could say, well, I am not getting anything back from my workers' compensation policies and paying my premiums.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.000" offset="7581464">Congress expressly created and rather carefully delimited the private right of action involved in this case after hearing some quite dramatic testimony about actual damages in a disaster in Blythe, California where about 50 migrants were maimed or killed in the crash of a single unsafe vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.866" offset="7664847">Now, there was workers' comp available there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.508" offset="7671430">California was the most generous of the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.482" offset="7695358">But for better or for worse, Congress indisputably concluded that workers' compensation was an inadequate remedy and the House report makes absolutely plain what the language of 1854's predecessor made plain anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.473" offset="7755335">That was that they thought an unfettered Federal civil remedy was indispensable if the law was to work--</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.720" offset="7844256">It seems to me one could take the view that its a bad fit, that Congress sometimes makes mistakes and that it's not for this Court or for the Secretary of Labor to rewrite the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.565" offset="7927639">They tried in 1978 to actually make workers' compensation the exclusive remedy in what was called the Ireland bill, Representative Ireland of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.104" offset="7969853">And the language of that provision would have been quite explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.816" offset="7984690">They were worried not just about being hit with double insurance premiums but being hit with double liability and may be not having an offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.194" offset="8018231">And so the language of that provision specifically talks about the exclusive remedy provisions of state workers' comp and would have incorporated that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.121" offset="8309862">But that doesn't meet anyone's belief that if they have that insurance, and they are told you needn't get anymore, that there will never be liability over and above it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.987" offset="8349359">Here the idea was that as business enterprises, agribusiness should have the freedom to decide to have lower premiums and to gamble on an occasional big payout, which is what would happen if they chose to rest with workers' comp as the exclusive insurance coverage they would obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.822" offset="8432742">If the whole purpose of Congress was as suggested by Petitioner, namely, a kind of promise to the employer that they will be immune from any uninsured liability, then I think it would be incomprehensible, and it would be a much worse fit, because, as Justice Stevens points out, that's not what farmers get here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.757" offset="8516439">In, let's say, the 14 states where there is no workers' compensation for migrants, and in the other seven states where migrants are almost totally excluded, what happens is that if an employer purchases all the insurance that he is required under this law to obtain... and he is required under the law and the regs to have at least as much as the Interstate Commerce Act specifies... he still is exposed to liability over and above that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.305" offset="8626675">It's not a senseless fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.097" offset="8633781">It makes perfect sense in other areas of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.841" offset="8648827">And even if I assume, and I am quite prepared to, that given the precise wording of the Ireland amendment, it too wouldn't have really achieved the extreme purpose of subordinating the Federal liability remedy to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.844" offset="8716850">That amendment was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.297" offset="8730643">What we have is something that even if I assume it's equivalent was at most the Ireland amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.409" offset="8755093">We do not, however, have anything in the statute which departs from the normal tradition by subordinating the Federal to a state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.326" offset="8802741">Now, when Congress wants to do that, it does it in very specific terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.091" offset="8821758">The Black Lung Act, about which this Court heard argument just yesterday, was a perfect example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.046" offset="8845581">That gives the Secretary of Labor the role of administering the Federal payout, the Federal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.381" offset="8874943">It's not done through judicial action, but it's done through the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.274" offset="8890512">So, he has some business there and there would be a way to enforce any rules he made about it because he is the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.588" offset="8915799">And then it tells him... the act of Congress tells him to relegate the mine workers to state workers' compensation if he finds that the state... the state system provides adequate compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.819" offset="8972746">When Congress wants to do that, it knows how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.069" offset="8985702">It did it in Black Lung.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.760" offset="8988419">It did it in a slightly different way, as we point out in our brief, in the Federal Tort Claims Act and in the War Hazards Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.695" offset="9016213">But every court that has reviewed a Federal statute which does not incorporate in its language an exclusive state remedy... such as, for example, the Jones Act or the Longshoremen's Act... has understood that the background rule against which Congress is writing is a rule which says that the Federal remedy that you provide is supplementary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.826" offset="9136690">There may be an offset, but it is not suppose to have a hole carved out of it in every place where a state remedy might be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.513" offset="9167515">And when that hole is carved, as it was in the Black Lung Act, it's typically carved in a way that gives the Secretary the responsibility of deciding whether the state remedy to which the worker would be relegated is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.755" offset="9224461">It would be extraordinary to decide that regardless of the adequacy or inadequacy of state workers' compensation, when it is provided then the Federal remedy evaporates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.912" offset="9277124">And that is what this free-floating regulation says, the regulation, which is untethered, as Justice Scalia pointed out, to any responsibility that the Secretary of Labor has in administering this law, completely unhinged from any of his functions in standard setting or in investigation or in registration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2648.919" offset="10737056">There were 116 cases listed in the September 1982 hearings involving personal injuries resulting from unsafe vehicles, some of them overturning and migrants drowning in two feet of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.812" offset="10872684">You couldn't go after the agribusiness, the ultimate employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.196" offset="10890238">And because you couldn't, it was very difficult to obtain judgments, and exploitation continued.</text>

            <text syncTime="2809.908" offset="11381026">He said that... and this is the way it's handled in many other areas, like Longshoremen's and others... he said that it is perfectly appropriate for the district court in deciding what actual damages were suffered to take into account the fact that they had collected something like $120,000 among the... among the... I think ten of them... from the Workers' Compensation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.917" offset="11489069">We're not suggesting anything like the double dipping or double recovery that Petitioner suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.689" offset="11512161">But what we are suggesting is that when Congress goes out of its way to empower a group of workers, not by giving them Cadillacs, by giving them access to Federal court, and when Congress expressly says that they can collect damages in that Federal court, it is not up to the Secretary of Labor in a pronouncement about a part of a statute that he doesn't administer, to rewrite what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.348" offset="11614770">And indeed, you know, as I think about it, this Court is being asked to rewrite, not only AWPA, but the DOL regulation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.534" offset="11651550">Because if I hear her correctly, Ms. Kneeland is now retreating from the position of her original brief, and she is now saying that, well, perhaps you shouldn't really reinstate what the district court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.292" offset="11706617">You should cut it down the middle... she describes it in terms of setting the pendulum right... and what you should do is allow the suit for statutory damages, which could still by the way, be more than was covered by insurance, could still cripple the farmer, which leaves very little sense in their reading of 1841(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.359" offset="12270861">In '74 when the cause of action was put in place, there was an interesting colloquy between the head of Wages and Hours in Labor and Representative Ford, essentially the patron saint of the migrant worker community in Congress since 1974, in which the Department of Labor was asked, aren't you better off with this private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.675" offset="12360096">Doesn't it take some of the burden off of you?</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.846" offset="12384860">There's no reason for Labor to resist having this private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.711" offset="12404295">It does make it somewhat mysterious why the regulation was promulgated, but not so mysterious why the Solicitor General is not here and why the Department of Labor hasn't defended this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.348" offset="12442852">That is, this is not something that relates to the Labor Department's responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.673" offset="12464168">If this regulation is disregarded as obviously ultra vires, it doesn't interfere with any day-to-day responsibility of the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.649" offset="12500008">It doesn't increase their burdens one bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.332" offset="12506799">It simply carries out what Congress chose to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.013" offset="12517457">And in this statute, Congress was very specific about the relationships between Federal and state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.218" offset="12542326">It said that state law would not be fully preempted, because 1871 says that states can add responsibilities on top of the Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.013" offset="12585480">It specifically absorbed one defense from state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.686" offset="12600213">Namely, if you're defined as a labor organization under state law, then you can't be sued under this private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.772" offset="12628530">In addition to that, it empowers the Secretary to delegate administrative functions to state agencies in Section 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.758" offset="12664475">But it says that the Secretary of Labor shall not delegate rule-making authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.872" offset="12684955">In other words, AWPA clearly spells out a certain model of cooperative Federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.087" offset="12709823">And that model bears no resemblance to the wholesale absorption of state law which is accomplished by this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.963" offset="12745245">And you notice not only is the Solicitor General not here, the State of Florida is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.445" offset="12763217">Florida, like other states, does not purport to treat the exclusivity of workers' comp as bearing on your right to recover from another legal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.481" offset="12799371">That was the holding of a Supreme Court of Florida in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.004" offset="12813477">And this Court, in the context of the full faith in credit clause, reached a similar conclusion in Thomas v. Washington Gas Light in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.560" offset="12843675">That is perhaps why the States of Texas, California and Massachusetts, which are the only states this Court has heard from, have basically taken the position that what the Secretary of Labor did was to create a kind of hybrid chimerical contraption which had no resemblance to what the states wanted to, and which in fact hijacked the states' laws, turned them to a purpose the states didn't have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.065" offset="12945657">They weren't trying to kick people out of Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.468" offset="12955270">So the current posture this Court is asked to accept far from a perfect position of a pendulum, involves righting a very strange hybrid law, that would not be recognized as Florida's choice, or as Congress' choice or perhaps even as the choice of the current Secretary of Labor, which it seems to me is not a Federal judicial responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.655" offset="13132066">Their examples in the first two footnotes of their reply brief where they talk about Texas and Florida, somehow suggest that states really are going to be pressured one way or the other by the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.202" offset="13178251">But the fact is that Texas, which they give as their initial example, has come before this Court in its amicus brief to say that it wants to have the supplementary availability of Federal relief for migrant workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.802" offset="13232586">Now, of course, if the Federal relief is withdrawn... the relief that Congress provided... states might be under pressure to do all sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.246" offset="13262365">But that would be a reason to cut back for the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.983" offset="13301340">So I say that if it's a small farm that's the defendant, and if the migrants are not hurt beyond a level of $20,000, and I'll set that as a minimum, the Federal cause of action should be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.883" offset="13352958">That would put a lot of pressure on the states.</text>
