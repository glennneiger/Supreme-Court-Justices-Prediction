            <label>Mr. Brent Lawson English</label>
            <text syncTime="192.224" offset="907590">Your Honor, I would say that that is a fundamental aspect of the question of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.928" offset="922427">If something cannot be proved true or false, I would suggest to the Court that it could be properly labeled as opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.564" offset="944997">However, as Justice O'Connor has just mentioned, it may not be necessary in this area of the law to even adopt any kind of opinion privilege if we require a defamation plaintiff to affirmatively prove falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.805" offset="997974">But in this case, the allegation is that Mr. Milkovich lied under oath in a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.426" offset="1024410">That is quintessentially an assertion of fact which, if false, should be actionable under the state law of defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.965" offset="1054607">However, certain statements, which are very rhetorical or hyperbolic or polemical, which cannot be proved true or false, could easily be characterized as opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.455" offset="1096507">However, it is the petitioner's judgement that this Court need not reach that question in this case, since based on the Hepps case, Mr. Milkovich can demonstrate his entitlement to at least a jury determination on the question of whether or not this... these statements were true or false, and unquestionably they were defamatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.269" offset="1179786">Your Honors, as I have pointed out in my brief, there are many instances in the past twenty years, after this Court's decision in Gertz v. Robert Welch, were courts have presumed that there is a broad First Amendment based privilege in the law of defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.030" offset="1238823">As a result of that presumption, and this Court has never so held, there have been many courts that have developed a series of different formulations as to how that distinction should be made, whether something is an assertion of fact or whether something is a expression of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.437" offset="1296501">Most courts have relied first on the question of whether or not a statement is objectively verifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.457" offset="1320534">And as I have pointed out in this instance, this statement is unequivocally objectively verifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.178" offset="1343417">This is not a situation like, for example, the case Buckley v. Littell decided by the Second Circuit where there was a statement that William F. Buckley was a, quote, "fellow fascist traveler".</text>
            <text syncTime="312.086" offset="1387094">In that case, the Second Circuit looked at that language and said there is no way that that statement can be in fact verifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.475" offset="1420635">It is loosely defined words.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.261" offset="1427740">It is polemical, it is political in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.894" offset="1438294">And as a result, that statement is not defamatory, or even if defamatory, is not actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.147" offset="1459296">However, in the same case, Mr. Buckley was also accused to having committed plagiarism.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.584" offset="1481030">And the Second Circuit analyzed that question and said that, very much like perjury or an allegation of perjury, is definitely empirically provable, clearly is defamatory, and therefore should be actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.959" offset="1526587">So the Second Circuit has certainly recognized that there is an opinion privilege, but that opinion privilege only applies in the area where there is very polemical language, hyperbolae being utilized, and where in context the statement cannot be objectively verified.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.088" offset="1595028">In this case, Your Honors, the respondents have contended that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide this case on the grounds that the Ohio Supreme Court has determined that there is an opinion privilege under the Ohio constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.263" offset="1655737">They cite the case of Michigan v. Long, decided by this Court in 1983, for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.451" offset="1676530">I would like to address that question directly because I think it's important in the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.386" offset="1696279">The procedural history of this case is somewhat unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.838" offset="1706101">It has had 15 years of litigation in Ohio's courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.623" offset="1717177">There have been three attempts to bring this case to the attention of the United States Supreme Court, the latest and presumably only successful one, being the one sought be the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.596" offset="1757092">In Michigan v. Long this Court held that where a state court has unequivocally determined an issue on separate adequate and independent state grounds, this Court does not have jurisdiction to decide the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.388" offset="1808292">However, in this case, the decision from which the appeal is taken is from the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Appellate District, and not from the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.778" offset="1845804">And the decision of the Ohio Court of Appeals from the Eleventh Appellate District relies nearly exclusively on Federal precedent and also relies on the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in the accompanying Scott case.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.319" offset="1895959">As the Court is aware, the Ohio Supreme Court in... in a period of yet... just 15 months has determined, on one hand, that the statements in question in this case are constitutionally protected as opinion under the First Amendment, and then 15 months later determined that the very same statements under the very same facts, but with a different plaintiff, are in fact constitutionally protected or immunized by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.553" offset="2000867">The Ohio Supreme Court did in fact mention on two occasions in its... in its decision that it was relying in part on the Ohio constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.892" offset="2034303">However, any fair reading of the Scott case clearly indicates that the Ohio Supreme Court was primarily relying on this Court's decision on Gertz against Robert Welch, decided in 1974, and the veritable flood of cases that have been decided since, presuming that there is this broad First Amendment-based privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.305" offset="2115910">Therefore--</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.776" offset="10753768">I'd like to address the last point that Mr. Panza just made because I think it is a complete misstatement of the facts and the law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.798" offset="10785846">The Ohio Supreme Court on December 31, 1984 made a determination in this case that Mike Milkovich was not a public figure and not a public official and that this statement was not constitutionally protected as opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.474" offset="10844570">That is the law of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.757" offset="10853765">There has not been a determination by any other court since that time that Mike Milkovich is not a public figure and not a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.847" offset="10886052">The respondents would have this Court believe that somehow the Ohio Supreme Court, by deciding the Scott case, has somehow sub silentio overruled it's prior decision with respect to Mr. Milkovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.771" offset="10933804">Mr. Milkovich's status--</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.757" offset="10937774">But it did... it did come out a different way in Scott on some issues than it did in the Milkovich case, didn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.909" offset="10958359">--Without a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.827" offset="10962016">With respect to the opinion question, there has been a complete flip-flop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.113" offset="10975182">The decision was four to three in the Milkovich case in favor of making the article actionable, i.e., an assertion of fact, and it was four to three in the Scott case just 15 months later after two judges on the Ohio Supreme Court left the Court and two new judges joined the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.588" offset="11041010">There have been now new judges elected to the Ohio Supreme Court, and it's unclear, certainly, as to what might happen with this question unless this Court definitively decides that this article is not constitutionally protected as opinion.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="2740.748" offset="11101719">We couldn't decide it for the... under the... we couldn't decide what the Ohio Constitution requires or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.606" offset="11141112">That is correct, Your Honor, you could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.740" offset="11145709">However, going to that question with the Michigan v. Long analysis of separate adequate independent state grounds, as Justice Scalia pointed out, the decision from which the appeal is being taken is from the Ohio Court of Appeals, and there is a specific determination there that the court is relying on Federal precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.434" offset="11216449">Clearly, the Ohio Supreme Court, again, as Justice Stevens pointed out, depends on the syllabus in the opinion, and the syllabus no way mentions that the case is grounded either in whole or in part on the Ohio constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.761" offset="11273709">Every justice of the Ohio Supreme Court wrote on the Scott case, and all but one of the concurring judges in the majority cited the Federal Constitution as being the source for the opinion privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.957" offset="11358555">I have one last question, or one last point on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.959" offset="11370571">Mr. Panza has continued to note here that the issue is not what Mr. Diadiun intended but, rather, what the average reasonable newspaper reader perceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.248" offset="11407665">And I would agree with that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.250" offset="11411740">However, in his next breath he says Mr. Diadiun really didn't intend to say that Mike Milkovich committed the crime of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.004" offset="11438698">The relevant constitutional inquiry should be how is an average reader perceiving the article, as Justice O'Connor pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.941" offset="11470463">And on that score, a reasonable construction of the article in this case can lead to but no other reasonable conclusion than that Mr. Milkovich was accused of a crime under Ohio law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.231" offset="11515603">But do you think that's the test rather than verifiability?</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.817" offset="11525947">I think that verifiability obviously will... will get us past that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.302" offset="11539949">But if, for instance, there is a reasonable dispute as to whether verifiability is in question... in other words, we have a mixed question of opinion and fact... then the relevant inquiry should be how does the average reader perceive the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2862.612" offset="11589164">Is that an issue that's submitted to the jury, the perception of the average reader?</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent Lawson English</label>
            <text syncTime="2868.131" offset="11611211">Your Honor, I believe it is a question reasonably left to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.699" offset="11621451">There is no reasonable justification for making it a legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.018" offset="11634826">It's not like the determination of whether an individuals a public figure or public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.221" offset="11651544">But, rather, it goes to how did a reasonable reader perceive this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.240" offset="11663665">And what better group to make that decision then a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.625" offset="11677249">And I would submit to the Court that, in this, case since there was a jury demand, the jury could easily make that determination and decide whether or not Mr. Diadiun's intent or the average perception of the newspaper... or the newspaper audience, was whether he accused Mr. Milkovich of perjury or merely was stating this as his alleged opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.406" offset="11764289">For all of the reasons I've mentioned, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court reverse the decision of the Ohio Court of Appeals and return this case for trial.</text>
