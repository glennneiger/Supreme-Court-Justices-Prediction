            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145486">We'll hear argument first this afternoon on No. 88-1476, C. T. Carden v. Arkoma Associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.978" offset="193342">Mr. Ingolia, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard K. Ingolia</label>
            <text syncTime="13.140" offset="198044">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.065" offset="217688">The Fifth Circuit held that in determining the presence or absence of diversity jurisdiction in a case involving a limited partnership it would consider only the citizenship of the general partners as being relevant to the determination of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.594" offset="291772">If the citizenship of the general partners and that of the opposing parties was diverse, the Fifth Circuit regards jurisdiction as having been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.563" offset="339733">They are wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.877" offset="356973">First, the decision conflicts with the Supreme Court precedent in Navarro and Great Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.510" offset="379439">Second, instead of consulting the appropriate state law, which in this case is Arizona, it ignored that law, which is contrary to the Erie decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.770" offset="436490">And lastly, it ignored the interests of the limited partners who owned 99 percent of the partnership and in effect held that they had no interest in the outcome of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.236" offset="482361">Now, the rationale adopted by this Court in Navarro pointed out that it had never made an analogy between a trust and a business organization for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.548" offset="559579">That is what the Fifth Circuit is doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.021" offset="569506">In addition, they did not take into consideration the differences between a trust and a limited partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.200" offset="626244">Principally, in a trust 100 percent of the legal ownership is vested in the trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.655" offset="660098">The beneficiaries have no legal ownership at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.079" offset="677757">In a limited partnership, the general partners have only management of the entity and that ownership which they either pay for or earn by virtue of their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.760" offset="740451">They do not own 100 percent of the assets of the partnership, as do the trustees in an express trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.125" offset="773888">And even the question of management in this case was not entirely vested in the limited partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.184" offset="818191">Twenty percent of the... on the general partners, pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.036" offset="837626">Twenty percent of the limited partners could prevent the sale of the assets of the partnership and the limiteds could also prevent the reinvestment in drilling rigs, which were the only assets of the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.048" offset="901574">That condition does not exist in the trust situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.502" offset="923413">At least since the time of the decision in Great Southern v. Jones, this Court has maintained that a limited partnership's citizenship is determined by that of all of the members of the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.555" offset="1015677">There is no distinction made on a jurisdictional basis... on a jurisdictional basis by distinguishing between the classes of partnership.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.867" offset="1076908">It based its decision entirely on their decision in the Mesa case, Mesa v. Louisiana Interstate Pipeline.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.544" offset="1131661">Did you cite the Great Southern in your case... in your brief to the Fifth Circuit?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_k_ingolia" startTime="250.608" stopTime="447.080">
            <label>Mr. Richard K. Ingolia</label>
            <text syncTime="250.608" offset="1147857">Yes, we did, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.977" offset="1153290">The Fifth Circuit is apparently of the opinion that... imagine that this opinion arose from the Colonial Realty Case decided in the Second Circuit, which was based on Section 26 of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.256" offset="1254436">In that case, Judge Friendly, I believe, as the argument of the court, held that he would not consider the citizenship of the limited partners because Section 26 of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act provided that they were not proper parties to a suit unless their own interests were before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.268" offset="1342521">I think that conflicts with what this Court has said in Navarro, particularly in its footnote 9 where it compared the decision in United Steelworkers case to, I believe it was Section 17(a) of Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.261" offset="1426426">They pointed out that while, yes, it's true that perhaps a labor union may file suit in its name and it is a real party at interest, but that's a question separate and apart from diversity jurisdiction, determined based solely on the membership of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.099" offset="1517855">It not having been incorporated, the court concluded that it must consider the citizenship of all members of the union in arriving at a decision on the question of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.912" offset="1585042">One of the interesting things done in the United Steelworkers case was this Court distinguished the earlier Puerto Rico case where, in that case, a civil law, sociedad en comandita, as they referred to it, was considered to have jurisdiction of the... of Puerto Rico because it was created under Puerto Rico law... Puerto Rican law, rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.385" offset="1726939">In Puerto Rico, as in any other civilian jurisdiction, a partnership is a juridical person and has been for centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.973" offset="1777303">They would not extend that principle... or, this Court would not extend that principle to the labor union case, because the labor union was not something created under a system of law providing for judicial... juridical personality being vested in the labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.206" offset="1850237">I suggest that the same reasoning should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.329" offset="1866746">The partnership at issue is an Arizona partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.853" offset="1888898">Therefore, it's a common law partnership and the Great Southern case should cover that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.319" offset="1922753">It decided the issue against diversity.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="447.080" offset="1933724">Is it clear that that business organization under the Puerto Rican law was a... was a legal person?</text>

            <text syncTime="457.915" offset="1977088">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.588" offset="1983775">I assume that the laws of Puerto Rico are similar to those of Louisiana and their common civilian heritage provides that a partnership is a juridical person, as a corporation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.788" offset="2048559">That provision is absent in Arizona law.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.311" offset="2066635">The Arizona courts hold that a partnership is not a juridical person; it's a collection of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.594" offset="2095788">I suggest that that is the law that should have been followed because the court was sitting in a diversity case and it should have felt itself bound by the Erie decision and its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.434" offset="2147197">It did not do so, but it did feel that it would maintain the position that it had taken in the two previous cases it had decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.990" offset="2237372">The court was sitting in Louisiana, but it had to apply Arizona law in determining the nature of the entity before it, an Arizona limited partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.618" offset="2291915">It cannot apply the Louisiana law to an Arizona partnership any more than an Arizona court would apply Louisiana law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.266" offset="10194479">The partnership... limited partnership... is a juridical person... and I hesitate to use that word... but it is an entity that can own property according to the state statues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.765" offset="10236484">That entity owns the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.967" offset="10249336">In this case, the oil rigs, the drilling rigs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.627" offset="10255919">The entity owned them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.079" offset="10261770">The limited partners simply are like shareholders; they are equitable or beneficial owners of an interest in this business that this business does own some property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.495" offset="10299386">So, no, they don't have any of their direct assets at stake except for their financial investment as a shareholder, as any kind of investor has in a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.502" offset="10339406">And I liken this to, if you back up in time to 1957 before Congress enacted the revision of 1332(c)... 28 U.S.C. 1332(c)... that this Court... it was a jurisprudential decision that excepted corporations from the general rule as to complete diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.134" offset="10421953">And this Court back in 1840 and then affirmed in 1850 with the Letson case and the Marshall v.

            <text syncTime="2589.267" offset="10502515">Now, I submit that you could do the same at this juncture, although I'm not saying that that is the best way to handle this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.752" offset="10528428">I do believe consistent with the opinion in Navarro where you look to the real parties to the controversy and decided that the trustees in that case who managed the litigation... they held equitable title, they had full control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.933" offset="10593212">The beneficial title, meanwhile, was always in the beneficiaries and not in the trustees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.291" offset="10894560">And I would suggest that it could be done, but then, again, I think the stronger position for this Court consistent with the whole line of cases that have come up over the years is to look at the real parties to the controversy and see who they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.252" offset="10950462">And then it becomes a factual analysis which this Court was willing to do in Navarro and say, okay, the trust beneficiaries hold this, this and this powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.757" offset="10992467">And we're going to look at that, but we don't think that those are the kind of powers you want to look to to decide whether they are the real parties to the controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.909" offset="11249094">So, other than the juridical person idea comes up I think in a faulty context because nobody has ever really asked this Court to assume or to hold that for diversity jurisdiction purposes this limited partnerships or all limited partnerships should be... should be considered an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.830" offset="11320774">If I may get back just one bit to the Navarro case, I find it odd that this Court would put its entire holding in a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.429" offset="11363197">If this Court intended to say that the Navarro analysis of real parties to the controversy was not to apply to any other entity, I would believe that you'd put it in the main part of the decision as opposed to a footnote 9 which simply says that we have never up until now analogized the limited partner... or the business trust to other forms of business entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.774" offset="11448565">It didn't even mention limited partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.554" offset="11455670">Justice Blackmun, on the other hand, in the dissent, indicated that he found it troublesome that the Court didn't take the affirmative step and say, hey, this is just like a limited partnership; this is just like other business entities that are out in the commercial world in the 1980s and say take the bull by the horns and decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.846" offset="11528813">Well, the issue wasn't exactly in front of the Court at that time because you were dealing with a business trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.729" offset="11548353">But I dare say the analysis... the five, eight pages of analysis... that you went through would... would not have been necessary had it not been for an opinion of this court or a feeling of this court that the real party to the controversy analysis ought to be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.997" offset="11605404">And I say that because in that Navarro case, a case of Chappadulane, I think... and I may be mispronouncing it... back in 1808 firmly held that that trustees of a trust were the real parties and the citizenship of those trustees were the ones... was the citizenship that counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.217" offset="11666322">So you wouldn't have had to go through a difficult analysis if you were simply going to rely on that old case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.733" offset="11692340">Obviously, it seems to me that because the discussion went on that you did feel that the real parties to the controversy analysis ought to be maintained at least now and then left open for discussion for future cases, which I think this case is the prime or a very decent case to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.515" offset="11771543">Now, we're not asking this Court to interpret the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.810" offset="11800696">That has been clearly... clearly settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.322" offset="11810727">The diversity jurisdiction statute is what's involved; it's not Article III of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.159" offset="13446097">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.951" offset="13449231">There is a distinction in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.533" offset="13455605">Now, the term, the operation of the modern-day limited partnership, I think tracks very closely with the operation of corporations, particularly when you get into these master limited partners... partnerships that are created and sold on the public market where you've got thousands of shareholders where you don't really care who the other limited partners are, you just purchase... you invest in this business operation and you've got essentially a board of directors, i.e., the general partners, controlling the whole... the whole works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.170" offset="13562080">And I think that whatever rule you decide today has to be applicable to not only the partnership that we have in question, which is a 44-member limited partnership with only one Louisiana limited partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.766" offset="13612549">And but it would be applicable to these mass of master limited partnerships that could cause, you know, a pretty big stink in the securities industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.431" offset="13647135">You know, I'm not suggesting that the people invest in these master limited partnerships simply to use diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.285" offset="13670541">Not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.006" offset="13673466">But it would be unfair to preclude the master limited partnerships from diversity jurisdiction because in all likelihood you'll never be able to get diversity if you're a member of one of these master limited partners.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.758" offset="13736474">Well, if it's a question within the partnership itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.940" offset="13749222">But if it's a simple debt or creditor relationship where the partnership is a debtor, then the security problems really don't come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.983" offset="13777329">And I might say that diversity of jurisdiction is still here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.025" offset="13789555">Some people don't like it, but we still have it and we have to live with it and I dare say that in my practice in south Louisiana and in southern Texas I will always file in federal court with an out-of-state plaintiff and I will always remove with an out-of-state defendant in any of those state courts over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.988" offset="13857368">It may be awhile since any of you have tried something down there, but I can tell you that there is a reason for diversity jurisdiction still existing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.936" offset="13961127">The problem with the Fifth Circuit's decision is you can't tell who is in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.510" offset="13987458">Someone who appears of record as a limited partner may very well be the managing controller of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.225" offset="14022358">And someone from the outside looking in with nothing but the record to look at doesn't know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.810" offset="14048689">To... if we're going to consistently apply the Fifth Circuit's test, then we're going to have an enormous amount of in limine litigation and discovery to determine who among the limited partners, if any, have engaged in the management of the partnership.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3497.316" offset="14134684">I agree that control is pretty bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.125" offset="14141894">It's sort of hard to figure out who has how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.277" offset="14150567">But what about a test that says, look, what we're confronted with is an animal that is in between a partnership, a regular partnership in which there's unlimited liability on the part of all of the partners and a limited partnership of the sort that was involved in Great Southern in which there was no personal liability on... on behalf of any of the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.360" offset="14226844">Here you have one right in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.569" offset="14231755">You have some of the partners who have personal liability and others who don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.284" offset="14250564">So the choice is whether you treat it... you know, which way do you flop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.967" offset="14265297">And why can't you say so long as you have some partners who have unlimited personal liability you'll treat it as a partnership involving those partners?</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.731" offset="14296330">--Well, that's certainly an argument, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.322" offset="14314720">However, if simplicity of operation in the administration of justice is a test, following the current jurisprudence of the Court is a far simpler matter than trying to delve into these questions of who among the 44 limited partners may have involved himself in management, if he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.564" offset="14431644">I don't see how even under Mr. Hoffman's test you can ignore that.</text>
