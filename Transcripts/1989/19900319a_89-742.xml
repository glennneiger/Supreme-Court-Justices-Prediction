            <text syncTime="19.045" offset="205653">This is a statutory habeas corpus case brought by a Texas state prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.781" offset="224566">The question presented is whether the ex post facto clause was violated when the state appellate court applied a statute that allowed it to reform the judgment to delete an unauthorized punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.006" offset="277438">In 1981 Carroll Youngblood abducted and sexually assaulted a young woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="297082">He was tried the next year upon his plea of not guilty, and was found guilty of the offense of aggravated sexual assault by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.581" offset="327802">Thereafter, a separate punishment hearing was held before the same jury, in which the state proved that Youngblood had previously been convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.187" offset="362179">The jury assessed punishment of life imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.173" offset="382136">Following affirmance of his conviction, Youngblood filed a state habeas application in which he complained that the fine that the jury assessed was not authorized by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.512" offset="419439">The Texas court of criminal appeals agreed and granted relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.131" offset="433963">Acting pursuant to Article 37.10(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the court of criminal appeals reformed the judgment to delete the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.939" offset="473147">Youngblood remains incarcerated pursuant to the life sentence handed down by his jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.609" offset="1003851">I would suggest to the Court that in every case in which the Court has found a violation due to a procedural change, it has fit within the Calder framework with two exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.683" offset="1056200">The first of those is Thompson v. Utah, involving the right to a 12-person jury under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.189" offset="1090159">At the time of the offense, Utah was a territory and the defendant was entitled to the Federal right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.312" offset="1126626">At that time, in 1898, the Court was of the opinion that that right embraced the right to a 12-person jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.483" offset="1159331">By the time the case was tried Utah had become a state and had passed a statute limiting the jury to eight persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.673" offset="1192141">I think what animated the Court's decision in Thompson was the notion that the change in law had deprived the defendant of a right he possessed under the Federal Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.202" offset="1370192">The second case, I think, which does not fit perhaps neatly within the Calder framework would be Kring v. Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.039" offset="1401539">That was a case in which the defendant pleaded guilty to a less included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.693" offset="1424213">Missouri law provided that that plea of guilty represented an acquittal of the greater offense, which would have been a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.568" offset="1463710">I think... there are two things that can be said about Kring.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.020" offset="1485549">One, it is very doubtful that Kring remains good law in light of later decisions of this Court regarding the effect of a guilty plea and withdrawal of that plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.029" offset="1537584">But regardless of whether it does, in Kring the effect of the change in law was such that the defendant was subjected to a death sentence, which was not in effect at the time of the offense, not in effect if he had pled guilty to the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.991" offset="1613444">So in that sense Kring represents a change in law that deprived the defendant of an absolute defense to punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.597" offset="1643851">In this case that is not so.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.917" offset="1665062">The result he seeks is a reversal and the right to a new trial, in which he again could be sentenced to a term of life imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.994" offset="1833395">The Kring court characterized it as one in which the rules of evidence were altered so that the prior plea of guilty and acquittal of the greater had no force in the second trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.638" offset="8023998">That is going to be arguable, and of course, the state, making the best case scenario, would want to make you believe that somebody did not have that sort of right either, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.426" offset="8063181">But my point is that under the new law, simply all that happened is the state was given the same rights as the defendant, and that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.634" offset="8099962">And the defendant still wasn't being deprived of any of the rights that he had under the old law, and in this particular case we don't have that at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.330" offset="8278744">--What I think the Court has focussed on in its past decisions, though, is what rights were defined on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.150" offset="8306016">If you have an individual case that happens to work to an individual's harm, and it just happens to apply that way in this particular individual case, then that was just the unfortunate act that occurred in that individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.659" offset="8368082">But if the statute is neutral in its face, then it can be retrospectively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.599" offset="8395772">But if it is not neutral in its face, if it is on its face clearly detrimental, clearly more onerous, then it is ex post facto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.835" offset="8424820">And that is the distinction I would make in most of the cases where relief was granted or not granted, whether the statute on its face was more onerous or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.875" offset="8464944">I also want to talk about part of the government's... U.S. government's comment that Bogany is simply a windfall for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.266" offset="8510502">In actuality, if Article 37.10(b) is allowed to be applied retrospectively, the real windfall would be for the state, because the state would be allowed to enforce a judgment that was otherwise void according to the law in Bogany... or according to the court of criminal appeals decision in Bogany.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.894" offset="8581033">And so the state is trying to seek a windfall in this case in trying to find a way to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.715" offset="8604334">Again, as I indicated a little bit ago, the state has been doing everything that it could to undo the effects of Article 37.10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.488" offset="8639338">Judge Garza commented that he could be sympathetic with the state, but wanted to do something to avoid the retry of these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.195" offset="8678208">But he said it may be wise public policy, but wise public policy does not justify the use of ex post facto legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.432" offset="8711122">Justice Chase also discussed the same basic idea and said that the British used to justify its use of ex post facto legislation to say it was necessary for the safety of the kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.157" offset="8750097">Basically, we have the same sort of attitude being expressed both by Judge Garza and Justice Chase, that statutes were being made because it seemed reasonable for a public policy perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.363" offset="8794923">But again, as Judge Garza is indicating and as Justice Chase was indicating, if it violates the ex post facto clause, it is not admissible or allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.820" offset="8836719">Again, the framers of the Constitution did not buy the argument that you ought to be able to utilize ex post facto legislation for the benefit or for the necessity of the government or the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.644" offset="8884053">If it deprives an individual of the basic right, then it is ex post facto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.782" offset="8904533">Finally, there is one other point that seems very important to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.054" offset="8941627">If Article 37.10(b) is allowed to be applied retrospectively, it will seriously undermine the traditional role of the appellate courts in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.577" offset="8983736">It would stand for the proposition that anytime a legislature does not like the effects of an appellate decision, then they can come back and pass a new law, apply a label on it that it is procedural in nature and apply it retrospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.971" offset="9053327">And the effect of that sort of proposition would be that the basic notion in our form of government that a law ought to be applied... or a decision by appellate court ought to be applied consistently to everybody else in the same posture, would be eroded, because you have no idea from one case to the next... the members of the public wouldn't have any idea from one case to the next whether the law would be applied consistently to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.273" offset="9150502">And the facts of this case, again, after Bogany was decided, numerous individuals filed applications for writs of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.092" offset="9177774">Numerous inmates were having their cases reversed, and the court wanted to stop that, understandably so, maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.680" offset="9200135">But if they deprive an individual of a right that they had--</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.688" offset="9360213">I had, for example, a case at the time that was decided... Article 37.10(b) went into effect June 11, 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.894" offset="9389052">I had a case decided June 17, 1985, the exact same facts as here, and the case was reversed, just like the Bogany cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.750" offset="9424474">The state came back with a motion for rehearing and said Article 37.10(b) just went into effect, and we think you ought to have a rehearing on this case because it is simply a procedural change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.623" offset="9467942">And when, about a week after the Johnson case came out, my case was decided on rehearing and the exact same results came out as we have in the Johnson case or in the respondent's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.365" offset="9522904">And so your scenario that we basically have has in fact happened in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.686" offset="9540144">And again, in this particular case as well, pursuant to 11.07, the Code of Criminal Procedure, the rules for filing applications of writs of habeas corpus in Texas, the... Youngblood had filed his application for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.862" offset="9600853">It went to the trial court; the trial court recommended that relief be granted based upon the body of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.064" offset="9621647">And that was in about February 1985, and then the case sat at the court of criminal appeals for a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.337" offset="9646724">In the meantime, Spaulding was decided, and then the legislature came back immediately after Spaulding was decided to pass Article 37.10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.609" offset="9687893">And then, finally, my case was decided after the effective date of Article 37.10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.096" offset="9709836">Basically, the scenario that you have here is the legislature is trying to curtail all these individuals from being able to have the same rights as the court of criminal appeals defined in Bogany v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.285" offset="9750587">Again, the, one of the underlying reasons for the adoption of the ex post facto clause... the state focused on one, that is the concept of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.141" offset="9782038">The other is to prevent arbitrary and vindictive legislation on the part of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.360" offset="9798861">Here, if the, I believe that the government is engaging in vindictive and arbitrary legislation to cut off the possibility that anybody else could be able to obtain relief as defined by the court of criminal appeals in Bogany.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.602" offset="9847867">Clearly the basic underlying notion of the ex post facto clause is applicable in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.106" offset="9873885">If there is no further questions, I will close at this time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="2446.046" offset="9913591">Very briefly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.683" offset="9932190">Youngblood has relied to some extent on the language in Ex parte Spaulding to the effect that prior to the passage of the statute an unauthorized jury verdict was a nullity and voided in its inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.257" offset="9986420">That language must be examined in light of what the court of criminal appeals subsequently said in Ex parte Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.029" offset="10013588">Johnson, as you have just been told, was the first case to come before the court after the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.833" offset="10036784">Johnson got his judgment reformed to have the fine deleted, as did Youngblood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.821" offset="10060713">The court of criminal appeals discussed prior Texas law under which it had no reformation authority, and then went on to say, and I quote, in this sense a judgment and sentence were considered void since there was no way to cure the infirmity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.062" offset="10117660">Since these cases were decided, however, the legislature has enacted a new law that enlarges the authority of courts to reform judgments, thus providing a way to cure the infirmity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.102" offset="10161859">To the extent that such verdicts were void under Texas law, they were void for the reasons stated by the Johnson court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.392" offset="10194982">Indeed, Judge Campbell, who was the author of the Spaulding opinion, filed a concurring opinion in Johnson in which he explained that the only thing that was truly void was the unauthorized fine, and that once the statute was applied to delete that fine, the remainder of the verdict was valid and could be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.789" offset="10272618">The only other comment I would like to make is a lot of the argument today has focussed on whether or not Youngblood had a right and whether or not that was a substantial right, and whether he was harmed by the application of the statute to his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.715" offset="10332282">Well, I have tried to convince the Court that this is a case of whether or not the court's possessed authority regardless, not whether it was a right of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.904" offset="10373033">It seems to me that what is the more fundamental right involved here is that of a defendant to have an error-free trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.891" offset="10396961">That is exactly what Youngblood got.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.343" offset="10406783">He presented no evidence whatsoever in the guilt, innocence or punishment phases of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.497" offset="10427367">There is absolutely no suggestion that there was any error affecting either phase of that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.985" offset="10449415">The only error was this lagniappe, this fine tacked on to the term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.054" offset="10473656">That harm was removed when the Texas court reformed the judgment, and there was no harm existing after that, and no right to any other result.</text>
