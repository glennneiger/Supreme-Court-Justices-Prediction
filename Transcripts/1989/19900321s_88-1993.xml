            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87123">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Butterworth against Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.397" offset="112619">In this case, the respondent, Michael Smith, was a reporter who obtained information relevant to alleged improprieties committed by the State Attorney’s office in the Sheriff’s Department in the Charlotte County, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.248" offset="172073">It was then called before a special grand jury which had been convened to investigate the allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.299" offset="196315">At the time he testified, he was warned by Florida officials not to reveal his testimony in any manner since he could be found criminally liable for violating a Florida law which prohibits a grand jury witness from ever disclosing the content, gist, or import of testimony given before that body.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.200" offset="279907">After the investigation ended, Smith set out to publish a news story about the subject matter of the investigation and he sued the State of Florida seeking a declaration that the Florida law, which I have mentioned, violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.034" offset="355244">The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that this Florida law was unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibits a witness from speaking about his testimony after a grand jury investigation has terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.164" offset="411773">We granted certiorari to review this judgment and for reasons stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk, we agree with the Court of Appeals that Florida’s interest in prohibiting a grand jury witness from disclosing his own testimony after an investigation has ended are insufficient to overcome Smith’s First Amendment right to make a truthful statement of information he acquired outside the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.452" offset="508844">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.638" offset="521592">The decision of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.756" offset="530055">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
