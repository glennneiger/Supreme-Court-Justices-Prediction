            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136409">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-386, Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation v. Patrick Feeney.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="184579">Mr. Lesser.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_lesser" startTime="15.926" stopTime="211.603">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Lesser</label>
            <text syncTime="15.926" offset="200043">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.545" offset="214567">The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was created in 1921 by a compact between the states to which Congress consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.333" offset="253647">And the principal burden of my argument today before the Court is to demonstrate beyond any question whatsoever that the Port Authority is structured, administered and operated as a direct instrumentality of the compacting states, and is politically and legally accountable as such to the governors and legislatures of the compacting states.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.683" offset="343090">It should therefore, I submit, be recognized for what it clearly is: an integral part of the governmental machinery of the two states, completely subject to their control and direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.090" offset="392722">As a direct arm of the states, the Port Authority should be held, I believe, to share the states' constitutional protections and immunities, including their Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.314" offset="441624">Such a holding, I shall show, fulfills not only the underlying purpose of the Eleventh Amendment's conceded deference to state's sovereignty, but also that of the compact clause, by encouraging the states to solve cooperatively their regional problems, thus enhancing, I submit, the vitality of our Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.478" offset="522290">That the Port Authority is unquestionably a direct arm of the states, fully subject to their control and direction is most easily demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.019" offset="564399">The compact declares that the commissioners of the Port Authority, 12 in all, constitute the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.689" offset="595119">Six of these commissioners are appointed by the governor of each state, with the advice and consent of the respective state senates.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.962" offset="628242">The commissioners are subject to removal after charges upon hearing in New York by the governor of the state, and in New Jersey by the state senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.587" offset="670665">The governors significantly possess a veto power over all actions which the commissioners of the Authority take.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.507" offset="702430">The Authority cannot take any action which is not subject to gubernatorial veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.644" offset="722910">And the Authority, as an arm of the states, is completely subject to legislative control and direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.750" offset="755407">The Authority has no autonomous powers of government, like a county or a municipality, which of course, counties and municipalities do not share the states' sovereign immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.241" offset="805353">The Port Authority has no such powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.260" offset="817369">Everything the Port Authority does is authorized by bi-state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.680" offset="839103">And the Port Authority is duty bound to be obedient to the legislatures and to follow their directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.418" offset="866061">Because of the Port Authority's closeness, intimate relationship to the compacting states, it is not surprising that before 1950 and '51, when the states waived the Port Authority's sovereign immunity, every court that had occasion to pass upon this question, the courts of New York, the courts of New Jersey and the lower Federal courts held that the Port Authority shared the sovereign immunity from suit of the compacting states.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.420" offset="978074">As a matter of fact--</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="211.603" offset="982776">Mr. Lesser, suppose a municipal corporation had those characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.590" offset="1010675">Suppose state law provided that the chief executive officer of a municipality could be impeached by the legislature, and was appointed initially by the... by the governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.737" offset="1087266">Would that... would that make a... a municipal corporation an arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes?</text>

            <text syncTime="244.474" offset="1114225">I think this question before the Court is really fact intensive or fact specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.878" offset="1135854">A municipal corporation has autonomous powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.663" offset="1147034">As this Court said years ago, it's too remote from the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.031" offset="1164484">The Port Authority is not too remote from the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.733" offset="1175247">In fact, the only reason probably the Port Authority is not a department of state government was that the necessity of interstate cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.006" offset="1208370">It was the necessity to draft a compact between the states creating this agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.093" offset="1228745">In fact--</text>

            <text syncTime="304.613" offset="1354760">If the legislators... two legislatures disagree, I suppose the Authority does whatever it wants.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.535" offset="1390496">It can't do what it wants in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.570" offset="1402616">As a matter of fact, the only time the Port Authority was held to exceed its statutory powers was a case in the early 1950s when the Port Authority thought it had the power to construct a third tube to the Lincoln Tunnel, relying upon a statutory directive that said that the Lincoln Tunnel shall consist of tubes or tube... tube or tubes within a narrow geographical compass.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.471" offset="1502195">And the Port Authority thought that the plural meant two or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.541" offset="1522571">But the New Jersey Supreme Court held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.676" offset="1535109">And the New Jersey Supreme Court said that the Port Authority is bound... duty bound to be obedient to the legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.980" offset="1560291">And with that decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Port Authority subsequently got a specific bi-state legislation authorizing the construction of the third tube.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.020" offset="1600416">The Port Authority, Justice Scalia, could do nothing that the legislatures do not authorize.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.090" offset="1624762">Is completely subject to their control in the same way that almost any department of state government is subject to their control.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.596" offset="1654750">The states originally tried to act cooperatively when they entered into a compact in 1919, relating to the Holland Tunnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.285" offset="1689545">There were separate state commissions in New York and in New Jersey that were acting cooperatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.237" offset="1709294">And that just didn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.422" offset="1718071">It didn't work efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.891" offset="1723922">And therefore, the legislatures, under the compact clause, which as Felix Frankfurter and James M. Landis wrote from the path-breaking article in the Yale Law Journal in 1925, fosters Federalism by encouraging the states to solve cooperatively problems that transcend their state boundaries but yet do not need national solutions at the Federal level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.521" offset="5790456">There is a veto at the state level in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.258" offset="5813340">Then this Court said how is the agency designated in the enabling state legislation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.162" offset="5836954">And the Port Authority, in the enabling state legislation, is clearly designated as a joint or common agency of the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.101" offset="5868719">In fact, in the compact to which Congress consented be... there was no sue and be sued clause as I already mentioned... the legislatures, in their preamble, stated that the development of necessary terminal transportation and other facilities of commerce in the region require the cordial cooperation of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.365" offset="5949803">And this can be best accomplished, said the legislatures, through the cooperation of the two states by and through a joint or common agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.803" offset="5987524">That's... and there are many similar descriptions in the legislation of the Port Authority, as the common agency of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.207" offset="6021170">Then the next factor that this Court set forth in the Tahoe Regional Planning Association case was how was the agency funded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.146" offset="6052935">And as I previously mentioned, the Port Authority was funded by the state legislatures until it became self-sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.418" offset="6081983">And in the early days in its history, when... faced a default on its first bridge bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.203" offset="6105180">And the legislatures were faced with the problem of a default by an agency like the Port Authority, they turned over to the Port Authority their Holland Tunnel, which, as I mentioned before, was constructed by separate state commissions or state departments, operating cooperatively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.934" offset="6284066">In fact, the New Jersey Supreme Court recognized that there can be multiple state treasuries in a case involving the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.754" offset="6315413">In this particular case, the New Jersey Supreme Court was faced with the problem of whether the Authority should have the states' rights to require the uncompensated relocation of private/public utilities in the streets and the thoroughfares of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.001" offset="6392318">And the New Jersey Supreme Court said that that state rule was equally applicable to the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.303" offset="6413529">The Port Authority cannot be thus divorced from the citizens and taxpayers it was created to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.457" offset="6434218">And the New Jersey Supreme Court stated that the general state taxpayer has a tremendous interest in the financial solvency and the operations of the Port Authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.802" offset="6611537">I'd like to begin, if I may, by responding to a question that Justice Marshall posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.325" offset="6641630">In the legislation governing the World Trade Center, the language is quite specific that the Port Authority is supreme in its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.053" offset="6720520">All details of the effectuation, including but not limited to, financing, leasing, rentals, tolls, fares, shall be within its sole discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.094" offset="6756778">And its decision in connection with all matters, including the Hudson tubes, shall be controlling and conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.669" offset="6807038">The Port Authority has been described in the enabling legislation as a body corporate and politic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.906" offset="6835981">It has been described as a private corporation in the statute that authorizes suit against the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.828" offset="6867642">It says, as if it were a private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.982" offset="6888331">Now the Port Authority has broad powers, which it exercises as it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.152" offset="6916961">It does not go to either state to get second opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.504" offset="6930336">It does not go to either state to ask their approval for what it wants to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.675" offset="6955100">It owns real estate in its own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.627" offset="6966907">It leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.062" offset="6976625">It operates real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.764" offset="6987387">It operates marine terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.900" offset="6995955">It issues bonds in its own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.168" offset="7009016">It borrows money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.369" offset="7017793">It operates its own general reserve fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.405" offset="7030019">And the decisions have held... opinion of the attorney general that's cited in the brief... that the bonds of the Port Authority are not obligations of either the State of New York or New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.748" offset="7095325">It operates commuter railroads, bridges, tunnels, the World Trade Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.819" offset="7115596">It even has its own police department, and they're called Port Authority Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.223" offset="7137225">Now, the best way, I suppose, to find out what the Port Authority really is, is to see how they describe themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.161" offset="7181007">The Port Authority describes itself in its comprehensive annual financial report in 1987, which they issue every year: Unlike many other authorities and governmental agencies, the Port Authority, by law, must be self-supporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.325" offset="7257702">It has neither the power to tax nor the right to pledge the credit of either state to support its general obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.514" offset="7290407">The Port Authority pays its own way for operations on capital investment, pooling revenues earned from its facilities through rents, fees, fares, tolls and other user charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.156" offset="7337010">It finances new construction, major improvements and repairs by selling its bonds and other obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.011" offset="7376402">Now, there is specific... there is a specific section, 7031, which says that all bonds issued by the Port Authority are deemed to be negotiable instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.889" offset="7443903">And they are traded widely in brokerage houses and the stock exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.861" offset="11883779">If there's any doubt any... the mind of any Justice of this Court that the Port Authority is a direct arm and agency of the States of New York, I would really request that you look at appendix A to our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.656" offset="11946995">Because that appendix sets forth the 150-odd statutes... separate statutes that the states have passed in reference to the Port Authority from 1921 to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.398" offset="12001957">Those statutes, dealing with major considerations of state public policy to minor housekeeping chores, in my mind, demonstrates beyond question that the Port Authority is a direct agency and arm of the states that created them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.211" offset="12077189">This list of statutes, by subject matter and title, I think leaves no doubt in anybody's mind... should leave no doubt in anybody's mind... of the status of the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.852" offset="12123792">It has been... the Port Authority has been questioned as a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.071" offset="12140615">It is referred to in the compact as a joint or common agency of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.891" offset="12163916">The reason why the Port Authority was created and given those functions was that those problems transcend state boundary lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.230" offset="12197248">The states try to cooperate in the 1919 compact, to which Congress consented, by setting up independent commissions that were really departments of state government to act cooperatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.804" offset="12251583">It wasn't an efficient mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.490" offset="12262345">I think the compact clause, with the Eleventh Amendment, would fortify Federalism, would fortify the underlying principles of Federalism by giving the states the power to set up an entity like the Port Authority, which is undoubtedly a state agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3051.169" offset="12341026">That was... yes, it was, in contradiction to a normal municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.271" offset="12357431">In the same provision of the compact, it refers to ordinary municipal corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.842" offset="12379687">It was something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.159" offset="12385016">It was unknown at the time what the Port Authority was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.413" offset="12397973">It was a major advance, I think, in American public law on government that the states could use the compact clause creatively, to create an agency that would represent them in all affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.217" offset="12529212">I just haven't got the phrase right before me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.252" offset="12541333">But it distinguishes between ordinary municipality and municipal corporate instrumentality, which is the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.490" offset="12566306">The Port Authority is assuredly not a municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.192" offset="12577173">It has no power to tax; it has no general police power; it has no right to enact ordinances; it has no general condemnation power; it has no home law powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.297" offset="12617506">My opponent referred to the provision in the suability statute that the Port Authority should be liable as if it were a private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.569" offset="12646659">That provision was inserted to get around the New York Court of Appeals decision in State against Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.807" offset="12675602">Unless that provision applied, specifically waiving immunity from... creating immunity... creating tort liability, the Port Authority might not have been liable in tort, even though it was otherwise suable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.400" offset="12729937">The same language, practically, apply... is found in the New York Court of Claims Act, where the state waived its sovereign immunity for itself in the New York Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.772" offset="12771420">My opponent also referred to some language saying that the Port Authority, in operating its facilities, shall not... does not have to comply with rules and regulations of others.</text>
