            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="197926">During a lawful inventory search of a locked... a locked suitcase was opened for inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.080" offset="221123">The Florida Supreme Court suppressed the evidence found therein, finding that the Fourth Amendment requires that the scope of an inventory to be explicitly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.352" offset="258217">Florida asked this Court to hold than an inventory search encompasses the entire contents of the vehicle, including closed containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.208" offset="293639">Such a rule of law will be incontinent with the purposes of Opperman and, as we affirm, in Bertine.</text>

            <text syncTime="62.906" offset="388515">The scope of an inventory in and of itself states that you are to catalogue the doc, the documents and the property found within the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.964" offset="440760">It is solely to areas where valuable personal property would attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.320" offset="474093">In the case before the Court, the Florida Supreme Court found that there was a good faith impoundment, and that the inventory of the interior of the car, as well as the inventory of the trunk, was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.199" offset="541697">What the Florida Supreme Court found then, that the opening of the... the prying open of the locked suitcase to inventory that, was unlawful and violative of the principles announced in Bertine, because it held that Bertine required standardized procedures listing the exact nature and scope of an inventory search.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.081" offset="641172">The state position in front of this Court is that Bertine does not require such a detailed listing, just that there be procedures, whether written or oral, that all inventory... all impounded cars are inventoried.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.609" offset="711284">By requiring that all impounded cars are inventoried, this will take away the evidentiary discretion that this Court has so declared unconstitutional in its previous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.285" offset="766037">The evidentiary discretion would be taken away because every car would then be subject to inventory.</text>

            <label>Mr. Huntley Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="1691.722" offset="6903768">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.459" offset="6922680">The issue here is much more basic than the State of Florida would have us believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.530" offset="6942951">The question is, is was this an inventory procedure at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.982" offset="6960819">And the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.565" offset="6967088">And the answer is no is because there was no inventory form, and a close study of the record will show that indeed Trooper Adams did not have any idea what was in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.473" offset="7014736">And I would like to refer to two places in the joint appendix to prove that up, if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.675" offset="7031559">At page 217 of the joint appendix, the trial counsel is questioning Trooper Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.864" offset="7064264">Question: All right, did you look in the trunk first?</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.364" offset="7074295">Now, this is his full answer: We opened the trunk and that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.433" offset="7090595">What was in the trunk?</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.200" offset="7097701">Oil cans and a suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.485" offset="7106791">That is the trooper trying to recall what was in the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.187" offset="7121629">Question: What?</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.539" offset="7126958">Answer: A couple of oil cans, an oil can, a can of oil, or something like that, and a suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.027" offset="7156946">That is at the motion to suppress before the trial judge in this case, and my opponent would have you believe that the trial judge did not address the issue of the inventory in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.601" offset="7199265">Please look at page 221, in which the argument is before the trial court, and the court says well, it really would appear to me that the thrust of the defense argument here is as contained in the motions, as contained in his memorandum, statement of facts, and is indicated by the line of questioning that he made of the witness, is that the trooper's main interest was not inventorying, but searching for contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.318" offset="7306158">Clearly it was addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.937" offset="7312636">The first document in the joint appendix is the motion to suppress in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.572" offset="7331131">It has got 70-something paragraphs in it, and the thrust of it, it goes to several things, but the inventory search is certainly one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.928" offset="7364568">Question as to whether this was an inventory or a search, on page 49 of the joint appendix, this is the sworn deposition of Trooper Adams, which was admitted by the trial judge as part of the record because of the fact that he did not want us to go over, did not want trial counsel to go over items that had already been covered in the sworn depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.741" offset="7443771">Question by trial counsel: Did you see any empty beer cans or beer bottles in the car?</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.312" offset="7470102">Answer: I can't recall any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.681" offset="7479611">Well, you at some point did inventory the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.633" offset="7491418">Answer: I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.033" offset="7496956">And if you had--</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.335" offset="7502181">But that has been awhile since I did that, and if there was a beer can in there I can't remember if there was or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.405" offset="7526422">Okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.986" offset="7724848">Yes, I do, and I would like to expand on that, if I could, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.206" offset="7741671">The chief counsel for the Florida Highway Patrol filed an amicus curiae in 1987 in which, this is after the Fifth DCA, the lower appellate court in Florida had ruled three to nothing in favor of the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.085" offset="7809172">The amicus curiae was filed, in which they relied on Chapter 16 of the Florida Highway Patrol Manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.572" offset="7839160">Chapter 16 of the Florida Highway Patrol Manual was not in effect at all on February 11, 1985, when Trooper Adams went into the car of Mr. Wells, went into the trunk and into the suitcase, the locked suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.331" offset="7902168">The locked suitcase, which should have had a higher expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.402" offset="7914497">It wasn't in effect, and unfortunately the supreme court was misled because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.537" offset="7934977">No one picked it up along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.389" offset="7946367">None of the appellate lawyers, none of the clerks, none of the court, in the supreme court, but that issue never came up until it was interjected by the counsel for the troopers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.047" offset="7993074">It was not in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.316" offset="7998089">So what we have to look at, under Bertine and after... under the decision of Florida, and the cases before Bertine, is was there any standard caretaking procedure that guided this trooper in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.557" offset="8051066">The testimony goes to that point on page 82 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.693" offset="8075621">Question: Have you ever applied for a search warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.097" offset="8097250">Answer: No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.047" offset="8101012">Can you think of a set of circumstances under which you might apply for a search warrant when it involves a vehicle?</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.418" offset="8122537">Well, at this time I thought that would be appropriate, a search warrant would be appropriate, but based on what we had here, and it was part of the search, I figured it was part of the search, and I didn't see where it need be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.861" offset="8180320">On page 83, Question: When did it first occur to you that maybe a search warrant would be appropriate?</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.099" offset="8205293">Answer: While I was doing the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.033" offset="8216995">But like I said, I felt like opening the suitcase would come under the inventory search of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.037" offset="8241028">This trooper had no guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.889" offset="8256388">Question below that on page 83.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.293" offset="8270076">Even though it was locked and you had to use knives to pry it open?</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.078" offset="8285123">Answer: Well, I had to take my chances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.947" offset="8300692">And the reason, Your Honors, that he had to take his chances, is because he had no procedures to guide him whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2506.026" offset="10160924">Answer: Officer Adams said he wanted to inventory the car good.</text>
