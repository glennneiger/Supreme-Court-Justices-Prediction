            <text syncTime="11.988" offset="181766">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.321" offset="195141">In this case we ask the Court to decide whether the state may prohibit jury sympathy in capital sentencing or, conversely, whether the Eighth Amendment requires defendants be permitted an appeal to the sympathy of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.049" offset="246028">Because we believe that a sympathy plea is not constitutionally required, we ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.865" offset="281345">The respondent was convicted in the shooting murder of a gas station attendant in Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.698" offset="300676">During the sentencing phase of the trial, the court told the jury that it must consider eight minimum mitigating circumstances, and, in addition, that the jury should consider any other or additional mitigating circumstances, if any, that they may find from the evidence to exist in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.849" offset="373296">Thus, consistent with Oklahoma law, this instruction to the jury left the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence wide open, based upon the testimony at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.247" offset="418854">The prosecutor discussed in his closing each of the eight minimum mitigating circumstances in turn and told the jury that they had to consider them.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.533" offset="455948">In addition, the prosecutor told the jury that they could consider anything else they found in the record that might outweigh the aggravating circumstances in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.894" offset="629401">But under Teague, before adopting the rule that the respondent asserts, I think you need to determine, yes, whether as a new rule and whether it is dictated by--</text>

            <text syncTime="136.362" offset="679347">I know it isn't discussed in the briefs, and obviously Teague came out only last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.748" offset="700872">But since it's something that we may have to look at, I'd be interested in knowing your views.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.149" offset="722501">--Your Honor, if you feel that you need to look at it, I think Teague would compel the conclusion that the rule advanced by the court of appeals is a new rule because that rule was not dictated by precedent in force at the time Mr. Parks' conviction became final.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.996" offset="805884">Your Honor, I'm unaware of any authority from this court that existed when his... Mr. Parks' conviction became final which would have prohibited, or which would have required, a sympathy plea that would have barred the state... put on the state essentially the duty of permitting a sympathy plea.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="186.629" offset="880385">Well, I suppose the argument on the other side is that Locket and Eddings were already on the books and they require that you... that the jury be permitted to consider and give weight to evidence in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.159" offset="942452">Now, does the anti-sympathy instruction negate that, do you suppose?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Nance</label>
            <text syncTime="206.773" offset="960947">I don't think the anti-sympathy instruction negates the consideration of mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.258" offset="986860">Clearly the rule was that the jury had to consider the mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.672" offset="1004519">I don't think until the California versus Brown there was any hint from this Court that sympathy had to be a part of that consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.108" offset="1046315">And, of course, I don't think California versus Brown compels the conclusion that sympathy is required anyway.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="233.363" offset="1067317">California against Brown surely said that an instruction talking about mere sympathy was perfectly permissible, didn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Nance</label>
            <text syncTime="241.818" offset="1101172">That's entirely correct, and if the Court were to reach a rule in this case that sympathy... a sympathy plea was required, as the court of appeals felt it was, I think that would be a new rule, because it wouldn't be dictated by any precedent that existed when Mr. Parks' conviction--</text>

            <text syncTime="259.920" offset="1173583">Well, Mr. Nance, is it fair to say that the court of appeals said the sympathy instruction is required, or did they merely say that an anti-sympathy instruction is prohibited?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_nance" startTime="269.057" stopTime="273.781">

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="273.781" offset="1228963">And if it was prohibited, the reason for prohibiting it is that they interpreted, whether rightly or wrongly, Locket as saying an instruction which interferes with the jury's consideration of all mitigating circumstances is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.831" offset="1281208">So, if they're right, it's because they correctly interpreted Lockett.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.195" offset="2430596">Right or wrong, I don't see that this was dictated by Lockett, the court of appeals rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.899" offset="2453479">The jury in this case... what the court of appeals found unconstitutional about this instruction was that portion, of course, that said that you shall not let any influence of sympathy, sentiment, passion or prejudice enter into your deliberation or any other arbitrary factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.153" offset="2530488">That instruction went on to say that you should discharge your duties impartially, conscientiously and faithfully under your oaths and return such a verdict as is warranted by the evidence when measured by these instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.991" offset="2577822">We think that unlike the cases in which this Court has struck down death penalties based upon questions of mitigating evidence, this instruction, either from the court or from the prosecutor, did not construct any artificial barrier to the fact of the consideration of mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.133" offset="2650442">The respondent was completely free to introduce any mitigating evidence he chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.877" offset="2673326">The jury heard that evidence, and was told to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.251" offset="2690880">We don't think that this instruction can fairly be considered as one which would trick the jury into not considering the mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.387" offset="2727451">As I say, by its terms the instruction did not affect the fact of consideration or weighing or reporting to the court, as was the case in Mills or in Penry, but merely dealt with the manner in which the evidence should be weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.066" offset="2786174">We think a reasonable juror in this case would have no difficulty in interpreting the language challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.102" offset="2814282">They would understand it clearly and that understanding would be this: the jury had a duty to consider the evidence both aggravating and mitigating conscientiously, impartially and faithfully, and not with sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary emotional state.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.093" offset="2882201">We think this instruction resulted in a sober and conscientious exercise of the duty to weigh the evidence and to reach a sentence, and that the instruction told the jury how to consider that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.830" offset="2929221">We think the instruction told the jury how to consider the evidence in a way which is entirely consistent with this Court's law on rational and reliable capital sentencing based upon objective factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.700" offset="2980630">If we must go beyond the specific language challenged, we believe that Instruction No. 6 on the eight minimum mitigating circumstances and the wide open catchall provision of that instruction adequately informed the jury of its obligation to consider mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.921" offset="3049593">Thus, we believe the constitutional prerequisite which is consideration of the evidence rather than sympathy was met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.395" offset="3083448">The court has said, and I think said correctly, that capital sentencing should be a reasoned, moral response to the crime and to the criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.663" offset="3116467">In reaching that reasoned, moral response, the sentencing jury should hear whatever element the defendant might advance from his character or his record or the circumstances of the offense which might reduce his moral culpability or his guilt, which should be the focus in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.748" offset="3200894">This produces a sentencing procedure which is sensible to the uniqueness of the individual and permits the jury to know whatever the defendant wants to offer about himself or his background or the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.164" offset="3254498">This sort of sentencing procedure which is, I think, advanced by this instruction, helps eliminate the caprice or emotion which the court has struck down on one extreme, or helps avoid a mechanistic or unreasoning automatic death sentence which the court has struck down on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.919" offset="3333492">The respondent could and did submit mitigating evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.032" offset="3353972">His father testified that he was a happy-go-lucky sort of fellow, that he had had a troubled home life growing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.196" offset="3378632">The jury heard that without impediment from either the court or the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.078" offset="3398171">There is nothing in this record that we think leads us to believe fairly that the jury failed to consider that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.811" offset="3421054">Nothing detracted from the consideration of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.294" offset="3435056">We merely submitted to that jury an instruction which diverted their consideration away from extraneous emotional factors and toward the evidence which had been submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.433" offset="3483539">We think that emotional response to the evidence, which is what we understand sympathy to be, in no way contributes to the reasoned moral response that capital sentencing should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.199" offset="3526694">We think that sympathy, as the court said in Brown, is among a catalog of things which could improperly influence the sentence, and we need not have permitted the jury to consider it... or, to employ it in its consideration of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.860" offset="3597329">The court has said, and again I believe correctly, that sentencing should not be based on emotional factors which are wholly unrelated to the blameworthiness of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.379" offset="3639334">We want the jury to soberly consider that blameworthiness, the factors in aggravation and in mitigation, and come to a reasoned sentencing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.974" offset="3673711">We think this instruction is proper in a case... in a system of sentencing in which the punishment is directly related to the moral culpability or guilt of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.440" offset="3715611">We think it helped advance the reasoned moral response to the crime to the criminal, which should be the hallmark of capital sentencing, rather than an emotional response to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.358" offset="3767334">We think this case presents something of a fork in the road for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.291" offset="3786978">The road, of course, leads to consideration of mitigating evidence and the sort of objective sentencing which this Court has sought in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.418" offset="3823549">One fork in the road would invalidate death penalties which are otherwise complete and acceptable in their consideration of mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.054" offset="3858031">If the jury was not permitted to hear the sympathy plea, that fork in the road increases the discretion of appellate courts to set aside death penalties if they find, as this court of appeals found, that the sentencing jury did not fully consider the evidence with the proper emotional or mental framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.167" offset="3934517">The second fork in the road, and we think the sounder course, would leave intact death penalties in which the jury was properly instructed and did in fact consider the mitigating evidence and, in which the state, as here, guided that consideration in a way that makes the sentencing decision more rational and reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.080" offset="4014139">Again, this instruction told the jury how to consider the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.352" offset="4027304">The duty to consider mitigating evidence in this case was clear and unequivocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.426" offset="4043605">We think that only if the sympathy ploy is constitutionally required could this jury sentence be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.971" offset="4073698">We think the irony of all of this is that the court of appeals abandoned the protection for capital defendants which has been built into capital sentencing in the form of rational and reliable sentencing based upon objective factors which are plain in the record and open to sensible appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.144" offset="4154468">Instead of taking that approach, the court of appeals said that the jury should be able to hear the evidence in the natural and significant way, which was sympathetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.561" offset="4204101">We think that, as the court said in Brown, sympathy is far more likely to cut against the defendant than for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.977" offset="4233776">We also think that in a sense, capital sentencing is not a natural proceeding for a lay jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.631" offset="4264392">It's not something that they should do spontaneously and without direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.655" offset="4280483">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.704" offset="4288633">It's something unnatural in that this Court has said that their discretion should be guided and directed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.472" offset="4319771">And we think properly so in this case.</text>

            <label>Ms. Vivian Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="1179.353" offset="4851311">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.130" offset="4898331">The issue before you today, I believe, is a fairly narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.163" offset="4918498">Whether reasonable jurors could have understood sympathy, as referred to in the anti-sympathy instruction in this case, and in related comments by the prosecutor, to be a proxy for respondent's mitigating evidence concerning his background and could thereby have believed, unlike the jurors in California versus Brown, that they could not give effect in their verdict to Mr. Parks' mitigating case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.812" offset="5021107">Now, as the court of appeals majority clearly recognized... and this I believe also was the tendency of Justice Stevens' remarks... Mr. Parks asserts no constitutional right to a sympathetic or emotional jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.911" offset="5085472">What he does assert under Woodson, Lockett, Eddings and their progeny is the entirely familiar claim upheld consistently by this Court of a right to a sentencer who has not been precluded from considering as a mitigating factor any aspect of a defendant's background, character or record in addition to the circumstances of his offense that he proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.282" offset="5206994">It is for that reason as well that we are not contending for a new rule in the sense of Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.536" offset="5240013">Mr. Parks' cutoff date, if you will, in certiorari was denied from his direct appeal; the judgment in the court of criminal appeals was January 17th, 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.394" offset="6827422">To draw on Mr. Justice Harlan's comments over the years, certainly he alluded, as I believe you are alluding, to the deterrence or incentive function of habeas corpus, if you will, bringing state judges into line to act constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.831" offset="6889175">But Justice Harlan also alluded to the broader purpose of essentially enhancing the accuracy of procedures and in this case, of course one mainly talks about convictions in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.120" offset="6946331">But the rule that we are contending, which once again we believe is firmly grounded in Woodson and Lockett, those early decisions, tends to enhance the accuracy of sentencing in terms of the reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.930" offset="7001606">Because if there is one thing that this Court has said over-and-over and over-and-over in various contexts is that the sentencer may not be precluded from considering mitigating evidence, from considering it as Justice O'Connor said in Penry and as others have said at other times, fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.923" offset="7077570">And, of course, the whole point of this is that after considering evidence fully... not just hearing it... but having no barriers to its full consideration... then the jury may arrive at a reasoned moral response.</text>

            <text syncTime="1974.709" offset="8032712">I don't know if that means anything different, but I am certainly willing to rest on the notion of what a reasonable juror could have understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.034" offset="8057998">Also look at other differences from California versus Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.626" offset="8072313">Another thing that the court relied on heavily in Brown was the surrounding circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.122" offset="8094361">Mr. Brown had put in 13 witnesses in mitigation... three days of mitigating testimony... and the court understandably said... this Court... this isn't the kind of thing that a jury would probably think it ought to ignore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.893" offset="8149427">Whereas, the evidence in this case, while clearly classical evidence of mitigation going to respondent's disadvantaged background, was definitely sparse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.799" offset="8193103">It was contained in fact in five pages of direct testimony by Mr. Parks' father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.032" offset="8217972">To use Justice Brennan's words, a jury might well have thought that this was simply an instance where the defendant went too far in hearing the injunction that they were supposed to avoid sympathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.821" offset="8269172">It has always been interesting to me in this case that the state has relied on the prosecutor's comments in the case to fix matters while I think it's imminently clear that what the prosecutor's comments did was to make matters much worse, because he very clearly not only delivered his own anti-sympathy charge a couple of times, but made it very clear that background evidence was just a pitch for sympathy and you promised me in voir dire you wouldn't do that, said the prosecutor in his closing penalty summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.655" offset="8408457">Equally, the fact that the prosecutor did kind of a routine cook's tour through the so-called minimum mitigating circumstances didn't help in any way because all of those minimum mitigating circumstances in Oklahoma but one, go only to the circumstances of the offense or the defendant's condition at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.399" offset="8491422">Equally, other mitigation such as Mr. McKinney, the prosecutor, dealt with extremely briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.194" offset="8522664">Mr. McKinney in no way mentioned any of this troubled background evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.688" offset="8548578">Mr. McKinney simply mentioned what Mr. Nance mentioned about the happy-go-lucky nature of the respondent in this case, as his father called it, and also commented on respondent's criminal conviction and other bad acts in his past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.272" offset="8626945">There was nothing in this case that would lead this jury, really, to believe anything other than sympathy type evidence was something you couldn't consider and--</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.407" offset="8715448">And, in fact, turning to those instructions, the instructions to which you're referring, Chief Justice Rehnquist, are contained both in No. 9 which also contains the anti-sympathy instruction, and No. 6, which are set forth generally in the Joint Appendix at pages 10 to 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.463" offset="8795696">I am now looking at page 13 and just picking out one myself in addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.077" offset="8822132">At the bottom of the first paragraph there, after talking about the fact that these are all the instructions in the case, they give you the law, and then the court says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.685" offset="8860584">"You must consider them all together and not a part of them to the exclusion of the rest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.698" offset="8884617">In other words, of course there is this boilerplate language about look at the facts, look at the evidence, and listen to the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.864" offset="8913352">But notably also, listen to the anti-sympathy instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.769" offset="8932891">And even in that instruction itself, which is the next paragraph down on page 13, like most instructions, it's a mixture of language, as Mr. Nance pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.266" offset="8978971">After the anti-sympathy part, yes, the court says discharge your duties impartially, look at the evidence, return such verdict as the evidence warrants when measured by these instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.144" offset="9026410">Well, the cat's turning on its tail again because these instructions include not only the anti-sympathy instruction given immediately before, but also, by virtue of an earlier pickup charge, include any and all of the guilt phase instructions that the jurors may happen to think applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.247" offset="9102896">The jurors were not further guided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.849" offset="9109270">And in the guilt phase as well, there was an anti-sympathy instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.532" offset="9127974">So it seems to me one can say really two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.526" offset="9147931">In order to say that the rest of the instructions cured any problem with the anti-sympathy instruction, you would either have to say essentially that the general controls the specific, which would be the opposite of the usual approach, or would have to rest frankly with conflicting instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.457" offset="9223686">That, too, as this Court has often stated, is impermissible when one of the instructions in context could be read in a constitutionally impermissible manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2289.332" offset="9291187">And I think really what this case is about is whether it is reasonable to interpret an instruction which says in one place you may take into account all mitigating circumstances, and in another place that you will not be swayed by sympathy... whether it's reasonable to interpret the sympathy portion as contradicting what is said in the other portion... or, rather, whether a reasonable juror would say, well, mitigating circumstances are one thing and sympathy is something quite different from specific factors that justify being merciful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.666" offset="10020526">I think the problem is that sympathy may be the way in which people, at least some people, some jurors, some reasonable jurors, process the kind of mitigating evidence that we're talking about here, evidence of the defendant's disadvantaged background, process that through their minds in order to arrive at a moral response which can be both reasoned and reasonably sympathetic at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.238" offset="10146854">I think we have to look at this through the eyes of lay jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.006" offset="10517897">I think a juror confronted with evidence, including this rather sparse mitigating evidence concerning the defendant's background and saying, well, that's in the case too, how do I react to it, and then remembering well, it's there, but I was told I couldn't feel any sympathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.350" offset="10595219">And then I think the juror just sort of stops and scratches his or her head in some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.224" offset="10618730">That's the problem, because this instruction interferes with the full consideration of mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.529" offset="10644016">It is possible, Justice Scalia, that a juror could look at this evidence and somehow approach it extremely rationally and ask himself or herself, well, does this or does it not in some very reasoned way reduce culpability or not and in that sense could consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.782" offset="10716950">On the other hand, it is also extremely plausible that many people, many reasonable people, respond to this sort of evidence with sympathy and that is the way in which they in a sense say there is less culpability here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.604" offset="10784241">There is not less culpability because the juror feels sympathy, that's not the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.549" offset="10804094">But rather that simply, particularly lay people, tending to respond with sympathy, do so because that is their way of giving weight to the mitigating evidence in the culpability scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.616" offset="10856339">Yes, here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.739" offset="10868774">While preparing I came across what I think is a good statement in an en banc court of appeals decision in a different context from the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.135" offset="10906390">In Brooks versus Kemp, the en banc court was considering whether certain prosecutorial argument in the penalty phase was constitutionally impermissible because it appealed too much to emotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.115" offset="10966367">The court rejected that claim and said, I think, some things that are also applicable in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.961" offset="10989668">Said that reason alone cannot adequately explain a jury's decision to grant mercy to a person convicted of a serious murder because of that person's youth or troubling personal problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.178" offset="11038570">Nor can reason alone explain fully the reaction of a juror upon hearing the facts of a particular crime described in their tragically specific detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.853" offset="11073260">Empathy for a defendant's individual circumstance or revulsion at the moral affront of his crime, reactions accepted as basis for capital sentencing decisions, are not susceptible to full explanation without recourse to human emotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.184" offset="11138566">Then the court concludes, in the context of that case, the propriety of argument rests primarily in the relation of its content to issues relevant to the sentencing jury's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.393" offset="11187468">I would rephrase it to our context as follows: the propriety of sympathy rests primarily in the relation of it to mitigating evidence relevant to the sentencing jury's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.462" offset="11243683">So, sympathy is not sentiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.967" offset="11261760">Sympathy is not passion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.077" offset="11270119">Sympathy is not prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.579" offset="11288196">It is simply a way in which many people, many reasonable people, will respond to the sort of mitigating evidence at issue here if indeed they are inclined to respond to at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.488" offset="11335843">I think the problem, Justice Scalia, is that at least some jurors would have been impeded in reacting to mitigating evidence if they were to follow, as we must assume they followed, this instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.497" offset="11579827">--The moral worthiness, Your Honor, is the ultimate question, and if one were having a dialogue such as we were having now with a juror, perhaps one could make these points very expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.627" offset="11632385">But I do believe, in light of human nature and psychology and the fact that lay jurors are not experienced in sentencing, they may simply tend to express a view that someone deserves a bit less than death, deserves life imprisonment through the medium of... perhaps even empathy is a better word than sympathy which is not equivalent to some kind of wild irrationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.922" offset="11725590">I would simply want to end by placing the case in what I think is a very important context: the fact that this was essentially a marginal case for death.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.609" offset="11880339">This was not a case where the prime problem, as I see it, was likely tremendous passion on the side of the victim other than, of course, the natural sympathy which flows to the victim of a murder.</text>
