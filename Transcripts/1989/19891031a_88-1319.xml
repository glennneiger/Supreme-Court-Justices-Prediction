            <text syncTime="24.586" offset="232423">In this case the tax court, in a reviewed decision, and the court of appeals for the Seventh Circuit, rejected the position of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue previously upheld by the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, that customer deposits required by a public utility to ensure payment of future bills are income to the utility upon receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.119" offset="358542">The case involves only the tax treatment of the deposit itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.321" offset="723316">The position depends on the fact that the monies come into the dominion and control of the utility company, and are not segregated from the other assets of the company, and are subject to its unfettered use.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.271" offset="835120">And I don't think whether it is escrowed or not has very much different... very much to do at all with the economic reality of the matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="182.927" offset="865736">Well, under our tax system, and in particular for an accrual basis taxpayer, it has to have a right to the use of the monies within its own dominion and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.126" offset="930519">The cases do establish that as a criterion for taxability.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.239" offset="1110973">All that is at issue is whether when you get it it is income.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.773" offset="1121109">And it seems to me it makes no difference, when you are dealing with a massive public utility that has many assets, whether it goes into its own general pot or is put in escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.940" offset="1161755">In either case, it seems to me, the company gets assured the payment of the bill that is going to be later presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.458" offset="1199894">The economic reality between those two situations does not seem to me distinguishable.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.046" offset="1250258">The Commissioner's position is based on the receipt of funds within the dominion and control of the utility company.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.393" offset="1331656">It was reviewed because the previous decision of the tax court in the City Gas case had been reversed unanimously by the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.601" offset="1380452">So, all three lower court decisions that have addressed this have been unanimous, and somebody had to have been wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.912" offset="1441683">One of the tax years here is 15 years ago, 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.266" offset="1467074">Well, these things do tend to get sorted out many years after the taxable years at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.504" offset="1512109">The litigation, once it was under way, after the audit was made, moved forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.980" offset="1541994">The parties stipulated both the facts and the calculation of the tax consequences that would ensue for the years at issue should be Commissioner's position prevail.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="366.883" offset="1601553">Well, it gets so that the interest sometimes exceeds the basic tax, and this certainly isn't justice, normally.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="374.900" stopTime="658.931">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="374.900" offset="1633631">--Well, in any event the issue is now before this Court for resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.636" offset="1672606">And under the Commissioner's legal view, there are only two factual determinations in these stipulated facts recited by the tax court that are critical here, and indeed are dispositive under his legal view.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.691" offset="1768841">And in light of those two determinations, the remaining details of the way this program was administered become immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.030" offset="1810114">One is the one to which we have already adverted, that, and this is set forth on page 23a of our Appendix to the Petition in the tax court's opinion, that the deposits were not segregated from the Petitioner's general funds, the utility's general funds, and were subject to its unfettered use and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.326" offset="1907394">And the other critical determination, set forth on page 20a of the same Appendix, is that the intended purpose of the deposits was to ensure payment of future utility bills by the customers required to make the deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.373" offset="2011571">The Commissioner's position originated in a 1972 revenue ruling which we cite that considered the implications for utility deposits of a series of three decisions rendered by this Court and of related lower court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.813" offset="2125256">Those decisions, and this Court's previous decisions in the area, are unchallenged by the Respondent here, and of course unchallenged in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.293" offset="2183247">Those decisions established that advanced payments for goods and services to be provided in the future, that an advance payment is taxable income in the year of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.395" offset="2255659">And the difficult question which was decided in this series of cases is the one suggested by Justice O'Connor's question at the outset, whether that should be true for accrual basis taxpayers, whether to that extent the Commissioner had authority to set aside the accrual basis taxpayers' accounting method and insist on conformity in this respect for the advance payments received on an annual accounting method.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.441" offset="2411767">And that was the decision made in various factual situations in the Auto Club of Michigan case, the American Automobile Association case, and finally in Schlude against the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.724" offset="2484909">And, as the court put it in the American Automobile Association case, the deferral of the advance payment for accounting purposes, and I am quoting now, doubtless presents a rather accurate image of the total financial structure is sound for financial accounting purposes, but fails to respect the criteria of annual tax accounting, and may be rejected by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.498" offset="2628060">And in those decisions the court relied on Section 446(b) of the current code and its predecessor, Section 41 of the 1931 code, which gives the Commissioner authority when he determines that the taxpayer's accounting method does not accurately reflect income to require, in his discretion, that the taxpayer use a method that does accurately reflect income.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.191" offset="2822829">If you have a 12-month cycle and you get an advance payment for the 12 months, then the utility, over the period of 12 months, recognizes 12 months of income, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="685.320" offset="2875283">It doesn't recognize income in December, it recognizes two months of income in January.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.139" offset="8842591">Under the all events test of the accrual method you would only recognize income as the utility services are provided, as the customer is billed, and at that point income would be recorded on the books, even though payment, cash payment, had not actually been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.639" offset="8904554">Those cases held that, at least in certain circumstances, it is appropriate to tax a party upon the receipt of prepayments for those goods and services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.947" offset="9277791">The Commissioner's approach produces a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and it relates to this question of proper tax treatment of an accrual method taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.318" offset="9347277">As we just noted, an accrual method taxpayer reports income as the goods and services are delivered and billed for, and at that point income is put on the books for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.976" offset="9401925">In the taxpayers case, in this utility's case, income was recognized as the utility meter was read and as the customer was billed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.064" offset="9442258">So as soon as the income was recognized an account receivable was then put on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.047" offset="9462216">The advance payment rule says that depending on the facts, a prepayment of cash can be taxed at the time it is received, even though, under the normal accrual method, recognition of income would be deferred until the goods are actually delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.046" offset="9522193">This was the holding of the three trilogy, so-called trilogy cases, of the late '50s and early '60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.261" offset="9547061">But what the Commissioner is doing here is taking what was an exception to the all events test, the prepayment rule, and basically applying that in tandem with the accrual method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.399" offset="9595649">The result is a distortion of income, or a double counting of income, essentially along the lines that Justice Kennedy alluded to in Mr. Wallace's presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.028" offset="9646118">He is basically applying a cash method to the deposit, and an accrual method to the goods and services, simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.745" offset="9684988">It is being imposed simultaneously on the same series of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.217" offset="9702960">Because what happens is the deposit is included in income when collected, and the utility, under its normal accrual method of accounting, is also required to report income as it delivers services to its customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.007" offset="11314088">And the treatment of a cash basis deposit payor, or deposit payee, has relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.392" offset="11351600">The real question is, in that Revenue Ruling, is this particular sum a deposit or is it an advance payment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.387" offset="11383574">And the ruling states that whether a particular expenditure is a deposit or a payment depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, which is exactly what the tax court and the Seventh Circuit said here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.976" offset="11433938">And the ruling goes on to say that when it can be shown that the expenditure is not refundable, and is made pursuant to an enforceable sales contract, then in that case it will not be considered a deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.805" offset="11481272">So those are the very points that we think are important in trying to evaluate the taxability of the person that receives the deposit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.105" offset="11606451">I think the Commissioner would allow a consideration of the overall set of circumstances to try to arrive at that decision, but clearly, the refundability becomes a key point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.424" offset="11655770">We think that really it shouldn't make any difference which side of the coin you are looking at, as long as the issue is does the deposit serve as a true security deposit or does it serve as a... an advance payment for goods and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.944" offset="11717837">The approach used by the Seventh... by the tax court and the Seventh Circuit are faithful to the general principle recognized by this Court, that it is only amounts which really produce some form of increase in wealth which should be taxable, and that as long as the amount is offset by an obligation to refund, that increase in wealth has not occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.821" offset="11821282">And it is only a review of the total relationship between the parties that a fair evaluation can be made of whether there has been a sufficient transfer of rights to justify taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.721" offset="11876975">The Commissioner's approach is essentially an arbitrary per se rule that disregards the most critical facts to be considered in making that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.119" offset="11918562">The result of using the Commissioner's approach is to distort income, to mischaracterize and misaccount for the actual earning of income, which should be the purpose of good tax accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.772" offset="11997138">For those reasons we believe that the Seventh Circuit and the unanimous tax court properly evaluated the facts before it, and concluded that these were true security deposits, and not some form of disguised advanced payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.920" offset="12281768">And those cases are not challenged here, and Congress has tinkered with the results in Sections 455 and 456 of the code, and has adopted other rules where it saw fit to do so for prepaid subscription income for newspapers and magazines, and for dues to non-profit membership organizations, such as the auto club.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.606" offset="12376436">But otherwise has left them in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.899" offset="12385631">And once what admittedly was a coherent position taken in dissent is behind us in those three cases, it seems to me that the coherent position now in applying the implications of those three cases to the utility's situation is the position that has been taken in the Commissioner's Revenue Ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.595" offset="12484478">Otherwise, you get into what the court of appeals here admitted was functionally similar situations being treated differently, such as getting an advance payment of the twelfth month's rent, or getting a deposit equivalent to the twelfth months rent that will be returned after twelve months of rent has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.662" offset="12584684">Why... there is no possible reason why those two situations should result in different tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.658" offset="12620629">And the tax court and the court of appeals, by enumerating a number of factors to be looked into, has invited an inquiry into whether a prepayment to secure the payment of future income differs from an advance payment of that future income, when there really is no meaningful difference between the two inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.527" offset="12732119">And it is hard to see how any of these factors bear on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.970" offset="12745912">And that is not going to be a criterion for even-handed administration of the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.014" offset="12770154">When the so-called security deposit is given to assure the payment of the future income, it is a receipt of that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.984" offset="12821980">And the only question is the timing of its recognition, and that was settled in this Court's trilogy of cases, that the Commissioner did have authority to insist that when that income is received in advance by the accrual basis taxpayer, he has to recognize it at that time.</text>
