            <text syncTime="14.870" offset="203958">The City of Los Angeles forced Golden State out of business because we refused to settle a labor dispute with the Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.070" offset="232692">This Court held that the city's decision to deny us a franchise was precluded by the language and legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act because Congress intended to allow management and labor full freedom to bargain and to use economic weapons during a labor dispute without government sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.218" offset="313359">Where Congress decrees that specific private conduct shall be free from government sanction and then a sanction is imposed upon that conduct by a city, a classic case for the application of Section 1983 is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.274" offset="373545">This is especially true here, because the improper destruction of a lawful business is a property injury that has been recognized in our courts for 200 years as deserving of full compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="75.705" offset="447314">The rule in our courts under Section 1983 is that cities are fully liable for the consequences of their illegal actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.262" offset="805505">Well, I think that in this case the mere finding of preemption rested upon the proposition that Congress specifically decreed that private parties shall have the right to engage in certain conduct; that is, collective bargaining and the use of economic weapons during a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.458" offset="874260">I think that that is different than the normal type of finding of... of preemption that involves, for example, federal regulatory schemes and more amorphous findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.340" offset="949806">It seems to me that... that what this Court's initial opinion said was that the... was that this case involves mandatory obligations that is... that are imposed upon the city by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.975" offset="1020336">The court's first... first ruling in Golden State reaffirm that the language and legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act evidence clear Congressional intent to ban all municipal coercion at the bargaining table, and that's been accepted federal law since the 1976 ruling in the Machinists case.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.718" offset="1087314">This is not a case like Pennhurst in which Congress has exhorted rather than commanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.653" offset="1107063">Equally important, this mandatory ban on municipal coercion was intended for the especial benefit of unions and employers like Golden State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.570" offset="8434723">But the reason I believe that the language in the statute should be clear and unambiguous, as Pennhurst indicates, in order to find a legislative intent to create rights within the meaning of 1983, because, to digress a moment, in a preemption case this Court is trying to further some kind of national policy or promote some type of national goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.260" offset="8545483">That is not the issue in a 1983 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.994" offset="8556454">The issue in a 1983 case focuses on whether or not Congress intended to grant rights to the specific individual who is asserting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.960" offset="8588323">And it's certainly to be presumed, if Congress intends to create substantive rights to... of others engage in such action or forbearance of those rights demand, that Congress will use in the particular statute such unambiguous language so as to command such action or forbearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.670" offset="8667109">In other words, to put such persons on notice as what is expected from them, because, after all, the reason that Congress creates rights is to have others honor those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.492" offset="8722384">Now, looking at the statutory language of 8(d) as amended in the... the NLRA and its legislative history, it indicate that that was not Congress' intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.081" offset="8772748">What does 8(d) say as amended?</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.142" offset="8793019">All 8(d) says is that the obligation to bargain in good faith does not compel a party to reach an agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2269.583" offset="9222785">Now, as far as the legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act, counsel makes reference to the fact that the Act talks in terms of the rights of the employer and employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.606" offset="9294883">But what the Act says in 29 U.S.C. 141, it talks about the legitimate rights of these parties in their relations with each other, and the purpose is, according to 141 of the National Labor Relations Act, is to avoid industrial strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.099" offset="9376803">You look at the declared purpose of the National Labor Relations Act, and all it speaks of is the obligations to the parties in reference to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.515" offset="9414524">And as far as 8(d) itself is concerned, that amendment... or, rather, it was amended in 1947 to provide what is a relevant language in this case, namely, the refusal to make a concession does not come within... is... is not a requirement in order to bargain in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.863" offset="9523925">And as far as that specific language is concerned, the congressional Service, discussing the House bill and the Senate bill as to that language, said that the reason for that language was that the board was requiring employers to make concessions to show that they were bargaining in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.495" offset="9618384">That language had a very specific purpose, because the legislature felt that the National Labor Relations Board was, in effect, going too far in putting pressure on an employer in its bargaining with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.864" offset="9683899">And, in fact, this Court in Porter Company v. National Labor Relations Board, in talking about that specific language, pointed out the reason for it is that unless Congress writes into the law guides for the board to follow, the board may attempt to carry this process still further and seek to control more and more of the terms of collecting bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.323" offset="9777731">I submit the reason for that language was not meant to give an employer, as in this case, rights against a third party, but it was meant to, in effect, control what the legislature saw as an abuse of power by the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.767" offset="12523514">And the reason that I'm saying... saying that the city should have notice, it's not because they can claim, well, they didn't... some kind of good-faith defense, which the Court, of course, has already rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.778" offset="12571579">The question is if you're looking at legislative intent, does the legislature intend to create these enforceable rights in a plaintiff?</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.196" offset="12613270">It's fair to say that the Congress can speak in a very clear way to so indicate to the defendant or to the governmental entity what they are expected to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.472" offset="12662381">One other point I would like to make that if... it was pointed out in the brief of the amicus that the question in this case does... does not really address the issue that is really involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.371" offset="12741897">As I said, the issue in this case is whether or not the law... namely, the National Labor Relations Act... created the... the kind of rights that plaintiff is asserting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.695" offset="12779200">And the issue in this case only relates to that particular law, this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.379" offset="12809920">It's not a question, as the question presented by the Court, is whether or not the state action was preempted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.250" offset="12845447">The question is whether or not this law creates that kind of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.561" offset="12858717">And it's fair to say that, if the question is presented in that way that the NLRB may have come into the case as an amicus to give their expertise as to whether or not this particular statute does create such rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.709" offset="12935308">In fact, this Court in Owens v. City of Independence said in determining whether or not a 1983 action lies will look to see whether or not the municipality has conformed to the requirements of the federal Constitution and statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.731" offset="13035409">And in this case there is... the way, again, the way the statute is worded, the city did not in any way disregard any command of Section 8(d).</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.751" offset="13143452">The legislative intent underlying the National Labor Relations Act was fully revealed in Golden State and before it in Machinists, and I think it's important for the Court to bear in mind the broad context of the federal labor laws in which this case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.636" offset="13203011">This Court repeatedly has recognized that free collective bargaining is the cornerstone of the federal labor scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.148" offset="13229029">Bargaining can't be free and unfettered as intended by Congress if management or labor can be punished for their stance at the bargaining table.</text>
