            <text syncTime="18.343" offset="212792">Mr. Prince, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William T. Prince</label>
            <text syncTime="22.235" offset="228361">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.956" offset="231182">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.640" offset="241944">The issue in this case is whether the workers who maintain and repair ship-loading equipment at a waterfront situs are engaged in longshoring operations and therefore are covered by the Longshore and Harborworkers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.545" offset="329611">The Supreme Court of Virginia says they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.378" offset="340896">The... when the Supreme Court of Virginia was first faced with the identical issue, there were very few federal reported cases that gave any guidance at all, and that was in 1977 and the case was Ralph White against the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.034" offset="439535">In this case, the three cases that are now before the Court, the three employees, like Ralph White, were engaged in the maintenance and repair of longshore equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.234" offset="504318">Each brought a... a claim against the railway company under the Federal Employers Liability Act claiming damages caused by employer negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.377" offset="572864">In each of the cases, the railway company gained dismissal on the ground that the employees were engaged in longshoring operations and that their exclusive remedy was under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.557" offset="645589">That was the exact situation that prevailed in 1977 in the Ralph White case, and if I may, the Ralph White case is important in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.300" offset="712567">Ralph White was an electrician who worked on the piers in Norfolk at Lambert's Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.474" offset="753318">His work was the repair and the maintenance of... of the apparatus... excuse me, the electrical apparatus... that was used to run to coal loading machinery at Lambert's Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.607" offset="821863">Not only did Ralph White repair the machinery that kept the operation going, but he actually went on board ships and, on some occasions, he actually worked on scaffolding attached to the piers oh... over the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.819" offset="902633">The Supreme Court of Virginia held in 1977 that Ralph White was not engaged in longshoring operations because he did not manually handle cargo, or he did not actually operate the machinery that kept the... the operation going.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.977" offset="999287">Now, that was in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.698" offset="1018199">By mid-1980, nearly all of the circuit court judges in Virginia who had the same, or nearly the same issue come before them, had stopped following the Supreme Court of Virginia in its Ralph White case and had started following the decisions of this Court in Northeast Terminal v. Caputo and Pfeiffer v. Ford, and especially the opinions of the federal circuit courts of appeal, especially the 4th Circuit, and the Benefits Review Board opinions which were interpreting this Court's opinions in Caputo and Pfeiffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.081" offset="1219760">The Court in Caputo said that Congress intended expanded coverage, and in Pfeiffer you said that Congress intended a simple, uniform standard of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.637" offset="1313905">By mid-1980, the federal circuits and the Benefits Review Board had worked out, following Caputo and Ford, a... essentially consistent interpretation that was uniform and simple in factual situations like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.472" offset="1409304">But in 1988, when these three cases reached the Supreme Court of Virginia, the court... the Virginia court... rejected the reasoning of the federal courts and rejected the reasoning of the many decisions of the Benefits Review Board and specifically reapplied its reasoning in the Ralph White case, holding that these three employees were, in effect, janitors and were not involved in longshoring operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.492" offset="1581399">Let me tell you for a few minutes about what these three employees did.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.364" offset="1600834">They were... two were employed by the C&amp;O Railway, which is now CSX Transportation, and one was employed by Norfolk &amp; Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.720" offset="1638242">Nancy Schwalb and William McGlone worked for the coal loading facility at C&amp;O at Newport News, and they were engaged in cleaning the equipment that was used in the coal loading operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.634" offset="1721938">The operation at both facilities is the picking up of these coal cars, turning them upside down, dumping the coal into the hoppers, from which they get onto belts and go onto the ship loaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.564" offset="1789647">Now, the two employees working in Newport News had the job of cleaning the... what... what are known as the trunnion rollers.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.893" offset="1838967">These... these are rollers upon which these dumpers move, and in the dumping operation coal unavoidably falls and collects around those trunnion rollers and if that coal is not cleaned away, then the operation will... will come to a stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.127" offset="1923917">They also were involved in cleaning coal that had come off the belts and were... was accumulating under the belts.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.744" offset="1962369">Now the two circuit court Judges... the two Virginia circuit court judges... who heard the jurisdictional evidence both found that the work that Nancy Schwalb and William McGlone were doing was essential to the coal loading operation, and that if it was not done, that operation would come to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.881" offset="2062888">Now, the Supreme Court of Virginia in its decision in this case actually accepts that finding and stated in its opinion that, if the work was not done, the dumpers would malfunction and the conveyer belts would become damaged and the work would be interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.818" offset="2166647">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court, accepting the fact that this work was essential and would cause the... the coal loading to stop if it were not done, said that it was construing this Court's opinion in the Caputo case and that this Court in the Caputo case was saying that if an employee did not actually handle cargo, then he was not engaged in maritime employment or longshoring operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.262" offset="2316485">We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Prince.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.118" offset="2419825">Your Honors, I was saying just before the luncheon recess that the Supreme Court of Virginia had acknowledged in its opinion that the coal loading process would come to a stop if the work was not done that Schwalb and McGlone were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.203" offset="2500178">And then the Supreme Court of Virginia said that it was construing your opinion in Caputo and said that that opinion held that employees who were not actually handling cargo were not involved in the essential elements of longshoring operations and, therefore, these employers were not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.841" offset="2606758">It is also noteworthy that in the Caputo case, you said that an employee who was not involved in the ongoing process of loading was not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.262" offset="2668407">The Virginia Supreme Court specifically stated that it would not adopt an ongoing process test.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.175" offset="2704038">The third employee, the one whose case--</text>

            <text syncTime="650.051" offset="2739564">Actually, I think the... what you have said in the Pfeiffer and Ford cases, that an employee who is involved in an integral part of the loading process is covered, also, the term has been used, "essential elements".</text>
            <text syncTime="670.837" offset="2822738">So any employee who plays even a small part of an integral part is covered, and these employees are all engaged in the repair and maintenance of equipment which would come to a halt if not done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.670" offset="4974078">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.163" offset="4999992">These cases require only that this Court confirm the integral part standard it has already establish and confirm that the standard applies to cover the employees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.500" offset="5045340">The standard is dictated both by the language and by the objectives of the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.314" offset="5068642">The Department of Labor has consistently adopted this interpretation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.226" offset="5084315">The courts of appeals have uniformly applied the same test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.351" offset="5100824">The result has been reliable compensation for all injuries, no matter their size, received by workers loading cargo on the waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.996" offset="5135411">I would like to review how both the language and the objectives of the Longshore Act direct an integral part standard, but first, to clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.683" offset="5174072">The integral part standard is a broad standard based on the types of work that Congress specified to be covered by the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.988" offset="5207300">It is capable of disposing of the majority of status-based disputes that come up under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.104" offset="5231855">Under it, a worker is covered if his work is necessary to keep a loading operation going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.940" offset="5255156">Justice O'Connor, you asked about what principles would limit the application of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.383" offset="5276890">Foremost, the test... a worker must be doing that is essential to the mechanics of loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.935" offset="5303117">So, if there is a chef in a cafeteria on a situs, the chef would not be covered under this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.401" offset="5324955">That might be convenient for the workers, but it's not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.503" offset="5337389">Secondly, just in a pragmatic sense, the 1984 amendments act as an outer boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.898" offset="5362989">It is clear... the courts have a clear signal that workers on those categories are too tenuously related to the work of loading to be covered by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.694" offset="5398202">As Justice Scalia pointed out though, the... the function of the status provision is to select for a type of work, and some types of work... the logic of the status provision includes workers who are outside the geographical location of the situs test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.085" offset="5463718">So that someone who is mining steel, or mining metal that will be used in the ship-loading equipment, would be covered by the logic of the test, but the fact is that that person is never going to be on the situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.684" offset="5514082">That is, the situs and the status test work in tandem to select sort of the intersection of two groups of workers who are covered by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.019" offset="5547414">And... finally, I would... I would say that the status provision does select most workers on the waterfront, and that is the point of the Longshore Act, is to cover those workers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.487" offset="6941308">The second feature of the language that I think is worth noting is that Congress defined coverage by establish... establishing as a universe of workers that were covered all those that were engaged in maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.150" offset="7000031">That is, it used a term which, as the Court made clear in Perini, had been given a broad meaning before 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.093" offset="7031796">Then, making explicit that the list was not exhaustive, it specified the named categories of workers who were engaged in maritime employment... that is, longshorers, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.362" offset="7080802">It then repeated the functions of those workers in the situs provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.793" offset="7098565">Attention to the objectives of the statute makes it even clearer that Congress wrote broadly and functionally when it wrote the status provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.529" offset="7133464">It wrote functionally because it was responding... it was reforming a system in which injury had depended only on the location... in which recovery had depended only on the location of an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.966" offset="7175260">It wrote broadly because it did not want the new line to become as arbitrary as the old line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.730" offset="7198353">It needed a flexible line to make account... make allowance for new technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.674" offset="7222072">In this case, the loading operation is almost wholly automated, so that if technology reduces manual functions, a line that would... would cover longshorers would have to cover those who are doing maintenance and repair, if it wasn't to be quite arbitrary and only cover the people who flipped the switch as opposed to the people who repaired the switch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.330" offset="7316740">Second, Congress wanted a simple, rational standard that would cover all who were on the waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.403" offset="7340981">It therefore declined to import distinctions like the point of rest that the Court rejected in Pfeiffer and in Northeast Marine Terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.010" offset="7371388">A rational coverage of all those engaged in longshoring operations would cover those who were working with the same equipment and were exposed to the same hazards, and those who should... should merit the same compensation whether they are repairing the equipment or operating it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.983" offset="7515270">We appear before you this afternoon on behalf of Nancy Schwalb, William McGlone and Robert Goode, three railroad workers who were injured while they were on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.872" offset="7570859">We do not agree that these workers were engaged in maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.076" offset="7591652">The issue before the Court is whether these three railroad employees are covered for their work-related injuries by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, which was passed in 1908 to benefit railroad workers, or by the Longshore and Harborworkers' Compensation Act, which was originally enacted in 1927 to provide benefits for longshore and harborworkers not covered by state workers' compensation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.584" offset="7709726">We suggest that a review of the legislative history of the Longshore Act and the amendments to that act in 1972, together with a review of this Court's decisions since the enactment of the 1972 amendments to the Longshore Act, will cause you to decide that these railroad workers should be treated as railroad workers and not as longshore and harborworkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.932" offset="7811081">Your decision here today will not affect longshore and harborworkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.364" offset="7828844">It will only apply to a limited number of railroad workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.537" offset="7845562">Nancy... Nancy Schwalb and William McGlone held jobs as laborers at the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.804" offset="7878581">They performed housekeeping and janitorial services in offices, in shops, in bathrooms, locker rooms and at other places situated on the railroad's pier and adjacent property in Newport News, Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.975" offset="12375300">Well, that's the status test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.618" offset="12381882">In that opinion, it was noted that an earlier decision, the Caputo decision, had specifically rejected a point of rest theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.067" offset="12447607">We suggest that what the railroad is arguing here today is asking the Court to readopt a point of rest theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.893" offset="12482924">The point of rest theory was based on cargo being off-loaded from a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.577" offset="12509673">It came to rest at some point where it was no longer moving on the shore, and that was where the longshoring activity stopped and some other activity began.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.586" offset="12557739">In the Caputo decision, that theory was specifically rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.110" offset="12575816">We suggest that the railroad here today is asking the Court to readopt a similar type of theory, only in the converse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.495" offset="12609357">That is, the coal is mined in the mountains and is brought by the railroad car down... cars down to the railroad yard in Norfolk, where the railroad cars stop, and then at some point the cars are then assembled for moving onto the ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.960" offset="12695247">Now, we would suggest that that... if that is where the longshoring activity starts, that would be readopting a theory that has been specifically been rejected here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.410" offset="12741014">Again, you have to focus on what these employees were doing at the time and what their jobs were... at the time they were hurt, and what their jobs were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.204" offset="12772256">They were railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.196" offset="12784168">They did not handle cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.187" offset="12792109">They did not unload ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.350" offset="12804753">They did not load ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.132" offset="12811962">In fact, for Schwalb and McGlone, they were specifically prohibited from handling the cargo and placing it back on the conveyer belts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.136" offset="12851982">It's also the... in Mr. McGlone's case, it's particular... particularly important because he was injured in a place where... the same place where he was injured in this case a year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.158" offset="12920005">He suffered an injury on the job, working as a laborer in the same location, and the railroad adjusted that case under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.355" offset="12960860">He made a claim under the FELA and it was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.127" offset="12971936">It's part of the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.239" offset="12976325">A year later, in 1983, he suffered another injury doing the same job in the same location, working the same area, with the same duties, and now the railroad denies his FELA claim and asserts that he's not covered by that, and we would suggest that nothing has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.441" offset="13065141">What has changed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.212" offset="13068276">The act was amended in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.605" offset="13081860">The... this Court decided the Caputo case in 1977, the four... Pfeiffer case in 1979, and here, McGlone gets hurt in 1982 and his case is settled under FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.274" offset="13132433">A year later, he gets hurt doing the same sort of thing and the claim is denied, based on jurisdictional coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.290" offset="13168586">The only difference, the only distinction of these two situations is, in the second case he suffered a very serious injury and his arm has been permanently disabled and disfigured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.871" offset="13230862">He's permanently disabled from returning the railroad work, and the only difference is the severity of his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.326" offset="13256671">Now, we suggest that what the railroad has done is made an administrative decision that it's cheaper to handle the case, or adjust the case, through the Longshore Act, rather than through the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.595" offset="13305781">And, of course, this would be a way of handling the case we again would state the Congress never intended the... to apply to these type of workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.481" offset="13345278">We would further assert that if what the goal of the railroad would be would be to have a long... a Worker's Compensation Act for railroad employees--</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.127" offset="13487907">Well, Your Honor, would... the... and... I... the point is that it's an expansion of a workers comp statute, and traditionally there has been never a workers comp statute for railroad workers and if that's what's sought here, we suggest that should be handled legislatively rather than expanded judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.490" offset="13577350">We urge that the Court remember what job Goode was performing when he was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.757" offset="13682467">He was the mechanic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.988" offset="13691349">He was repairing the railroad equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.402" offset="13700962">He was repairing a retarder, which is part of the braking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.604" offset="13721755">He was not loading a ship; he was not unloading a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.407" offset="13737011">He was working on a piece of railroad equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.959" offset="13747251">This issue of what constitutes maritime employment was most recently before this Court in Herb's Welding v. Gray in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.340" offset="13812766">Gray was a welder who worked on an off-shore drilling platform off the Louisiana coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.225" offset="13844322">When he was hurt doing a welding job, be filed a claim for benefits under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.818" offset="13870653">This Court held that he was not entitled to benefits because he was not engaged in maritime employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.925" offset="13903045">The opinion reviewed both the situs and the status requirements for coverage under the act and concluded that Congress' purpose when the Longshore Act was amended was to cover those workers on a covered situs who were involved in the essential elements of the loading or unloading or construction of vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.099" offset="13979740">The Court held that Gray... Gray's welding was far removed from such traditional longshoring activities and it was, therefore, not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.133" offset="14011923">Reviewing the expansion of the definition of the situs test and the addition in the amended act of the status test, the Court recognized the intended limitations of coverage, and it stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.027" offset="14087469">"Congress did not seek to cover all those who breathe salt air. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.261" offset="14104397">There is a limit to the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.073" offset="14115682">The Pfeiffer case stated that the maritime employment requirement is an occupational test that focuses on loading and unloading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.431" offset="14157164">The amendments were not meant to cover employees not engaged in loading, unloading, repairing or building a vessel, just because they are injured in an area adjoining navigable waters used for such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.278" offset="14204498">We urge the Court here to follow these precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.404" offset="14224978">None of these railroad workers were engaged in essential elements of loading or unloading a vessel.</text>
