            <text syncTime="90.293" offset="496840">Mr. James, the Petitioner, was found guilty of murder and attempted murder arising out of a shooting incident in Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.172" offset="796307">They also testified that at the time of the shooting Petitioner was wearing what they called a butter-style hair... hair which is a slicked back hair, reddish-brown in color.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.012" offset="847716">That was the substance of the state's case, was the eyewitness testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.988" offset="875615">For the defense, in addition to presenting a police officer who had interviewed some of the eye witnesses and who related certain prior inconsistent statements, Petitioner called a friend of the family named Jewel Henderson, who testified that on the day of the... shooting she had taken Petitioner to a high school to transfer, to pick up his transcripts and to register at another high school and on that day his hair was, in fact, black and among other things he was not wearing an earring, also.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.437" offset="1001421">That was also testified to by the state's other eyewitnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.120" offset="1016154">At this point, the prosecution asked the Court, or announced to the Court that it wished to use Petitioner's suppressed statements for the purpose of, as it was erroneously called, impeaching or rebutting Miss Henderson's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.101" offset="1080102">Defense counsel objected on Fourth Amendment grounds, calling, of course, attention to the fact that this Court's decisions had only allowed the use of tainted evidence to impeach the testimony of the Defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.078" offset="1132033">The trial court rejected that argument but did hold a voluntariness hearing at which the two arresting officers testified, and having found the statements to have been voluntary, the court ruled that they could be used, as he put it, to impeach and rebut Miss Henderson's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.052" offset="1199847">Thereafter, Officer... Officer Glynn, one of the arresting officers testified and related, in essence that in the squad car he asked the Defendant what his hair color was the day before and Mr. James responded that it was reddishbrown and combed straight back.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.962" offset="1271527">Later, approximately two hours, I believe, at the police station, he was interrogated again and at that point, he reiterated that the color was brown and he also was asked what... what he was doing at the beauty parlor, and according to the detective Respondent... or Petitioner stated he was there to get his hair dyed black and curled to change his appearance, and all of those statements were... were used... were presented to the jury in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.701" offset="1386466">Counsel for Petitioner requested a limiting instruction to the effect that these statements could not be used as evidence of guilt, but only as bearing on the credibility of Miss Henderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.769" offset="1434740">The trial court refused the written instruction tendered by the defense but did give an oral instruction which in effect said that this testimony was offered to prove that his hair was black... I'm sorry, was red.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.516" offset="4845705">But in... in this very case, the police officers knew when they took Mr. James into custody that there were several eye witnesses to the offense and that if they ever... if they ever found the right person they would probably get identifications and they wouldn't need the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.399" offset="4913310">And the first... the first question they asked him, as a matter of fact, was what was the color of his hair, and I think that was clearly... they... they were trying to get statements that would conform to what they knew of the offense already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.658" offset="4958345">The danger is that... we don't maintain that the police would have to think specifically about what possible specific testimony might be given that it might be useful for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.093" offset="5000036">It's just the overall message that if... if you adopt this rule, that now we can use unlawfully obtained statement or physical evidence, I... I suppose would apply to Miranda violations as well, whenever the Defendant puts on any kind of inconsistent evidence in his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.729" offset="5082583">And again, it's not based on a right to do so, but if the police perceive a value to it I think that's, as this Court has held, you look at the common sense assumptions on their behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.806" offset="5134933">Furthermore, I... I think one further ramification of this rule is if the Court does approve the... use... the substantive use in rebuttal I don't see how that could not apply to the Defendant's own testimony and therefore that under the... the requirement of Harris and Havens that there be written instructions, I don't think it would any longer really apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.759" offset="5382678">Your Honors, it was nearly 20 years ago, in Harris, this Court said to the extent that there is a deterrent effect from the exclusionary... exclusionary rule, sufficient deterrence flows when the evidence becomes unavailable for the state's case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.659" offset="5450283">The Solicitor General, writing as amicus for the state in this case, has suggested that this case is an appropriate vehicle for this Court to draw that as the bright line, and Your Honors, the people of Illinois agree with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.000" offset="5511723">Your Honors, there are two steps to draw that line that must be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.095" offset="5540040">First, it's the step from direct examination of the defendant to direct examination of a witness and then to cross-examination of a witness, and then there's also the related step of... the step of impeachment to rebuttal evidence, and, Your Honors, in terms of deterrent effect, those steps the state proposes are very, very small steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.712" offset="5638469">Your Honors, look to a policeman trying to make the decision whether to cross the threshold or not, whether to ask the question or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.340" offset="5689042">He doesn't know what the answer is, and... but he does know... he probably doesn't know what the answer is going to be or what he's going to find, but what does he know?</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.418" offset="5729375">He knows that whatever he gets is going to be lost to him for the case in chief if he doesn't take the time to do it right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.991" offset="11691667">Well, as a matter of fact, that may have aided their probable cause argument, but that's the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.066" offset="11723955">They didn't do that, among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.620" offset="11734195">The evidence is not set out, but the arrest was based on... two boys on the street came by and said, we heard rumors that Romeo, who the police said was the Petitioner's nickname, may have done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.399" offset="11777245">And based on that, they went and picked him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.749" offset="11786649">I think it's pretty clear, as the trial court found, that there was no probable cause here and the police couldn't have believed that they had probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.054" offset="11811935">So this... I think this rule would both encourage carelessness, but I think it would also encourage deliberate violations of Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.532" offset="11853836">As... as far as, again, whether a police officer has to sit down and think this through, I don't think that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.401" offset="11897303">I think the message will be that the restrictions on the use of this kind of evidence have been greatly relaxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.457" offset="11933457">It's... it'll be valuable to us to get it, so if you can't get it another way, and especially, as in this case, if the prospect of having independent evidence is very high, where you know you have several eyewitnesses, then I think that the... the deterrent, or the incentive, is there and I think I'll close with that, unless the Court has any other questions.</text>
