            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="208675">The issue in this civil rights case is whether Respondent Mitchell, an attorney, can by enforcing a contingent fee contract require Petitioner Juan Francisco Venegas, who is the client and the prevailing party in the civil right action, to pay over $800,000 in attorney's fees when the court awarded, pursuant to Section 1988, fees in the amount to the then-attorneys of $102,000, which was almost twice the amount of the lodestar and twice the amount requested and which included a contingency enhancement factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.283" offset="356737">In short, the issue is whether 1988 is to operate as a fee-sharing statute or a fee-shifting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.705" offset="390383">Now, prior to Mitchell the case had been pending some eight years.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.882" offset="555163">There was a high probability of a large recovery, in that in the state court a jury had awarded a million dollars, which was reversed on the basis of sovereign immunity, which, of course, was a defense not available in a civil rights action.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.625" offset="610125">Mr. Mitchell had Mr. Venegas pay him a $10,000 non-refundable retainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.779" offset="634680">That meant he kept it win, lose or draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.481" offset="645547">And had him sign his standard contingent fee contract, which provided for 40 percent of the recovery for one trial only, plus he would keep any civil rights award which exceeded that amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.260" offset="828613">And indeed, the court of appeals when it said that Mr. Venegas had the burden of showing that 40 percent contingency was unusual in a civil rights action, never drew that distinction, that this was 40 percent for one trial only.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.471" offset="901442">And as a matter of fact, the way Petitioner Venegas construed it, which was not unreasonable, was that if he lost, Mr. Mitchell would not have to do the trial... do the appeal without extra consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.581" offset="953896">But that in order to effect the recovery, he had to do the appeal and undertake the recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.623" offset="3374089">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.423" offset="3377328">The first question presented really goes to the Court's ability to... which it has done in each and every case... to basically take what's a skeletal statute and carry out its purposes and intent by a number of rules, which has been referred to by Judge Posner in his book on Federal courts as a type of Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.122" offset="3472100">For instance, let me give one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.158" offset="3480251">There is nothing in Section 1988 that provides a different statutory guideline as between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.465" offset="3529465">Not a word.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.598" offset="3533958">And indeed, there are a number of statutes which statutorily provide for such a distinction between the standard for defendants and for plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.689" offset="3574396">The... the... one of them is the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act, the Petroleum Marketing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.843" offset="3598951">A number of acts have that specific distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.712" offset="3610445">Nevertheless, this Court in Hughes v. Roe in 1980 judicially enacted that... different standards on the grounds that it carries out the purposes and the intent of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.353" offset="3664989">Now, respondent has simply said, well, what about all these other fee limitation statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="885.006" offset="3687663">Congress knows how to say it or do it and, therefore, they didn't do it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.577" offset="3705949">And the answer to that is that those fee limitation statutes are basically dedicated toward protecting a particular group of people, coal miners, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.552" offset="3749834">They also... the purpose is to protect the Federal fisc because they are normally Federal statutes, and in some instances to make the process less adversarial.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.776" offset="3798735">Here we have a fee shifting contract which is not a fee limitation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.228" offset="3816499">There is no limitation on what the attorney can obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.381" offset="3833113">Basically, the only limitation is what the court deems to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.917" offset="3851294">Now, the... the other argument... two other arguments that defendant... respondent has made, and that is, this just involves the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant and it doesn't involve his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.677" offset="3910331">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.962" offset="3915451">The statute deals with attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.479" offset="3925482">It doesn't provide that the defendant shall pay plaintiff monies which he can then use to pay his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.318" offset="3952858">It deals with a reasonable attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.520" offset="3969681">It also... it's clear that Congress intended that the recovery not be reduced by what the plaintiff must pay his... his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.042" offset="4003744">And that's stated in Blanchard v. Bergeron.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.660" offset="4014193">I might add that if we assume that Congress is rational and that they act on the basis of... of case law as it exists, back in 1948 and the Fair Labor Standards case the Second Circuit, the Judges Hand and Jerome Frank enunciated a proposition which was then picked up by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.293" offset="4112727">I think they said it better than I can say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.478" offset="4125475">And it said, it seems to us too clear for argument that Congress did not intend the court to fix a fee sufficient to compensate the plaintiff's attorney for all his services and to permit him to collect an additional fee from his client under a private agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.023" offset="4191722">Such an agreement... such an arrangement would require the cooperation of the court in the frustration of congressional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.045" offset="4223800">Moreover, in this case the fee, by contract, belongs to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.616" offset="4250027">He said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.333" offset="4256923">And finally, it seems to me that if the attorney is to be a co-venturer in this project, he should have the same risks, and the risk is what does the judge determine as his reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.292" offset="4304780">He should also have the risk, parenthetically, of having to undergo the obligation which the plaintiff has of paying the defendant in the event that the defendant is the prevailing party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.610" offset="4422017">So, one might say that the fee awarded by the court here was a reasonable fee, and one might also say that the... that the 40 percent contract agreement provided for a reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.369" offset="4473113">I mean, there's a vast range of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.737" offset="4482517">Why couldn't Congress have intended that it's up to the court, the court will pick a reasonable fee that will be awarded to... to counsel so that plaintiff doesn't have to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.962" offset="4535493">But if... if plaintiff has contractually obligated himself to pay more, that's something Congress didn't... didn't address.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.659" offset="6782233">And it seems to me... it seems to us that... that that... once having determined that that's reasonable, a plaintiff's attorney should not be able to ask for what is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.200" offset="6828417">Now, it's true there are other... there's a whole range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.837" offset="6846912">I mean, for example, it could have been one-seventeen or one... by the way, the extra $15,000 went to a prior attorney who is now suing for six times that amount in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.812" offset="6890797">So that the attorneys, unfortunately, are not satisfied with whatever the judges are pronouncing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.299" offset="6916815">And what happens is... is that, unless this Court sets down some standard, it seems to me that we are going to have more of this collateral litigation between unfortunate civil rights plaintiffs and their attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.408" offset="6981181">And finally, in connection with what the court did below, they placed the burden on Venegas, which is wrong; they ignored the circumstances at the time, which was an inadequate disclosure of the availability of Section 1988; they ignored the disparity; and they deemed reasonable a contract with is manifestly unenforceable under state and Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.994" offset="7095597">So, for all these reasons we believe that, number one, the Court should adopt the rule that Section 1988 precludes the attorney from receiving more than the court-awarded fee, and if it doesn't emanate from Section 1988, it emanates from what this Court... or at least the dissent said in the Mallard case, and the... and the majority opinion did not indicate to the contrary... that the Court has an inherent power to regulate the attorney, a special relationship regardless of whatever a statute says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.815" offset="7426830">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.719" offset="7450445">As the questions from the Court indicate, the central question in this case is whether Congress, in passing Section 1988, intended to restrict or limit in any way the amount that an attorney could charge his client in a civil rights case and specifically whether Congress intended that the reasonable fee awarded to the prevailing party is the limit on what an attorney can charge that prevailing party pursuant to its own fee agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.606" offset="7586073">The position that the petitioner argues in this case would prevent an attorney from enforcing any type of contract... a contingency fee contract, as in this case, a fixed-fee contract and a contract based on an hourly rate basis... any kind of contract that would yield a fee higher than the amount set by the court under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.126" offset="7696100">Did Congress intend that result by this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.745" offset="7710624">I think the answer to that has to be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.280" offset="7720760">Nothing on the face of the statute indicates that Congress intended any such intention or that it even addressed the question, for Section 1988 does not address the question of what a prevailing party may voluntarily pay to his lawyer in a civil rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.443" offset="7801322">Section 1988 deals with what a losing party must pay by order of the court to the prevailing party as a reasonable attorney's fee in a civil rights case, not... it is not what may... what parties voluntarily contract before a case is decided to pay for legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.177" offset="7908319">Rather, it is how much a losing party involuntarily may be taxed by the court as an additional recovery to the prevailing party, in this case the plaintiff, to assist in covering the attorney's fee or costs of the case to the prevailing party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2538.178" offset="10300300">That issue has since become moot, and it's become moot because subsequent to the decision of the court of appeals on the merits of the case the plaintiff, Mr. Venegas, entered into a settlement agreement and that settlement agreement established an escrow account for the amount of fee in dispute here and it sits in escrow awaiting the final judgment as to who's entitled to the attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.927" offset="10599349">They concluded that they should not accept Mr. Mitchell's proposal for handling the appeal and instead Mr. Bromberg agreed to handle it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.749" offset="10626621">And he, thereafter, represented Mr. Venegas and he represented Mr. Venegas in the trial court on the question of the enforceability of the contingent fee contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.688" offset="10666327">And he made... advanced a number of arguments why it shouldn't be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.377" offset="10701122">They were all considered by Judge Kelleher pursuant to the Ninth Circuit's decision in a case called Hamner v. Rios.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.031" offset="10731738">And that court sets forth a rather broad standard for lower courts to follow in assessing the reasonableness of attorney's private fee arrangements in civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.089" offset="10775937">And Judge Kelleher cited that case, referred to the standards, indicated that he had a broad discretion to apply, then considered the arguments that had been advanced by the... Mr. Venegas, including the claim that it was a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.348" offset="10829018">And Judge Kelleher, who had seen the trial... he saw the job that the attorney, Mr. Mitchell, had done and knew the facts of the case... concluded that this was a reasonable agreement and ought to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.538" offset="10873740">And the Ninth Circuit sustained that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.073" offset="10883875">So we don't see that there's anything left to be decided on the issue of the enforceability of the contract if this Court affirms the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.487" offset="12509527">And if a civil rights lawyer felt confident and knew that in taking one of these cases... not necessarily one that would have this much damages, but any civil rights case... that he... that if his client prevailed, he would receive a statutory fee from the court, that he would... might be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.317" offset="12584864">But unfortunately that's not the situation today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.269" offset="12596672">Because of this Court's decision in Evans v. Jeff D. most civil rights plaintiffs' lawyers in most cases are at grave risk of receiving no fee whatsoever, despite their efforts on the clients' behalf and successful efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.660" offset="12654246">And that's because the vast majority of civil rights cases settle, as the vast majority of all cases do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.683" offset="12678383">And cities and municipalities who are usually the defendants, have caught on to the way... the fact that the way you settle these cases is to get the plaintiff to waive attorney's fees under the statute, particularly a case that's been complex and long-standing and where the fees promise to be fairly substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.060" offset="12751839">So an attorney, in a civil rights context, is at great risk now, as Mitch... and Mr. Mitchell has been the victim of this on several occasions, as our brief shows, doing a lot of work, achieving the essential results sought by the plaintiff, or his client, and then having a settlement made in which a condition of settlement is that his fee is waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.724" offset="12834491">Of course, in that situation, particularly where the defendant offers the client essentially the relief sought, subject only to fee-waiver, an ethical lawyer like Mr. Mitchell is in a tough bind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.866" offset="12883078">He can't tell his lawyer not to accept the settlement just because he's not being paid his fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.852" offset="12903036">So he counsels acceptance of a settlement that achieves the law... the client's basic objectives and in the process talks himself out of his statutory based fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.225" offset="12944518">Now, unless he's got some protection under a lawyer's fee contract, he's going to be out in the cold, and that's why civil rights plaintiffs' lawyers are going to be discouraged from taking these cases unless the right to contract, as in this case, is sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.638" offset="13226118">Nothing prevents the district court from considering that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.839" offset="13238971">That's an appropriate consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.958" offset="13247434">In this case, consideration of that would be as follows, I think, because fortunately as... unlike other cases, we have sort of a benchmark here as to what the client's loss was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.449" offset="13297380">And the petitioner himself has said he had a state court antecedent proceeding in which he was awarded damages of a million dollars, which was reversed on state law grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.722" offset="13338445">And says the petitioner, this case was easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.091" offset="13347953">He already knew he had a million dollar suit here, and all Mr. Mitchell had to do was try it and collect a millon dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.478" offset="13373553">In this case... it wasn't that easy, by the way, for reasons I'll come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.299" offset="13388809">But in this case Mr. Mitchell secured a judgment of $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.750" offset="13406572">Venegas went out and got the best he could find, and it produced a result twice what the so-called benchmark was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.558" offset="13445860">So, even after you deduct the 40 percent Mr. Mitchell and his colleague are entitled under... to under their contract, the client here has been made more than whole by any sort of generalized benchmark standard one can look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.032" offset="13495702">So, on the facts of this case, which is what the plaintiff has tendered here, certainly it's not unreasonable to enforce the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.536" offset="14137792">And that is did Congress provide, as it could have, that there should be limitations on the enforceability of fee contracts when they exceed the amount awarded under the 1988 provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.863" offset="14191082">Congress has shown its ability to do that in a variety of situations when it has wanted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.016" offset="14215637">But I would like to leave with the sort of the fountainhead case in this area that started all of this to begin with, the Alyeska case, which is the case that led the Congress to enact Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.574" offset="14265896">And there, in rejecting the notion that the court should on its own conclude to award plaintiff's attorney's fees in successful civil rights cases, Justice White's opinion for the Court said that that approach would make... I'm quoting now... would make major inroads on a policy matter that Congress has reserved for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.905" offset="14351264">And in rejecting the rule in that case that had been adopted by the court below, this Court said that the law concerning attorney's fees,</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.843" offset="14387000">"is deeply rooted in our history and in congressional policy. "</text>
