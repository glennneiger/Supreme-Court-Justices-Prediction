            <text syncTime="28.583" offset="259475">This case is brought before this Court on the State of Illinois' petition for certiorari to the Illinois Appellate Court, First Judicial District, Third Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.475" offset="303047">This matter involves the consensual entry into an apartment by the Chicago police to effectuate the immediate arrest of Edward Rodriguez for a brutal, aggravated battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.133" offset="357695">In the course of the arrest controlled substances were found which were later suppressed by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.222" offset="389983">Illinois asks this Court to find that the court below committed error when it affirmed the trial court's suppression of evidence by failing to recognize that a police officer's reasonable reliance on a third party's apparent authority to allow consensual entry is a valid exception to the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.254" offset="482143">In this case, the police arrived at 3554 South Wolcott in Chicago, which was the home of Dorothy Johnson, the stepmother of Gail Fisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.645" offset="527700">The police found at that location the victim of a brutal, aggravated battery.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.133" offset="665627">She went on to tell the police that she would sign complaints for aggravated battery and allow the officers to enter that apartment to effectuate the arrest of Ed Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.959" offset="716931">She indicated to the police officers that she would allow them to enter through the use of a key that she described as "my key".</text>
            <text syncTime="151.129" offset="749636">She also told the officers that items of her personal ownership... furniture, stove, a refrigerator and other personal property... was still present in that apartment.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.225" offset="1150041">I think that's primarily the ruling in Stoner v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.943" offset="1164879">You can't ignore the fact that a person who is a motel clerk does not have the ability to gain... to give entry into an apartment.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.001" offset="1213153">In this case the victim, whose jaw we later found was broken, certainly was distorted and extended, the victim of a brutal, aggravated battery, indicated to the police that this had just occurred in an apartment that she described as "our apartment".</text>
            <text syncTime="284.279" offset="1282221">And so it was reasonable under the information given to the police, including the fact that most of her belongings were still in that apartment, that we don't have in this case a situation where ignorance is bliss.</text>

Garrison, this Court asked the question whether a warrant that permitted entry into one house but not another, but was inadvertently executed by entering the second house, was a valid entry and the Court held that it was a valid entry because in the process of executing a warrant the officers will make reasonable mistakes and, provided that the mistake that they make is reasonable, the Fourth Amendment is not offended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.568" offset="6043403">We think that that is a preferable rule to holding that some sort of good faith exception to the exclusionary rule would be extended and should cover this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.008" offset="6081124">The major reason is that police officers do want to and do try to comply with the Fourth Amendment as they are instructed it applies to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.530" offset="6111217">If this Court should hold that the reasonable appearance of authority is not sufficient, responsible police officers and their supervisors will be forced to instruct their officers: no matter how reasonable it appears to you on the street to accept a consent and go in and take care of enforcing the criminal laws as you see them, you should hesitate and perhaps you should come back and discuss with us, perhaps you should go through and wait to see whether probable cause develops and whether you can get a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.844" offset="6732513">In this case, the government chooses to argue that it was based upon consent, which would require voluntary consent by a person having common authority over the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.735" offset="6776085">And I think it's obvious in this case that the common authority or actual authority of Gail Fisher did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.473" offset="6798969">Consent is really a waiver of a constitutional right, and as we have been instructed in Matlock, the normal situation of a consent would be the defendant himself consenting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.856" offset="7952536">I filed a supplemental record with this Court which was allowed and which was the preliminary hearing that took place September 11, 1985, about two months after the incident.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.726" offset="8188056">Again I would like to go to the... to the scene of what occurred when Dorothy Jackson called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.266" offset="8234136">Dorothy Jackson, of course, being also a deputy sheriff as we learned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.202" offset="8245943">The police arrived at about 2:30 in the afternoon on a Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.837" offset="8260467">It's not a court holiday.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.724" offset="8280007">And upon arrival, Officer Tenza, who did not testify in these proceedings, is a beat officer in a uniform and he questions Dorothy Jackson and Gail Fisher for a few moments and then calls a tactical team as a backup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.716" offset="8331939">Tactical officers, among other chores, are drug investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.520" offset="8347194">They come to the scene and speak to her and I think this... this is an important thing to note... that the whole conversation between Officers Entress and Gutierrez, the two tactical officers, and Gail Fisher and her mother lasted between five and ten minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.510" offset="8403201">Now, if we are going to talk about reasonable police behavior, it would seem that if the conversation only lasted five to ten minutes and they had to discuss the battery, where the battery took place, and then, as the Court will note, they brought up the question of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.253" offset="8462133">And I suggest to the Court that the battery arrest was not the reason that those two officers came there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.989" offset="8489091">Something happened in the conversation with Dorothy Jackson, the mother, and Gail Fisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.226" offset="8509989">We know that now because Dorothy Jackson testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.427" offset="8518871">The police said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.429" offset="8522841">"I heard about Rodriguez before. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.762" offset="8528170">"Isn't he involved in drugs? "</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.728" offset="8532036">And then Entress asked Gail Fisher,</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.381" offset="8542590">"Doesn't he have drugs in the house? "</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.797" offset="8548337">I think he used a foul word and she didn't want to repeat that word but she used the word drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.099" offset="8565473">Didn't he have drugs in the house?</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.118" offset="8569548">Officer Entress, curiously enough, answers that Gail Fisher did not respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.003" offset="8589088">But Dorothy Jackson, the mother, the police officer mother, says, no, my daughter said yes he has drugs in the house, and I concurred and suggested that there were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.460" offset="8626913">Now, I... I would suggest to the Court that at that point we now have a battery situation, but now it has arisen to officers' appearance that there may be drugs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.816" offset="8668396">I suggest that if they had pursued... at this point they still don't have authority... they're more concerned about that... they're not questioning any further with regard... during that five to ten minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.124" offset="8713640">As a matter of fact, even Officer Entress made a statement, and I--</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.233" offset="8977999">They... they didn't ask the right questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.102" offset="8985522">It would have been in a situation where there was no reason to rush, it was three-and-a-half hours later that they arrived there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.356" offset="9014570">The record reflects this beating took place at 11:00 n the morning, by one of the officers, and this is now 2:30.</text>

            <text syncTime="2229.849" offset="9064516">They could have spent another five or ten minutes asking the right questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.717" offset="9079981">And then they... if they got lies, then, of course, the Illinois courts would not approve that, but they could have found out probably that Gail Fisher would have said no, I don't live there, I moved out three weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.941" offset="9124912">And if they had inquired of that, then they would not have gone in with any type of consent and they could have gone and done what they should have done and that is to either arrest him at the door, obtain an arrest warrant, or if they pursued the line of questioning regarding the drugs, I suggest that under Gates, they perhaps could have applied for a search warrant and with the totality test of Gates perhaps would have gotten it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.758" offset="10088099">As this Court is aware, Garrison involved a search warrant, where the police had done an extensive investigation prior to obtaining the search warrant to determine who resided on the third floor of that building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.566" offset="10139403">They went to the building itself and checked the description of the building, which matched the informant's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.518" offset="10159152">They went to the gas and electric company to see if there was anyone other than McWebb, the proposed defendant, living on the third floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.706" offset="10191961">They got a negative answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.673" offset="10195827">They checked with police records and found that the address and physical description matched the description of the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.645" offset="10223726">This is the work that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.829" offset="10232399">When the warrant was executed, of course, we know that they found two apartments on the third floor and then made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.918" offset="10260820">I suggest that that's relevant here because the officers here had certainly ample time to not only ask the right questions, but to do a little further checking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.441" offset="10294884">They could have... they could have checked when they got over there to see if... who was on the doorbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.493" offset="10311080">They could have asked the landlord, perhaps, who was on the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.011" offset="10321111">I mean... or make a phone call or ask the right questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.313" offset="10334381">They had the opportunity to ask the mother, who moved her daughter out three weeks before... and her children out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.617" offset="10359563">And Judge Schreier found that to be very convincing... that her children were present at all times... in fact were there that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.104" offset="10381506">Dorothy Jackson had to have a friend come over to babysit the two young children while she and Gail Fisher were told by the police to go back to Mr. Rodriguez's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.976" offset="10421003">If she wanted to press charges for battery, she had open the door with the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.197" offset="10437930">She was misled and told that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.597" offset="10443468">That, of course, was not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.664" offset="10447752">They did not need her for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.816" offset="10456425">If they wanted to arrest him for battery, which they certainly could have, there would have been a different way to do it and a proper way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.255" offset="10486100">Either by, under Hill, knocking, when answers to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.790" offset="10504281">Or obtaining an arrest warrant, which was certainly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.825" offset="10516402">Or even under Illinois law, they could have sent him a summons in the mail to appear in court for at that time a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.127" offset="10537614">And I note that no felony battery charge was ever filed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.396" offset="10550675">I suggest to this Court that in Payton the Court stated that the magistrate's determination of probably cause will protect the citizen from the zealous officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.155" offset="10601770">I suggest these were zealous officers but the pretext of their going to Rodriguez's apartment was to look for drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.892" offset="10632699">The record certainly supports that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.261" offset="10642103">And again, I suggest that if they wanted to that, they could have avoided all of this problem we have now with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.581" offset="10667390">And they could have obtained, or at least attempted to obtain a search warrant, if they had pursued it correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.152" offset="10685676">And I am certain that that warrant probably would have been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.104" offset="10701558">I hypothetically suggest to you that if the... Gail Fisher had been charged with possession of the cocaine in this house and the marijuana, and she moved to suppress the evidence, that the government would be standing here suggesting to you that she didn't have standing to object to that search because under the facts as we know, she probably did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.100" offset="10781493">She didn't live there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.467" offset="10787031">She had a key, but again, the key without authority is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.919" offset="10800823">And I would suggest that no general authority for common purposes that she probably would not have standing, and I believe standing is a mirror of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.275" offset="10838231">The same elements would apply, in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.660" offset="10847739">Judge Schreier specifically found that... and I think these findings are important, they were upheld by our intermediate appellate court and, of course, the Illinois Supreme Court refused to review it... that Gail Fisher was not a usual resident, let alone an exclusive resident; that she was rather infrequent a visitor, a guest or an invitee; that she did not contribute to the rent; that she was not on the lease... the fact of her having the key was not a substantial piece of information to Judge Schreier; that she was not allowed to be in the apartment when he was not there; that she was like a guest who only had access to the apartment when the host was present.</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.589" offset="11687419">So there is no doubt that the theories of this Court get down to the police on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.059" offset="11705392">And if suppression is upheld in this case, they'll learn that the next time they have a situation like this, they should ask the right questions and perhaps later on some other rule might apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.582" offset="11743426">I would respectfully ask this Court to uphold the decision of the Illinois appellate court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Claps</label>
            <text syncTime="2913.342" offset="11798492">I want to first say that the statement by counsel, although I'm sure it wasn't on purpose, is not correct about what was argued before the trial judge in the suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.548" offset="11843318">And although it's not in the joint appendix, I believe it is in the record that the Court has on page 137, the assistant state's attorney, Gibbons, in arguing to the judge said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.338" offset="11886472">"In that case, Judge, the reason for applying the exclusionary rule in such instances of good faith relied upon the police... relied upon by the police, it would do little in terms of deterring this conduct and future protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.948" offset="11944882">And he goes on to cite United States v. Leon and Massachusetts v. Sheppard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.669" offset="11967765">So the exclusionary concept was argued before the trial judge and it was in our appellate brief... not Leon, but we cited United States v. Calandra and stated the purpose of the exclusionary rule would not be served by the suppression of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.265" offset="12054179">So we did make that argument in the appellate court and the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.069" offset="12069434">And although we didn't put it directly in the question for review in the cert. petition, we did in the body of the cert. petition cite Leon and argue that its the... invoke the exclusionary rule would not... would not be a purpose here to deter any police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.400" offset="12150727">And to suggest to this Court that it would deter police misconduct, I think is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.220" offset="12177999">Where they reasonably, under the circumstances... an objective test in a balancing... where they act based on the information before them, the Fourth Amendment should not be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.627" offset="12231602">It's not true that the police officers were not aware that she had property there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.281" offset="12250201">In the testimony of the police officer Entress, he said she told him that her items of personnel... personal property were still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.204" offset="12289907">And in terms of what counsel argues to you about the reverse of this case... that is, a privacy interest by Gail Fisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.143" offset="12321672">She would have a privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.012" offset="12329196">You don't have just have one place, one premise, one piece of property that you an invoke a privacy interest in and therefore seek the protection of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.617" offset="12367543">It is very possible that... in fact, I believe it's true that Gail Fisher would have had a privacy interest in that apartment on California Avenue to have sought the protection of the Fourth Amendment, just as she would perhaps in the apartment that she was staying in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.246" offset="12438074">She was... there was testimony she at that apartment every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.298" offset="12454270">She stayed there a few nights, but she was there every single day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.435" offset="12474854">If there was anybody that was excluded from that apartment during the time period, it was her children, not her.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.589" offset="12495439">So her privacy interest was still there, and if she had a privacy interest there, then certainly under the cases that this Court have found, she would have the ability to give consent or at least, in terms of the police conduct, for them to rely on her permission, her consent to allow the entry for the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.621" offset="12591570">This isn't a case about drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.371" offset="12594600">This is a case about the police acting immediately to arrest a person who committed a brutal, aggravated battery, and what was found incident to that lawful entry should not be suppressed.</text>
