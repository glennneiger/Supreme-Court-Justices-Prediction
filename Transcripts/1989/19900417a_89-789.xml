            <text syncTime="1582.363" offset="6467799">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.184" offset="6487130">The core issue in this case is to what degree may a police officer rely upon an anonymous tip informing reasonable, articulable suspicion necessary to justify a Terry stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.745" offset="6561317">We respectfully suggest that in the... facts in this case did not rise to that level of articulable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.834" offset="6597680">And the reason is that the reasonable suspicion requires more than minimal corroboration of innocent details.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.107" offset="6634774">There were at least four spots in this factual scenario where the police officers probably could have gotten that reasonable suspicion but did not for various reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.466" offset="6688272">A reference to our brief at page 33 and 34, I set forth or seek to set forth 12 deficiencies in this... in these facts that fail to meet the reasonable articulable suspicion required for a Terry-type stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.213" offset="6779283">And in this case we began with the premise that the officers knew nothing about their informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.486" offset="6816377">During the suppression hearing Officer Davis candidly admitted that he had no facts to determine the credibility, the believability, the veracity of his informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.828" offset="6869667">And secondly, he had no facts upon which he, as an officer, could rely upon in determining whether there was a factual basis for his knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.815" offset="7097663">In this case, I think the key element that's missing, Judge... Justice... is the fact that we do not have any description as a threshold matter of Vanessa White.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.502" offset="8548400">But in that case, they described the gentleman who would be leaving the train, Draper, coming back to Denver from Chicago, as being a black male, five, eight, 160, wearing brown pants, black shoes, carrying a tan briefcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.780" offset="8613497">Now, the visual observation then of the officer who saw a person fitting that exact description, coupled with the further detail that that person, Draper, would be moving at a rapid pace, brisk walk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.342" offset="8683714">And, indeed, the person fitting that description, with that walk, did get off the train from Chicago in the... the Denver terminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.400" offset="11088024">But I think that this Court has in Adams v. Williams case at least expressed some concern about anonymity without accountability, because the Chief Justice in answering those questions points out in the four factors that he gives at least twice the fact that the informant was known, had provided information in the past and, most critically, would have been subject to criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.489" offset="11228354">I do beg to differ from my co-counsel in that in this case, this informant would not have been subject to criminal prosecution because the officer said he did not know who that person was, and they had not heard from that individual subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.183" offset="11291152">And that the informant was not "known" to the Montgomery Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.693" offset="11345174">The linchpin of this case is whether or not the Court will approve a stop and a detention of a citizen based upon an information provided by an anonymous tipster who is not held to a standard of accountability and where the corroboration of the details is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.291" offset="11435557">In this case, as pointed out by Justice O'Connor, had they allowed the vehicle to get and even turn into the motel, if the officer had approached and said, my name is Patrolman David Byrne, may I see your license, please, ma'am, and that license turned out to be Vanessa White and she had made the turn into the Doby Motel at a minimum, I believe, given all of the facts under these circumstances, you would have had reasonably articulable suspicion.</text>
