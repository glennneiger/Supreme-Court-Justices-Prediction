            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="13.158" offset="196887">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.110" offset="212665">The facts of the issue of this case may be simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.263" offset="233354">On July 20, 1979, four days after the end of an economic strike, the employer withdrew recognition from the duly certified union.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.237" offset="285181">At that time, the bargaining unit consisted of 49 employees; 25 of these employees were permanent replacements who had been hired by the employer during the economic strike, and who had crossed the picket line to get to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.968" offset="360100">The National Labor Relations Board said that that fact, coupled with certain other facts... i.e., the record... did not suffice to create an objective basis to establish a good faith doubt on the employer's part that the union still enjoyed majority support.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.881" offset="439826">Therefore, the withdrawal of recognition was an unfair labor practice, a failure to bargain in good faith under Section 8(a)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="83.070" offset="476607">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied enforcement of this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.558" offset="498549">The key to the court of appeals opinion was its determination that the Board was required to adopt the so-called Gorman presumption, that it was compelled to infer that the permanent replacements who had been hired during the strike would not... did not and would not support the union, that therefore there was a sufficient objective basis to support the employer's withdrawal of recognition.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.743" offset="619235">Mr. Shapiro, do you think that the Board could have given any evidentiary value to the fact that it was replacement workers who were working?</text>
            <text syncTime="133.670" offset="679003">Maybe not required to.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.253" offset="685273">Do you think the Board could give some evidentiary weight to that fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="145.227" offset="725188">One is that the Board does not exclude that evidence as irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.131" offset="748802">It is part of the situation on which the Board makes its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.166" offset="764894">And there are indeed cases where that factor along with other significant factors have counted.</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="178.032" offset="856427">--Well, there is, at the moment, I think, an ongoing dialogue between the Board and the courts of appeals on exactly what is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.804" offset="899477">Two significant cases during the 1980s were the IT Services case and the Stormer case in the Board, in which there had been significant number of permanent replacements hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.712" offset="947124">Some of those replacements had individually expressed opposition to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.997" offset="968231">There had been a significant amount of violence on the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.865" offset="983696">There had been insistent union demands that the replacements be themselves fired and that the strikers be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.555" offset="1018491">There... those were situations in which the Board held that a good faith doubt had been established.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="228.260" stopTime="281.193">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="228.260" offset="1057361">Mr. Shapiro, I can under... it is the Board's rule that a good faith doubt suffices.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.414" offset="1085887">Now, I can understand the Board saying we no longer want that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.716" offset="1103127">But the Board has adhered to that rule, that a good faith doubt suffices.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.703" offset="1123085">That is a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.870" offset="1127787">But I don't see how whether or not a good faith doubt reasonably must be thought to exist is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.876" offset="1155790">I mean, it's a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.526" offset="1162373">I find it difficult to believe that when you have a union striking, demanding that their people be brought back and that the scabs, which they refer to them as, that the employer has hired, be dismissed, it seems... how can you possibly say that the employer doesn't have a good faith doubt whether these scabs want to join the union?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.841" offset="1251607">It boggles the mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.991" offset="1256205">If you want to abolish the good faith doubt rule, that is one thing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="281.193" stopTime="334.946">
            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="281.193" offset="1269057">Your Honor, I think I would like to do two things in response to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.797" offset="1291418">First of all, to note that it is not always true that unions are demanding right up to the point that recognition be withdrawn, that the replacements themselves be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.940" offset="1348051">I... indeed of the Dold case, which is one of the cases recently decided by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.944" offset="1368009">At the time the employer withdrew recognition from the union, the union had acknowledged that, I think, something like 170 of the 200 replacements were entitled to the jobs, were not to be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.084" offset="1420567">So that situation varies from case to case.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.603" offset="1430703">In this case there is no record whatever of a union demand that the replacements be fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.340" offset="1457661">There was simply an offer to return to work, an unconditional offer to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.244" offset="1477305">But I think there is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="334.946" stopTime="336.746">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="334.946" offset="1484097">They wanted their members rehired, didn't they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="336.746" stopTime="337.898">
            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="336.746" offset="1491307">--I think they would have liked that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="337.898" stopTime="342.350">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="337.898" offset="1495905">Well, it's very hard to get your members rehired if the people that have been brought in to replace them are not told to leave.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="342.350" stopTime="374.505">
            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="342.350" offset="1513668">Well, in many situations, as Judge Williams pointed out in the dissent below, the accommodation that is reached is for the employer to take back many or most of the strikers, although some have been gone... may have gone on to other jobs, to take back many or most of the strikers, but to retain many or most of the replacements, and then to rely on a process of attrition, if the business is not expanding, to bring the work complement back to what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.584" offset="1622651">Those situations do vary from case to case and from strike to strike.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="374.505" stopTime="394.649">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="374.505" offset="1642295">Not very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.857" offset="1647728">In fact, the Board itself has said, hasn't it, that "strike replacements" can reasonably foresee that if the union is successful the strikers will return to work and the strike replacements will be out of a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.396" offset="1693913">Isn't that the... you're talking about the existence of a reasonable doubt on the part of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.948" offset="1712094">This involves probabilities, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_l_shapiro" startTime="394.649" stopTime="555.537">
            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="394.649" offset="1722856">Your Honor, I don't... but the question here, I think, is not whether a Board decision to adopt a presumption of this kind is correct and entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.905" offset="1763921">The question is whether the Board's decision, for both reasons of policy and what it regards as industrial realities, that, to regard such a presumption as required, is reasonable and entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.581" offset="1818569">I think perhaps it is the... the good faith doubt test is absolutely critical, I think, to an understanding of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.687" offset="1851065">I think it is important to understand what the nature of that good faith doubt test is and how it originated.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.376" offset="1889831">The act itself imposes an obligation on employers to recognize a duly certified union that has won an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.434" offset="1930060">The act makes it clear that that obligation ceases if there is a decertification election, at which time the union loses its majority support.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.175" offset="1985021">The act, however, says nothing about whether there are circumstances in which an employer may lawfully and unilaterally, without an election, withdraw recognition from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.335" offset="2037580">So the Board, over a period of some 50 years, has considered the question whether there are circumstances in which an employer may lawfully, unilaterally, without an election, withdraw recognition from a duly certified union.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.213" offset="2109155">The Board has said that there are such circumstances, but that in the interests of industrial peace, continuity of labor relations and stability, an employer may not do so if the union, the employer and the bargaining unit still exist, may not do so during the first year after certification, may not do so during the normal term of a collective bargaining agreement, and may not do so at other times, unless the employer may... can establish, as a matter of fact, that the union has lost its majority or that there is a sufficient objective basis for a good faith doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.175" offset="2288982">Now, that last rule is sometimes referred to as the rebuttable presumption of continuing majority support.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.098" offset="2328688">That has been in existence for over 50 years, and which the courts, the lower courts and this Court, have unanimously endorsed.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.537" offset="2366409">Well, it couldn't have existed for 50 years, if the Board's old rule used to be that if the bargaining unit now contains a majority of replacements, that that establishes a good faith doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.407" offset="4157887">That may well be, but that's an evolution of its perception as to what the law should be, not an evolution of its perception as to what the facts are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.109" offset="4488701">And in the course of that development the Board articulated, in cases like Pennco back in 1980 and KKHI more recently, both empirical and policy grounds for refusing to draw the inference on the basis of the hiring of permanent replacements alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.987" offset="4564247">The Board had seen a variety of situations in which permanent replacements were hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.308" offset="4585459">Some of them, like IT Services and Stormer, involved considerable violence, involved significant union demands for firing of the replacements, involved other factors that indicated strongly to the Board that a good faith doubt had been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.119" offset="4664767">Cases, however, arose in which there were no other facts at all, in which, in some of those cases, the replacements themselves were union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.910" offset="4703950">In which, as in this case, there was very little activity on the picket line, which dwindled practically to nothing, in which the employer withdrew recognition not during the period of the strike, but four days after the strike was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.604" offset="4770719">In which union demands, if they were made at all for firing the replacements, were made only in terms of an offer of the strikers to return to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.183" offset="6821018">Perhaps the most glaring defect in the Board's Station KKHI rule is its failure to come to grips with the evidence in this case that Curtin Matheson hired a new work force of permanent replacement employees who never, by word or deed, have expressed any interest whatsoever in the incumbent union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.562" offset="6890504">This, coupled with the inherent conflict, which the Board has recognized for decades to exist in this situation, condemns as irrational the Board's position in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.117" offset="10284750">In other words, the new union would have its loyalties to the replacement employees, not to the strikers, which is certainly most probable as to those two choices, or to choose to remain union free, which is the choice guaranteed to the majority under Section 7 of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.257" offset="12221260">And further, the Board compounds its error when it, at page 75a of the joint appendix... excuse me, the Petitioner's appendix, the Board offers its policy support for the rule, and it says that to accept the Gorman presumption would disrupt the balance of competing economic weapons long established in strike situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.837" offset="12299627">That's simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.303" offset="12305478">The balance of competing economic weapons has been struck, or was struck, for 25 years, precisely the way the Fifth Circuit struck it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.223" offset="12337139">I believe, for these reasons alone, that is the Board's denial of its 25 year history of operating under the rule and its positioning or supporting its policy grounds on the idea that to accept the Gorman presumption would disrupt the balance of competing economic weapons long established, for these reasons alone it would be virtually impossible to find the Board's decision in KKHI was rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.813" offset="12479558">The Board's explanation that an employer may stonewall negotiations and hire replacements and, in effect, kick the union out by this vehicle, is also not supported by any findings or... in fact that is post hoc rationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.990" offset="12540267">The Board, in Station KKHI, made no reference to those possibilities, and certainly brought to the court's attention no examples of that kind of problem in the 25 years when the presumption of continuing majority held sway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.232" offset="12593243">But moreover, in our case there certainly were no allegations of any such misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.302" offset="12617485">And the Board has ample remedial authority in the act to deal with any situations of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.456" offset="12642145">Section 8(a)(5) requires good-faith bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.158" offset="12652907">Section 8(d) defines good-faith bargaining to include meeting at reasonable times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.294" offset="12673491">You can't stonewall negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.829" offset="12683627">There are concepts in the Labor Act as found by the Board which prevent so-called circus bargaining, where the employers engage in bargaining which is not designed to reach agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.518" offset="12722393">All of these provisions of the act can come into play to prevent an employer from doing what the Board says could occur if the Gorman presumption is credited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.194" offset="12773070">But probably the most... one of the most devastating points which undercuts the Board's Station KKHI rule is its inconsistency with not only this inherent conflict which exists between strike replacements and the incumbent union, but the Board's position in the Service Electric line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.425" offset="12853945">In that line of cases, we cite this line in our brief, as does the Chamber, the Chamber devotes an entire section to this particular argument, under Service Electric, because of this inherent conflict, the Board has ruled that the union cannot represent the replacement employees during the strike, because it has a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.636" offset="12930850">It would like to get them fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.004" offset="12936283">In fact, it is the union's goal, the Board reasons, to get them fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.540" offset="12954465">And because of this inherent conflict the Board cannot represent the replacement interest, replacement employees during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.479" offset="12986229">And yet, the Board would suggest that the replacement employees want this union to represent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.348" offset="13005665">Fatally inconsistent positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.083" offset="13012561">And the Board offers no explanation to reconcile these divergent views.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.387" offset="13033877">And because of that failure to reconcile its position in the Service Electric line of cases with its position in Station KKHI, this Court does not owe deference to the Board's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.261" offset="13077345">Likewise, the Fansteel line of cases, which is a case from this Court in 1938, and the Board argues that because it is so old it doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.867" offset="13119767">But the Board itself has applied that case all the way down through the '70s in the Beacon Upholstery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.687" offset="13143069">In these cases, the Board holds that it is proper for an employer to withdraw recognition when he hires permanent replacements for strikers who have been lawfully discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.329" offset="13189567">And one wonders what the... what conceivable difference it could make if the... if the strikers on the one hand are discharged and the replacements are brought in for them, or whether the strikers are on strike awaiting reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.386" offset="13241811">Indeed, I suggest that because the replacements are on... excuse me, the strikers are on strike and awaiting reinstatement, there is far more reason to believe that, from the replacement standpoint, they are more concerned about having the incumbent union bring these people back than they would be in the case where the strikers have been lawfully discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.383" offset="13321851">And, again, the Board offers no explanation for these inconsistent results in its Station KKHI decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.239" offset="13349227">And for these reasons, again, the Board's decision is entitled to no deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.059" offset="13372528">But it's primary policy ground, that is, the doomsday scenario that it posits, that once the employer hires a sufficient number of replacements to outnumber the strikers and cross-overs, the employer may withdraw recognition and therefore disrupt bargaining stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.771" offset="13443372">That argument overstates the proposition, because all the union needs to do is elect... rather than file an unfair labor practice charge and become mired in years of litigation, all it has to do is file its petition for an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.412" offset="13501887">The Board, the union only needs 30 percent support in which to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.066" offset="13520590">I am sure the Board could very promptly convene an election, determine the question whether the replacement employees want the union, and if they do, then the bargaining obligation attaches and, indeed, the union has one year of protection, because of the one year certification rule which we heard discussed here today, within which to operate without fear of loss of majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.098" offset="13608675">There simply is no terminal point to bargaining as a consequence of an employer raising a good faith doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.435" offset="13638037">And we believe that the Board's statements to the Court to the contrary are unfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.950" offset="13728107">If the Court has no further questions, I relinquish the balance of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="3405.556" offset="13766455">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.289" offset="13773456">One point I think is very important to stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.710" offset="13791114">That the question in this case is not whether the Board must consider as relevant the hiring of replacements during an economic strike, nor is it the question of how much probative weight that fact may be entitled to, along with other facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.540" offset="13874393">Those questions are the subject of an ongoing dialogue now between the Board and the courts of appeals in cases like Manville and Bickerstaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.848" offset="13915666">The question in this case is much narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.550" offset="13930504">The question in this case is whether a court may properly require the Board to adopt the Gorman presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.156" offset="13964881">The question whether the Board is required to infer that a permanent replacement hired during an economic strike is by virtue of that fact alone opposed to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.230" offset="14021201">Therefore, if 50 percent or more of the employees in a unit meet that category--</text>

            <text syncTime="3476.384" offset="14049831">So, Mr. Shapiro, if the Board excludes a lot of what would otherwise be normal ways of proving a fact, to refuse to adopt a presumption can be much more important than if there were lots of other ways of proving facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.743" offset="14115242">--Your Honor, the Board has adhered to the good faith test, although I think, as several members of the Court have suggested, it may not have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.682" offset="14147007">But it has adhered to that test in the light of a rigorous standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.586" offset="14170621">It does accept objective circumstantial evidence of non support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.240" offset="14197266">It does not insist on a head count of employees showing that 50 percent or more are opposed to the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.365" offset="14237704">Mr. Shapiro, the question is not whether in fact these employees support the union or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.320" offset="14269573">That is not the question under the Board's law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.153" offset="14276887">The question under the Board's law is whether the employer in fact has a reasonable belief that they do not support the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.909" offset="14307921">That is a quite different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.759" offset="14315340">And whether you can use it as a presumption for the one is quite different as to whether it necessarily indicates the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.181" offset="14348985">It is very hard to say that an employer who replaces a striking force does not have a reasonable belief that the replacement people don't want to be in the union, that particular one.</text>
