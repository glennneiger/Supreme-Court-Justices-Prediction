            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="87127">And the second case is Blystone against Pennsylvania, and the petitioner in this case was convicted of robbery and first degree murder by a Pennsylvania jury and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.291" offset="136237">The Pennsylvania death penalty statute provides that in such cases a sentence of death must be imposed if a jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.798" offset="190258">The jury in this case found one aggravating factor, that the killing was committed during the course of a felony, but found no mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.364" offset="224531">It accordingly sentenced the petitioner to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.600" offset="237488">On appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, this conviction and sentence was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.446" offset="260894">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.200" offset="267894">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that the Pennsylvania death penalty statute in petitionerâ€™s sentence under it is consistent with our decisions in interpreting the Eight Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.920" offset="318781">We have previously decided that state laws which impose the death penalty solely because of a particular crime committed, for example, murder committed by an inmate serving a life sentence are invalid because they do not allow for any consideration of the particular circumstances of the offense or of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.692" offset="405821">Petitioner claims that the Pennsylvania statute is similarly mandatory in character because if the jury finds aggravating circumstances but no mitigating circumstances, it must impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.169" offset="455767">We reject this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.337" offset="464440">Pennsylvania allows the jury to consider both aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances regarding the nature of the offense in the character of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.808" offset="502265">The Eight Amendment imposes no further requirement that the jury be left totally free to find in favor of a life sentence even though it found aggravating circumstances but no mitigating ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.034" offset="543225">So, we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.608" offset="557540">Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Marshall has joined and in which Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens have joined except for part 4.</text>
