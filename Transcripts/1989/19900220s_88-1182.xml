            <text syncTime="10.585" offset="129471">These cases come to this Court on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.818" offset="154340">They concern the State’s efforts to protect the petitioner, Maurice M., a young child with a sad history of abuse and neglect, by seeking to have the respondent, Maurice’s mother, produce the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.198" offset="223930">The respondent, entrusted with Maurice’s care subject to the conditions of a court order, asserted that the Fifth Amendment entitled her to resist the production order.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.011" offset="275130">The Court of Appeals of Maryland agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.319" offset="288400">In the opinion filed today, we hold that respondent may not invoke the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against self-incrimination to resist producing Maurice.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.081" offset="339391">The State demands production as part of a generally applicable regulatory regime constructed to affect the State’s public purposes which are unrelated to criminal law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.885" offset="390591">The respondent, by agreeing to care for the child pursuant to the order’s conditions, has accepted the corresponding obligation to permit the State access to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.486" offset="441060">We leave open the possibility that the Fifth Amendment may limit the State’s use and subsequent criminal proceedings, if any, of testimonial aspects of any act of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.834" offset="490484">The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is reversed and the cases are remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.723" offset="529981">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
