            <text syncTime="17.103" offset="209589">The question in this case is whether a Federal agency can be required to bargain over a union proposal that would subject certain agency decisions with respect to the contracting out of agency work to the grievance procedure of the collective bargaining agreement and to third-party arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.747" offset="300182">The agency position, that is, the position of the Internal Revenue Service in this case, has been that it cannot be required to bargain over this proposal, that indeed, bargaining over the proposal is precluded by the management rights provision of the Federal Labor Management Relations statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.411" offset="382833">The union proposal in this case is related to Circular A-76, issued by the Office of Management and Budget, which is an arm of the Executive Office of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.022" offset="441243">Circular A-76 was originally issued in the early... in the 1950s and has been amended a number of times ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.418" offset="482830">It is a statement of executive policy on the important matter of Federal procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.533" offset="515326">It deals in some detail with the circumstances under which the particular work shall be done inside the agency or shall be contracted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.651" offset="571855">The Circular specifically states not only that it is designed to give administrative direction to heads of agencies, but, and I quote, that it</text>
            <text syncTime="119.111" offset="617622">"shall not establish and shall not be construed to create any substantive or procedural basis for anyone to challenge any agency action or inaction on the basis that it was not in accordance with the Circular, except as specifically provided in the Circular itself.

            <text syncTime="172.118" offset="829632">So that if Circular A-76 did confer third-party rights that would be enforceable in court, then that threshold aspect of our argument would be crossed, and you would come to the latter part of our argument that the subject matter of the Circular is excluded from bargaining by Section 7117--</text>

            <text syncTime="239.844" offset="1100574">We do believe, however, that there is a considerable difference between the scope, purpose and language of 7117 on the one hand and the scope and language of 7106 on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.633" offset="1203705">There are three relevant provisions of this statute, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.187" offset="1229932">There is the definition of a grievance, in Section 7103, which refers very broadly to any complaint of any violation of a law, rule or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.338" offset="1286566">There is Section 7117, which excludes from the scope of bargaining any proposal that is inconsistent with any governmentwide rule or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.487" offset="1343199">Now, it may be that the concept of a rule in those two provisions is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.024" offset="1373292">We content in our brief that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.584" offset="1383532">But it may be that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.497" offset="1391160">Congress has indicated in the legislative history that it regards a government policy statement as within the scope of 7117.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.376" offset="1434732">But the third provision of the act, and the one in which we place our central reliance, is the management rights provision of 7106.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.450" offset="2654964">7117, they say, only operates to preclude certain matters from negotiation, but not from the operation of the grievance procedure or the arbitration provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.019" offset="2741273">That's right, and indeed that is their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.841" offset="2752557">Their argument here is that the union proposal is superfluous, that the authority to go to the grievance procedure and arbitration would exist even without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.468" offset="2791114">In fact, the FLRA's position here is that this case essentially is resolved by the definition of a grievance in Section 7103.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.167" offset="2841896">They say that because the concept of a grievance has such a broad definition, any matter relating to subcontracting, in effect, can be taken to arbitration without regard to the management rights provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.999" offset="2913158">Indeed, as I read their argument, they are saying that the definition of a grievance overrides the management rights provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.975" offset="2953073">That the management rights provision, they say, comes into play only insofar as it may exercise a constraint on the arbitrator's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.812" offset="2996437">That the arbitrator may not substitute his judgment for that of a Federal agency in matters of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.158" offset="3033844">Now, on this score, that is, reading the grievance procedure in effect to override the threshold provisions of the management rights provision, there is a very fundamental disagreement between the FLRA and the Federal agency employer in this case that goes to the heart of the construction and purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.614" offset="3127676">We believe the FLRA is incorrect for two essential reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.869" offset="3148678">First of all, the definition of a grievance is very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.660" offset="3163829">It covers not only any complaint involving the violation of a rule or regulation, but also, as the union quite happily points out, covers any complaint involving any matter relating to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.153" offset="3229762">So that if the definition of a grievance overrode the management rights provision, it would be not only that any complaint of violation of Circular A-76 could be taken to arbitration, but any complaint about subcontracting, even if there were no Circular A-76, because, as we concede, a complaint about subcontracting is a complaint about a matter relating to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.242" offset="3350135">We do not believe that the grievance definition can override the management rights provision in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.245" offset="3378138">Indeed, the management rights provision itself makes it clear that that cannot be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.809" offset="3400394">The management rights provision, Section 7106, which is an essential part of this statute in terms of the very special needs of the government, states that subject to Subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter, and that includes the definition of a grievance, nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency in accordance with applicable law to make determinations with respect to contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.792" offset="3536335">Now, in our view, that means that determinations with respect to contracting out, which is what we have in this case, can be subject to the act despite the management rights provision only in two circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.774" offset="3604254">One is if it falls within Subsection (b) of the management rights provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="941.077" offset="3905498">But we contend, in accordance with every lower court judge who has discussed this issue, that Circular A-76 is not an applicable law within the meaning of the management rights provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.218" offset="3966102">And we contend that for several reasons, which we think are evident from the face of the document itself, from its source, from its purpose and from its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.437" offset="4018974">To begin with, as I indicated earlier, the document itself makes it clear that it is intended as a directive from a superior to a subordinate for the guidance of that subordinate, and that it is not designed to create any third-party rights or enforceable duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.194" offset="4113955">It says specifically that it shall not be construed to create any basis for anyone to challenge any agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.021" offset="4153243">Now, it is not simply the evident purpose of the document that we believe leads to that conclusion, it is the nature of the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.306" offset="4186471">It is the fact that the document is issued as a policy directive on a matter of procurement policy by a branch of the Executive Office of the President, which is the President's principal arm for the exercise of his managerial functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.670" offset="4255852">It is a document that necessarily contains in it a great deal of delegated discretion, that is... is essential for the effective operation of this document that agency heads bring their expert judgment to bear on these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.121" offset="4333697">And it is a document which it's clear purpose and effect is designed essentially as any order from a superior to a subordinate would be designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.431" offset="4390957">It is, in other words, in our view, the exercise of the very kind of managerial prerogative that Section 7106 is designed to preserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.275" offset="7374350">The grievance procedure is something under the Circular that has afforded directly affected parties to challenge compliance with what the Circular would appear to concede are mandatory and non-discretionary aspects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.863" offset="7512695">This would appear to be a law, rule or regulation affecting conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.086" offset="7529517">I would like to emphasize one important point that is being raised by IRS, latter in the case, is a suspicion about the intent behind the grievance procedure, that because it is in a definitional provision of the statute it perhaps is an inadvertent or unintended reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.549" offset="7603392">The legislative history of the statute shows the Congress was very well aware that it was defining the scope of the grievance procedure by use of this definitional provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.385" offset="7686775">And, if you'll notice in Section 7121(c), a small portion of management rights do appear there, so that management didn't think that just by making something a management... I am sorry, so that Congress didn't think that just by making something a management right it also made it non-grievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.624" offset="7747692">The conference committee report also stated that unless the parties agree otherwise, and obviously IRS is perfectly well equipped to do so, to bargain at the table for a narrower scope, the intended scope of the grievance procedure was a broad one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.406" offset="7810804">The suggestion that the grievance definition is not to be trusted, I believe underlies a basic unfamiliarity that IRS has with this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.533" offset="7843300">The other cornerstone is the collective bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.625" offset="7855735">In Section 7114 of the statute just says under our law have a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.939" offset="7880917">One has to go to three separate definitional provisions, collective bargaining agreement and then collective bargaining and then conditions of employment, before the contours of that bargaining obligation even begin to surface.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.019" offset="10105295">No, we certainly could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.468" offset="10111042">Let me explain to you why... why we would want to make such a proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.471" offset="10127134">It is common practice in the Federal sector to incorporate important regulatory provisions right into the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.948" offset="10160989">That... that's just the way things are done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.321" offset="10170497">So much of the employment relationship in the Federal sector, after all, is determined by laws, rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.555" offset="10199441">The contracts are largely enforced and administered by lay people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.680" offset="10219921">It helps them to a great extent to have these very important laws, rules and regulations in the contract so that they can see what the relevant provisions are, so that they can be guided by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.267" offset="10266314">Furthermore, it helps employees because it puts the employer agency on notice that this is a rule... this is a regulation that you are going to have to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.914" offset="10304871">And we hope that it thereby encourages compliance with these kinds of rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.439" offset="10326918">And furthermore, as my friend with the FLRA has already pointed out, it helps avoid future disputes about whether something is arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.665" offset="10359833">So there are very sound practical reasons why we would make such a proposal, and indeed it is every day practice in the Federal sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.769" offset="10392329">Next, let me address the IRS' contention that the applicable laws language in 7106 should be read to have a narrower scope than laws, rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.189" offset="10445932">We have heard them concede today that the A-76 Circular is indeed a rule within the meaning of the grievance procedure, but they say that is not good enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.335" offset="10482504">They suggest that we have to show something more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.037" offset="10493371">And we would submit that that is untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.301" offset="10502357">There are many rules, many rules in the Federal sector, for example those in the Federal Personnel Manual, that have always been routinely grievable, but under the IRS' construction of the statute, they would read applicable laws to cancel out the express statutory right to file grievances over those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.853" offset="10584590">To put it a somewhat different way, under the IRS' construction of the statute, and we believe it is a rather strange one, it would mean that the agency actually has a right to violate rules and regulations that do not meet its definition of applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.915" offset="10648851">And we would say that that is an untenable... an untenable view of the statute, indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.517" offset="10667242">Finally, let me add that even if the government, the IRS, were somehow correct here, that we had to demonstrate that the Circular was a regulation with the force of law, that is, a substantive rule or a legislative rule, and we would emphasize that we do not believe that that is our burden here, but even if that were correct we would strongly suggest that we meet even that most stringent test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.257" offset="10774239">And let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.826" offset="10780509">First of all, what we have here is a Circular that was issued pursuant to statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.221" offset="10806109">It is unquestionably binding on executive agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.855" offset="10824603">They gave notice, they asked for comment, they held hearings and, perhaps most important, they incorporated the provisions of A-76 right into the code of Federal regulations within the subpart that describes the Federal acquisition regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.007" offset="10897224">If that isn't a substantive rule or regulation, I suppose I am not sure what is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.451" offset="10914987">So, for these reasons we would say that by any stretch of the imagination the A-76 Circular is indeed a law, rule or regulation within the meaning of the grievance procedure, which we would submit controls here, or it is an applicable law even under the IRS' most stringent definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.512" offset="11795209">Just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.004" offset="11801269">First of all, if the FLRA's position in this case is correct, the union's bargaining proposal is not simply superfluous, it is far narrower than the actual matters that can be grieved and taken to arbitration, because it is not limited to matters covered by the internal appeals procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.750" offset="11888205">It would embrace all matters within the Circular, and indeed any decision with respect to subcontracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.113" offset="11913700">Second, we have been, I think, accused of making several concessions that we have never made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.998" offset="11945152">We do not concede that the term "applicable laws" is to be given the same meaning as the term "law, rule or regulation" elsewhere in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.597" offset="11995620">We believe that the FLRA's reading of the grievance definition is too broad, but we contend quite vigorously that, whatever the proper reading of that definition, the phrase applicable laws is considerably narrower in its purpose and scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.560" offset="12067405">Finally, I--</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.973" offset="12077122">I... that is what I really don't understand, Mr. Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.954" offset="12089034">What kind of rules and regulations are under applicable laws?</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="2993.769" offset="12116306">--Your Honor, if we start with the use of the phrase laws, rules or regulations in 7117, Congress indicated there that they regarded the phrase to be broad enough to include governmentwide policy directives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.301" offset="12186419">They did not want the parties bargaining in matters inconsistent with governmentwide policy directives on any subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.827" offset="12216512">But when they use the phrase applicable laws in 7106, we contend that they meant only statutes and regulations having the force of law in the sense that they conferred enforceable rights and duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.427" offset="12282863">We do not believe that phrase embraces policy statements of the kind involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.263" offset="12306269">Now, I think perhaps the critical difference between the IRS and the Authority here is with respect to the role the management rights provision plays.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.571" offset="12359454">As I understand the Authority's position, it is that all that the management rights provision does is to exercise constraint on arbitrators when they are deciding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.409" offset="12410863">They should not interfere with managerial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.411" offset="12426850">We contend that the management rights provision, when it is fully applicable, must go to the threshold question of grievability, arbitrability, as well as negotiability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.660" offset="12483797">That the management rights provision means that managerial decisions, whether they are discretionary or not, should not be turned over to a third-party decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.558" offset="12531444">And the... what happened in the Blytheville case, which is an example of the consequences of that kind of authorization, we believe strongly supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.655" offset="12579823">And indeed, Major Ketler, who discusses the Blytheville case in detail in the only study I know of this problem, agrees with us that there was in that case a significant arbitral interference which was upheld by the FLRA with the exercise of managerial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.920" offset="12656832">In other words, the key to this case for us is that the management rights provision, when it is fully applicable, as it is here because none of the exceptions in the provision apply, that provision excludes not only negotiability but grievability and arbitrability.</text>
