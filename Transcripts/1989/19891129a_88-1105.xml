            <text syncTime="9.988" offset="177820">Mr. Silverman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eldon E. Silverman</label>
            <text syncTime="14.753" offset="196837">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.074" offset="222124">In the district court Curtis Guidry stipulated that his former employer, the union, was entitled to a judgment in the amount of $275,000 because of theft by Mr. Guidry from his union employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.687" offset="288579">He, however, opposed any taking of this three separate pension funds based on the anti-alienation clause in the Employee Retirement Security Income Act of 1974, which is also known as ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.889" offset="361409">The distric' court imposed the constructive trust, indicating that it was creating only a narrow exception for Mr. Guidry and in favor of the union to redress the theft of union employer funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.718" offset="420759">The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, choosing between conflicting circuits, and chose to follow that line of cases that say that federal courts have inherent equitable common law powers to create exceptions to a congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.179" offset="494529">The Tenth Circuit also recognized on the alternative argument of Mr. Guidry that a constructive trust was a garnishment within the Consumer Credit Protection Act, which meant that he would be entitled to 75 percent as an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.590" offset="560253">However, the Tenth Circuit held Mr. Guidry failed to preserve that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.804" offset="581046">Today I will make three major arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.486" offset="595779">The first is that Congress created the anti-alienation clause in ERISA with its own three narrow exceptions, none of which are applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.134" offset="642382">Under separation of powers, it is Congress, not the courts, that should make any changes to ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.508" offset="671848">Second, the creation of a special exemption for the union based on federal labor law would effectively gut the anti-alienation clause because any other judgment creditor of a federal cause of action would also say that its judgment was claimed to be impaired by the anti-alienation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.954" offset="761709">Lastly, in the event that you find that the constructive trust was properly imposed, Mr. Guidry is entitled to at least 75 percent of his pension under the Consumer Credit Protection Act because a constructive trust clearly fits within the definition of garnishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.579" offset="916145">What I'm actually arguing is that he's entitled under the ERISA to 100 percent, so I'm arguing in the alternative that if you don't accept the first argument of 100, then he deserves 75 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.497" offset="967867">As to the first argument, after almost a decade of study, Congress passed ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.282" offset="994930">This Court has repeatedly called ERISA a comprehensive and reticulated statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.496" offset="1019799">In fact, it has six subtitles.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.518" offset="1031920">It has over 150 subsections, not... not counting other intricate sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.911" offset="1061490">Among one of the interrelated provisions is the anti-alienation clause in Section 1056(d), which is clear-cut and straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.920" offset="1105585">The concept of anti-alienation is not new to federal law in ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.922" offset="1125543">Strong anti-alienation causes have predated ERISA, such as in the Civil Service Retirement Act, the Social Security Act, the Railroad Retirement Act and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.601" offset="1176220">Congress has shown that it can create its own exceptions to ERISA by initially in the first act legislating two narrow exceptions and then in 1984 legislating a third, none of which are claimed to be applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.881" offset="1241422">In enacting an anti-alienation clause, Congress chose between competing social principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.476" offset="1267753">In enacting the clause, Congress decided that no matter how deserving a judgment creditor, how egregious an action of the judgment debtor was, that pension funds could not be touched.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.486" offset="1327835">This is not unusual either, because both state and federal legislatures historically have provided exemption laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.980" offset="1357823">Take the Homestead exemption which has been historical.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.772" offset="1372974">Take the Tools of the Trade exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.829" offset="1537128">That has been a misinterpreted fact, and we say the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.231" offset="1554787">In fact, the action... there were competing claims in the district court, and, in fact, Mr. Guidry was only fiduciary of one of the three plans, the Local 9 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.660" offset="1596478">He wasn't a fiduciary of the two national pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.382" offset="1611420">As to that one plan, there was a state court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.485" offset="1623750">He settled it before this instant case, and there was a release given to him, and the pension resumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.510" offset="1651858">So he basically upheld his anti-alienation rights in that state court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.704" offset="1676622">The union then started a separate action, brought in the pension funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.535" offset="1695952">They came in in different ways below.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.986" offset="1757810">It was raised by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.730" offset="1772752">He... when he went and said in pari materia to create a narrow exception, he did cite the LMRDA and said I think it's in pari materia.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.586" offset="1816220">And as we've argued, in pari materia means statutes of the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.551" offset="1836073">If you have to get to judicial construction, we would argue that the same subject matter of anti-alienation is anti-alienation, and those are found in the Civil Service and in other federal acts which have mandated exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.399" offset="1895423">So we think LMRDA talks about a substantive right perhaps, whereas there's another substantive right in ERISA; namely, an exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.715" offset="2060726">The second and the initial legislation was if you borrowed from the plan you could secure it with your benefits, and then in '84 Congress allowed the QDRO, Qualified Domestic Relations Order, to further the purpose of the Act so that divorced people, divorced spouses and children, were also included within the rights of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.701" offset="2148707">So they have... Congress has clearly thought about it, and this Court has cautioned in other cases of ERISA against assuming that Congress unintentionally omitted something.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.650" offset="2200429">That was in Massachusetts Mutual v. Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.892" offset="2213386">There was a caution of this Court to assume that there is an additional remedy within this very complex interrelated statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.910" offset="2325503">And, of course, the whole point of a pension fund is not only to provide for the pensioner but for the dependents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.818" offset="4677151">Well, the reason I didn't argue it strongly is because my principal argument is plain meaning, and I didn't need to go and say, but look at the Treasury regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.975" offset="4713722">That supports my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.194" offset="4718633">Perhaps I should have, but since I felt it was plain and we didn't really get that argument back at us... the argument we got back at us is we should have brought another lawsuit against you under the LMRDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.153" offset="4770460">We're not going to support the Tenth Circuit and you should lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.176" offset="4782581">I would point out the argument that under the saving clause, if you take it that the saving clause somehow impairs an LMRDA judgment under Section 501(b) that they never got, if you argue that, then you'd argue that a judgment under the Securities Exchange Act of '34, the Fair Labor Standards Act would also be impaired by the anti-alienation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.612" offset="4884249">You'd end up with any federal cause of action judgment creditor going right through the anti-alienation clause, which could not have been the intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.806" offset="4917059">As to the last argument, in the event the Court does uphold the constructive trust we have made the alternative argument that under the Consumer Credit Protection Act he is entitled to a 75 percent exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.649" offset="4984455">The union employer in its brief concedes as it does on the constructive trust theory that it's not seeking to uphold the rationale of the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.473" offset="5023743">That rationale was that Mr. Guidry failed to claim the exemption by filing an objection form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.329" offset="5051120">As the case was set up, they garnished before they got the constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.323" offset="5075152">The pensions denied they owed any sums because, as I had told you earlier, they wanted it forfeited, so they wrote zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.638" offset="5108380">Under Colorado law, you have to calculate 75 percent, the garnishee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.143" offset="5134398">Well, the garnishee, because it's mathematically impossible, did not calculate 75 percent of zero; therefore, Mr. Guidry did not have... it wasn't right for him to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.138" offset="5178388">The union's basic argument is, well, we need to go back to when... when it all happened in the beginning, and whatever they argue they can't get around the fact that their cause of action in the district court invoked the equity arm of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.790" offset="5240978">It said it was an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.100" offset="5250277">In their brief, they admit a constructive trust is an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.884" offset="5269399">And earnings under CCPA include pensions, and you have to give a 75 percent exemption at the very least in terms of use of the CCPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.042" offset="5322062">A decision against Mr. Guidry, though satisfying for the particular moment and this particular union, would not be a step forward for the vast number of American workers who participate in pension funds whether they're union members or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.386" offset="5399384">ERISA's anti-alienation clause protects not only workers but its often innocent spouses and dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.961" offset="5433657">Anti-alienation is a clear federal policy expressed not only in ERISA but in other acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.925" offset="11557595">And there have been a number of exceptions at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.917" offset="11573477">So the only place to look for these exceptions is not ERISA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.330" offset="11591136">In fact, before ERISA was amended to expressly authorize exceptions for domestic relations orders, the courts had already implied an exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.822" offset="11797190">But we are concerned about the fact that this kind of activity is documented in labor history, the very kind of activity that Mr. Guidry engaged in.</text>
