            <text syncTime="25.948" offset="240531">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="29.000" offset="252757">The issue presented here is whether a state can exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant who was personally served while present in the state if that defendant does not otherwise have sufficient contacts with the state to satisfy the minimum contacts test announced in International Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.029" offset="320884">The issue arises in the following context.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.731" offset="331646">The parties lived virtually all their married lives in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.699" offset="343558">The split up in 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.135" offset="353276">They had two children about ages 2 and 8 at the time, and they entered into a marital settlement agreement resolving everything in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.539" offset="378876">The wife then moved to California with the children, as planned, and husband filed for dissolution in New Jersey and asked the court to incorporate their marital settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.244" offset="417746">Before he served Mrs. Burnham with his petition, she filed an action in California for legal separation and filed him after he brought the children back from visiting with them to her home in Mill Valley, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.404" offset="470304">Mr. Burnham moved to quash service arguing that he did not have sufficient minimum contacts under Kulko, International Shoe and similar cases and that under this Court's decision in Shaffer v. Heitner the fact that he was served in California was no longer relevant at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.330" offset="534043">The trial court initially agreed with Mr. Burnham and granted his motion, in part holding that there were not sufficient minimum contacts and there was no personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.351" offset="570092">It reconsidered that order when Mrs. Burnham's attorney convinced it that the fact that he was served in the forum was sufficient and that notwithstanding what this Court held in Shaffer and the language in Shaffer, personal service is still sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.926" offset="628397">The court of appeal denied the petition for a writ in a decision which, again, said that Shaffer, the language in Shaffer, had not changed the traditional rule... it goes by the nickname of transient jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.151" offset="673328">It relied on cases such as the Supreme Court's case in Nevada, Cariaga which had said this Court has never directly held that transient jurisdiction is no good so we will apply it until we are instructed otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.060" offset="728917">We're here today to ask you to instruct the courts of this land otherwise, to give effect to what the Court said in Shaffer, that personal jurisdiction in all cases must be tested by the minimum contacts test.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.968" offset="780639">Now, it's important to keep in mind that although the doctrine is often called transient jurisdiction or sometimes, more colorfully, gotcha jurisdiction, what's really at issue is not whether the defendant is passing through momentarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.144" offset="837273">What's at issue is whether the fact of service on a defendant while he is in the forum is alone sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.150" offset="865276">The traditional view that it was founded on the notion that... what jurisdiction is all about, what personal jurisdiction is all about is whether the state has power over the defendant, physical power over the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.707" offset="919506">And it does, according to the traditional view, when a defendant is within its boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.361" offset="938210">That view was long criticized by the commentators and was rejected by this Court in International Shoe and then again in Shaffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.182" offset="965482">That power, physical power over the defendant is not fundamentally the basis for the exercise of state court jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.002" offset="4724711">In thinking about this matter over the lunch hour it occurred to me that I ought to say that we're really not asking this Court to do anything very radical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.692" offset="4763477">Although it's true that the doctrine of transient jurisdiction has been around for a long time, there has been an evolution in the law which has pointed in the direction of abolishing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.548" offset="4802869">In fact, in Shaffer at page 213 the Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.000" offset="4820737">"We therefore conclude that all assertions of state court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.654" offset="4847382">That's been quoted very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.522" offset="4854801">However, there's a footnote to that sentence which has not been quoted very often, and it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.891" offset="4872251">"It would not be fruitful for us to reexamine the facts of cases decided on the rationales of Pennoyer and Harris to determine whether jurisdiction might be sustained under the standards we adopt today. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.881" offset="4920211">"To the extent that prior decisions are inconsistent with this standard, they are overruled. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.868" offset="4944244">So, already in Shaffer the Court had recognized that the law was moving in the direction of being concerned with fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.891" offset="4980293">And I think if you look at the old rule coming out of Pennoyer, it perhaps was fair in 1877 to say that, since you can't get service on the defendant outside the jurisdiction, if you're lucky enough to catch him in the jurisdiction, well, you've gotten him and you've got jurisdiction over him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.618" offset="5059183">But after International Shoe liberalized the degree to which you could get jurisdiction over the defendant by service outside the forum, the rationale for saying that you can get jurisdiction over him by serving him in the forum was totally undercut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.528" offset="5114876">Therefore, if you abolish the doctrine of transient jurisdiction in this case, all you're doing is kind of completing a trio of cases that started with International Shoe, Shaffer and now this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.920" offset="5164404">Unless you do something to the doctrine of transient jurisdiction, we're stuck with cases like Grace v. MacArthur where you're served if you're flying over and have no contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.893" offset="5208290">You're stuck with cases where the defendant comes into the forum and just steps over the line and is served with a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.916" offset="5240368">You're stuck with cases where somebody is on the way to Hawaii and the plane lands in San Francisco airport and they're served and have no other contacts with San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.439" offset="5278507">None of those things would seem to comport with fundamental notions of fair play and substantial justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.073" offset="6108992">--And they have statutes which say they may exercise jurisdiction to the full extent permitted by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.743" offset="6143682">There's... there are two additional reasons why... coming back to Justice O'Connor's question earlier today... why I think the Court should not adopt the restatement view if the Court is willing to abolish the pure form of transient jurisdiction which makes everything turn on service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.223" offset="6217661">The first is that it would accomplish a shift in the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.508" offset="6230722">Traditionally it's the plaintiff... when the defendant objects to jurisdiction, it's the plaintiff that has the burden of establishing a basis for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.846" offset="6260084">This would put the burden on the defendant to disprove why... to prove why there should not be jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.000" offset="6284744">And that would be an incentive for plaintiffs to lure defendants to the state and to serve them, as happened in this case, in a way that would interfere with other interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.541" offset="6322882">And I think it would be better if there was one standard that is consistently applied in making the plaintiff establish jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.944" offset="6348482">Secondly, if you do the restatement view, the restatement says jurisdiction is served in the forum unless otherwise unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.265" offset="6377740">This Court would then have to begin a process of deciding numerous cases to define the parameters of what's reasonable and unreasonable under the restatement test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.137" offset="6413266">There's already a body of law from this Court under the minimum contacts test defining what's reasonable and unreasonable, and it would be much simpler for everybody if that body of law was just engrafted on to all assertions of state court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.297" offset="6469900">Finally, I close my opening comments this afternoon by saying that if the Court determines that the rule has been around so long that we should keep it even though it may have unfair results, it shouldn't be applied in a case where somebody is served in the state while they're visiting their children, which is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.877" offset="6548267">And the reason for that is fundamentally that in Asahi this Court... and in World-Wide Volkswagen this Court made clear that one of the things to be considered in determining whether or not a state is exercising jurisdiction consistent with the Constitution is the degree to which it impacts upon the shared substance and policies of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.089" offset="6621096">I don't think it's beyond question that the share and substantive policy of the states in the area of child custody visitation is to encourage families of divorce to maintain contact between parents and the children after the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.515" offset="6678775">That policy will be impacted adversely by allowing transient jurisdiction in a case where somebody is served while they're visiting their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.871" offset="6712211">Therefore, if the Court does not totally abolish the rule and if the Court does not accept the restatement formulation, or even if it does, one of the things that it should say, it's unreasonable to allow jurisdiction to be predicated upon service on somebody who is in the state when they're seeing their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.214" offset="6777622">I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal, if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.105" offset="6825165">In the opinions issued by this Court over the last 45 years, starting with International Shoe, there has been a clear trend toward relaxing limits on state court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.846" offset="6876156">As Justice White observed in his opinion in World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson, this relaxation is largely attributable to the fundamental transformation of American society that has taken place and which has been accelerated in the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.124" offset="6941253">It is ironic that in this case, today as we stand on the threshold of the 21st century at a time when technological progress in travel and communication has resulted in a shrinking of our planet to the size of a global village, and at a time when the citizens of this country, more than at any other time in our history, are more likely to travel across state borders with ease and with increasing frequency, the petitioner is arguing for a retraction of the permissible reach of state jurisdiction and a categorical rule that presence within the boundaries of a... of the forum state should no longer provide the basis for the exercise of state jurisdiction under any circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.381" offset="8662200">It is true that there is an alternative basis, if the Court chooses not to do that, to uphold this decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.356" offset="8706190">I think it's important to point out that state courts always have the right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.477" offset="8738582">And in fact, probably the most relevant case where that occurred was Kulko, where in fact the California courts did decline to exercise jurisdiction and this Court upheld that judgment on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.304" offset="8793962">In this case and in Kulko, of course you did not have the actual presence of the defendant, and that is a major distinguishing factor between the facts of this case and the facts of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.112" offset="8841191">But there are additional important differences as well between this case and the facts in Kulko.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.015" offset="8864806">And perhaps the most important of those are the fact that here both California and New Jersey have carefully considered the propriety of those respective states assuming jurisdiction in this matter not only on the superior court level but on every level of the state judicial system in both states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.196" offset="8957488">And there is no conflict between the decisions of those two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.666" offset="8975356">They both came to consistent conclusions that California is an appropriate state to assume jurisdiction in this case under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.474" offset="9018615">In addition to that, and in addition to the fact that the husband was not physically present within California in Kulko, here you have more substantial contacts, more substantial connection between the defendant/husband and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.185" offset="9093429">And on that basis, I think that the exercise of jurisdiction is eminently reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.089" offset="9113073">In addition to all of those factors, here you have California being the state of domicile of the wife and the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.695" offset="9155496">I think that the decisions issued by this Court in recent years, starting with Kulko and continuing with World-Wide Volkswagen and Burger King and Keeton and Asahi Metal Industries, may reveal a shift in the analytical approach that the Court is taking toward the question of fairness and substantial justice, a shift in favor of evaluating the various interests and the other factors that are involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.416" offset="9282347">And particularly in a family law case, the fact of domicile of one of the spouses and the children, the interests of the state of domicile in the litigation in the subject matter of the case is an extremely important factor to be taken into consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.177" offset="9449426">Now, you are inviting us to decide it not on... this case not on this ground, but to decide whether in the particular facts and circumstances of this particular controversy there was enough contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.801" offset="9495924">Frankly, that's not an issue that's of sufficient national importance to have... to have warranted the attention that this Court has given to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.644" offset="9555274">Well, Justice Scalia, I, of course, can't speak to the reasons for the Court's granting cert. in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.916" offset="9584427">That is an important issue and I am not trying to persuade the Court to avoid deciding that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.468" offset="9606579">I believe that the Court should uphold the decision on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.455" offset="9626536">But what I am suggesting is that this case also provides an opportunity, should the Court desire to take the opportunity, to decide the case on alternative grounds as well, one of which is the question of sufficient connection or contacts, another of which is an evaluation of California's interest as a state of domicile and the interests of the wife and children in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.374" offset="9746177">The Court, of course, has no obligation to decide those issues and can limit its decision to the issue of the continued viability of the presence basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.663" offset="9783375">But the... the case does involve... commend itself to these additional alternative grounds, should the Court desire to address them because they were raised below in the state courts and have been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.971" offset="9840636">They are in the record, and depending upon the approach that the Court would like to take, those issues are available for a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.092" offset="9877103">But if the Court desires to limit its decision to the issue of whether or not the presence of the defendant within the state and service of process upon him while he was present continues to be a sufficient jurisdictional basis, then my position is that the answer to that is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.923" offset="9956411">It has not only been... that principle has not only been established in Pennoyer v. Neff, but it has in fact been acknowledge by this Court in more modern decisions, including International Shoe, where the Court expressly acknowledged that the minimum contacts analysis related to service outside the state where the defendant was not present but at least by implication recognized that if a defendant is present within the state, that is a valid jurisdictional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.996" offset="10092665">The O'Neill v. New York case was also an application of the presence rule where the Court clearly said, the defendant being present in Florida, Florida had jurisdiction over him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.035" offset="10136864">So that all I'm suggesting is that based on the precedent established by this Court in more than one case over the last 100-plus years, an upholding of the judgment of the California courts can be accomplished simply by recognizing that the rule continues to be in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.919" offset="10232368">And I think it's particularly significant that when the commentators argued that Shaffer v. Heitner required at least a reevaluation of the presence rule, if not an outright abolishing of it, the American Law Institute did reexamine that rule and concluded that it was not appropriate to abolish the rule but instead retained the rule in a slightly modified version.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.237" offset="10341664">And I think this is an indication that the presence rule is valid, it's not unfair and unreasonable and it does lend certainty and predictability to the jurisdictional equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.079" offset="10404985">So, to the extent that this Court wants to limit its decision to that narrow issue, I would urge the Court to uphold the judgment of the California courts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Sherman</label>
            <text syncTime="2629.670" offset="10655447">--If the territory of the state extends to the air space, then apparently they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.972" offset="10672584">But it's not, as I started to say before the lunch bell rang, it's not because they're present in the state; it's because they were served while present in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.078" offset="10705080">You see, service while present is what accomplished transient jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.631" offset="10727232">I'm not contending that if somebody is present in the state that should not be counted in the minimum contacts analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.535" offset="10750846">If a person is present, he has a contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.768" offset="10759833">But then he's only subject to specific jurisdiction for causes of action relating to his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.324" offset="10790030">If he is served under the traditional rule, he's subject to general jurisdiction for anything, and that's what makes it unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.462" offset="10814585">With respect to the options open to this Court, it seems to me that the court of appeal clearly decided this case on the bounds... grounds of transient jurisdiction being okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.568" offset="10850948">I think that issue is directly presented here by virtue of the petition for cert. and the court of appeal opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.721" offset="10871637">In Shaffer v. Heitner, when this Court rejected quasi in rem jurisdiction even though the Delaware court had not reviewed the matter of well, but are there minimum contacts, the Court went on to do so, concluded not and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.779" offset="10919806">I think that's what the Court should do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.564" offset="10927016">But at worst for husband, the Court should abolish the doctrine of transient jurisdiction in its pure form, and then, if it adopts the restatement analysis or if it replaces it with minimum contacts, at worse for husband, simply remand that part of the case to the court of appeal to consider whether, now that it can't base it simply on service while present in the forum, what should it do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.061" offset="11008936">I'm quite confident that under California law it will reach the result which it reached in this case.</text>
