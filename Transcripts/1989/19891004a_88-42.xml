            <text syncTime="83.625" offset="473440">This case presents the question of interpreting the citizen suit provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.514" offset="517012">These citizen suit provisions are virtually identical in many other citizen suit provisions in other federal environmental laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.109" offset="559330">This case presents the question whether dismissal and refiling is required if there has been a failure to notify the government of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.900" offset="614501">In this particular case, through inadvertence on my part, I notified Tillamook County that it was in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the operation of its landfill operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.582" offset="673224">At the time that I notified Tillamook County, I intended also to notify the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.214" offset="699765">The statute requires that the EPA and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality also be notified of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.569" offset="733201">And I was aware of that statute and aware of the regulation, but somewhere between the execution... the intention and the execution something went wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.376" offset="772385">Nevertheless, a year later, the citizen suit was filed and approximately, say nine months later, Tillamook County moved for summary judgment, asking the Court to dismiss the case on the ground that there was lack of subject matter jurisdiction because notice to the government had not been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.820" offset="858171">Immediately after having received the motion for summary judgment I sent notice to the EPA and DEQ, upon learning, to my surprise, that I had not done so; in fact, I thought I had done so and was very surprised to learn that I hadn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.941" offset="926717">The case came on for hearing approximately 50 days after the motion was filed, and about 50 days after I sent a notice to the EPA and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.411" offset="980529">And, at that time, the District Court said that he thought it would be a waste of judicial resources, given the fact that the EPA and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality had not indicated either any objection or that they intended to do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.246" offset="1191912">After the district judge essentially said to me that I had done everything that was required because the defect had been cured, the case went to trial about two years later and an injunction was entered against Tillamook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.845" offset="1250321">A finding was made that it was in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.870" offset="1274354">So we are here today under this, what I consider to be a fairly unusual factual situation, to determine whether or not a dismissal and refiling would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.226" offset="1327853">The way to determine whether or not a dismissal and refiling would be necessary is to take a look at the statute itself to determine whether or not the statute makes giving the notice a jurisdictional requirement that would require dismissal and refiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.719" offset="1393786">Now, of course, the first place... this obviously presents a question of statutory interpretation and the starting point, obviously, is the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.154" offset="1427536">The text of the statute has one sentence that refers to the jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.010" offset="1454912">And that one sentence says that the District Court shall have jurisdiction to enforce an order brought in a citizen suit, enforce compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.455" offset="1504754">That is the one sentence that talks about the District Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.947" offset="1518756">The rest of the statute, the rest of the provision, refers to timing requirements of the notice and timing; it refers to how and who may intervene; it refers to attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.678" offset="1569642">And, in the most recent amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, there is also an additional requirement that if the citizen is going to bring an action for immediate endangerment to the health or the environment, that he must serve a copy of the complaint on the Attorney General and the administrator of the EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.291" offset="1660130">So the question that we have here is, are these additional requirements jurisdictional requirements--</text>

            <text syncTime="385.706" offset="1681760">I wonder, Mr. Buckley, if you are quite right in calling the question here, is it a jurisdictional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.750" offset="1705897">To me a jurisdictional requirement might mean that, if you had litigated this issue without it ever having been, litigated you case without the question ever having been raised all through the District Court, the Ninth Circuit, the judgment become final, you know, could it be set aside because the Court didn't have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.990" offset="1770890">We are not obviously talking about something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.132" offset="1783428">We're just talking about a precondition to the commencement of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.506" offset="1800983">Now, whether that is "jurisdictional" or not, I don't know, but I wonder if it is quite that stark a requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.215" offset="2571804">And it was thought that it would be a good idea to enlist the aid and the eyes and the ears of the citizens to uncover those violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.019" offset="4918958">In that particular case, the Army Corps of Engineers knew that the citizens were concerned about the dumping of polluted, dredged material on a beach somewhere, and knew that it was also, under statutory requirements, under the National Environmental Protection Act, the Marine Protection Act, and the Water Pollution Act, that it had to have public hearings and notices and certain time periods had to be... had to be observed, like 90 days for circulation of a draft environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.398" offset="5044555">And what the Army Corps of Engineers was... did was that it was so anxious to get the case going, that it shortcut those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.753" offset="5069946">It violated those statutes and let the contract out before the 90-day period had run, without any public hearing or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.318" offset="5104219">And the citizens found out that this contract was going to be let, and if they waited for the entire 60 days, that dredged material would have been dredged and deposited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.406" offset="5136506">And the Court said that it thought, in a footnote, that it was a jurisdictional requirement, but, at the same time, it said that it thought that there had been substantial compliance because the citizens had made their objections known to the Army Corps of Engineers several months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.624" offset="5193453">But, in that case, there had been no notice sent to the Environmental Protection Agency and there hadn't been any notice sent to the state Department of Environmental Quality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.592" offset="5241309">You know, long ago in the 1800s, this Court decided the Holy Trinity case, and went and said and provided the principle, that this Court said that it can look through the letter to the spirit of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.875" offset="5314452">And it gave several examples.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.815" offset="5998129">And in fiscal 1987, there were 239,000 cases filed, 270 of which were private environmental cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.694" offset="6041701">If the Court looks through West's publication of USCA, the citizen suit cases are very, very slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.298" offset="6072108">There is just not that many of them and the reason is because it is a very expensive business to get in, for a private citizen to get into the business of trying to enforce federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.773" offset="6105962">And, of course, the preferred procedure would be to have the government do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.476" offset="7456806">The answer we urge the Court to adopt is that the statute means exactly what it plainly and clearly says, that Plaintiff's failure to comply with the statutory notice requirement before filing their lawsuit, constituted a defect that compelled dismissal of the lawsuit.</text>

            <label>Mr. I. Franklin Hunsaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1988.491" offset="8092836">It has, but Justice O'Connor, those cases do not contain anywhere near the kind of clear language, we submit, that is in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.069" offset="8127213">It, I really believe that, as I said a few minutes ago, that the Plaintiffs are essentially urging, by their argument, that the word commence means maintaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.038" offset="8187086">And I submit that the concurring opinion of Justice Scalia in Gwaltney, and joined in by Justices Stevens and O'Connor, draws that distinction between commence and maintain, and it just, it's untenable to say that it means something other than what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.367" offset="8248421">But as to the argument that somehow this statute does not speak, the notice provision is not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.831" offset="8274230">As Justice O'Connor pointed out, I believe in her question, the subsection (a) which speaks in terms of jurisdiction... that provides that a citizen may bring this law suit, this kind of lawsuit... expressly begins with the words except as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section any person may commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.308" offset="8372137">So you can't read subsections (a) and (b) separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.960" offset="8394707">They have to be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.243" offset="8399931">And I think by saying that somehow, as the Plaintiffs have said, that subsection (b), the notice provision, is entirely separate, to use their words, from subsection (a) just doesn't follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.161" offset="8451549">It's tied in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.164" offset="8459595">And that subsection (b) is titled, "Actions Prohibited".</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.244" offset="8475895">And that was in the original act as passed by Congress.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="2088.956" offset="8494704">Well, now tell me why those words unequivocally say that if you fail to give notice that, something that is filed without the notice must be dismissed, rather than just stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.759" offset="8561995">Why isn't a stay with notice given then an adequate remedy for this failure?</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.042" offset="8583102">If there hadn't been the failure you certainly wouldn't stay a case, but the judge says I think it's a perfectly adequate remedy for this failure, for this unfortunate failure, to stay the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.934" offset="8646632">Justice White, I think it is not an adequate remedy, again because of the clear words, the use of prohibited--</text>

            <label>Mr. I. Franklin Hunsaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2134.871" offset="8678397">--Prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.402" offset="8680486">Prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.841" offset="8682263">No action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.142" offset="8687487">You cannot bring this action, it is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.764" offset="8697936">Or it cannot be commenced, begun, by filing the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.398" offset="8716535">They had... if you say it can be stayed, you said that the words prohibit and commenced are meaningless, or don't mean what they say, because you have said that you can go ahead and commence but we will stay, but you can't maintain it until you give the notice or the 60 days runs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.919" offset="8786544">So I think those two words show that the Congress did, in fact, intend for this to be a prohibition and require a dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.793" offset="8826041">But the more... I think an equally important reason is the overall statutory scheme; it wasn't to allow citizens to come in and file these suits without first triggering the administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.996" offset="8882883">And as this Court recognized in Gwaltney, the primary enforcement tool is supposed, should be the administrative agencies, either the EPA or the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.272" offset="8935964">As the Court said in Gwaltney, the central purpose of these citizen provisions, and they were talking about now the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts which are identical to this act, the central purpose of these provisions is to permit citizens to abate pollution when the government cannot or will not command compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.269" offset="9031990">And the Court in Gwaltney also said that the purpose of the citizen suit notice provision is to give the alleged violator an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance and render unnecessary a citizen suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.376" offset="9088415">But significantly they said it is intended to encourage citizen participation, but only as a supplement or secondary to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.623" offset="9117358">Justice White, if you say that you can simply stay these procedures, notwithstanding the fact that no notice has been given, then it seems to me you undermine the whole purpose of the statutory scheme which is clearly set forth that the primary purpose is to allow the agencies to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.577" offset="9201264">And, in fact, it is significant, as one of the justices pointed out this morning, that one of the, the statute clearly provides that if the government, the administrator or state has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action in a court of the United States, no citizen suit can be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.759" offset="9285900">That is in subsection (b) too.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.806" offset="9810126">I think the record demonstrates that while this matter went to trial the relief sought by the Plaintiffs was not anywheres near what they had wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.134" offset="9855474">And while the Court did enter an order requiring the county to bring about some corrections to the landfill, it refused to close down the landfill as the Plaintiffs had requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.971" offset="9894762">And it ended up not awarding any fees, as it was within its discretion to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.335" offset="9912212">But I'd like to amplify, if I may, on this clear bright line that we asked this Court to draw in this case because of the predictability aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.221" offset="9963830">If this Court draws that bright line and says that a citizen must give at least 60 days notice before commencing a lawsuit and if not then the lawsuit must be dismissed, I think you make the statute and its enforcement predictable, and you make it even-handed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.472" offset="10032793">On the other hand, if you hold, as the Plaintiffs contend, that the suit may be stayed until the requisite notice is given, you make every citizen suit amenable to appeals and after the fact wrangling over whether or not the plaintiff, the citizen, complied with the statute and whether adequate notice was given, whether the administrative agencies, if you will, were given that meaningful opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.269" offset="10131954">And I think that will surely guarantee endless litigation and wasteful litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.593" offset="10149299">It is significant in this case, or telling, that the District Court premised his decision denying the motion for summary judgment which was raised, which was filed as soon as the Defendant, the county found out about the lack of notice, based its decision on the fact that it would be a waste of judicial resources to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.196" offset="10227667">And we submit that what has happened has been a waste of judicial resources, and, in fact, if this Court were to rule in favor of the Plaintiffs as they contend that would amount to a waste of judicial resources in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.586" offset="10281270">It will impose a hardship on these Plaintiffs, no question, if this Court affirms the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.479" offset="10304780">But imagine what would have happened if in March or April of 1983 when we filed, when the county filed its motion, the District Court would have granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit because of the undisputed failure by the Plaintiffs to file their notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.680" offset="10373639">And Plaintiffs could then have given the 60 days notice and then refiled their lawsuit, as they indicated in their notice that they ultimately gave the EPA and DEQ a year after the lawsuit was filed, they could have refiled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.753" offset="10445946">We would have gone ahead, tried the case without any jurisdictional cloud hanging over the case, and we wouldn't be here before this Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.307" offset="10952095">This is, we submit, a case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.721" offset="10965783">It is not a case that asks the Court to adopt the best rule or to interpret one of its own rules or a rule of federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.286" offset="10996085">So to answer your question, Justice White, this isn't a case that poses a question is the stay more efficient than complete dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.682" offset="11033597">We submit that dismissal is required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.633" offset="11045404">Congress said that a certain type of action is RCRA, but brought without prior notice and a 60 day waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.903" offset="11098485">Such action is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.824" offset="11106217">We don't think there is any basis for this Court to adopt a stay which would be inconsistent with that ruling, because a stayed action was nevertheless commenced without prior notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.853" offset="11158357">Petitioners have framed the question as to whether the prior notice requirement is mandatory or procedural, and we think that that mistakes, that is their primary mistake, because it is both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.581" offset="11213215">It is a rule of Congress, a statute of Congress which is partly procedural but it is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.826" offset="11238188">We can see no exceptions in the express terms of the statute and we have heard no evidence from Petitioners which would evidence an implied exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.382" offset="11276431">They have mentioned in their brief a concept of equitable modification.</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.713" offset="11525744">The statutory scheme is completely coherent if it is applied according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.616" offset="11545388">In fact we, there may be some inefficiency in particular cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.580" offset="11565241">But that has never been a reason, as Justice O'Connor noted, to disregard the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.013" offset="11583004">And I don't know that there is, the Court need to be too concerned about sympathy for the Plaintiff in this case because the Plaintiff lost on its state law judgments which were vacated along with the federal court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.742" offset="11637861">So they have resurrected their state common law claims for trespassing and reverse condemnation and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.206" offset="11659699">That is largely beside the point, I just wanted to bring it up because it came up earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.389" offset="11680493">So we do not think this is a case like Newman-Green where the question is, does the Court have some authority to adopt a procedural rule in the absence of congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.347" offset="11728349">Congress has spoken to this question and we think that it is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.680" offset="11749665">We have seen no exceptions implied or expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.283" offset="11764085">To answer Justice Rehnquist's first observation, however, I suppose this case does not present the question whether the requirement is jurisdictional in its strictest sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.139" offset="11815494">Could it be waived if it is not raised by a Defendant, could it be noticed first by the Court on appeal or the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.424" offset="11840571">It does not present that question because it was raised by the Defendant in the summary judgment motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.089" offset="11867321">And, also, it does not present the question could the EPA waive or be estopped from asserting some sort of requirement to notes because the EPA frankly was not notified.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.391" offset="11948509">And they take the prior notice requirement seriously, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.867" offset="11982364">One, the government, the EPA in particular, is primarily designated to enforcing environmental laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.161" offset="12007546">They welcome citizen suits; citizens are encouraged to become involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.385" offset="12024473">But the EPA wants to know about these suits and they can have an effect in compromising or preventing some litigation, both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.422" offset="12060627">They can bring pressure to bear on a defendant or they could point out to a potential plaintiff you don't have a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.955" offset="12082779">And then with Rule 11 such a plaintiff might not come to courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.267" offset="12095944">So we think that really the incongruent result would be from Petitioners' reading of the statute, which would make the prior requirement somewhat trivial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.132" offset="12135441">Why would a plaintiff give prior notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.265" offset="12151951">If it is not raised it would be waived, and even if it is raised, you could give notice at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.038" offset="12171072">So we think that Congress certainly thought there was an important reason to have prior notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.021" offset="12195001">The EPA believes that notice is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.814" offset="12210152">So, we think that there is nothing to recommend an approach that would make that requirement, if not meaningless, less important and perhaps trivial.</text>
