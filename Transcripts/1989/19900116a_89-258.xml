            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="180894">Mr. Horn.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_chester_horn_jr" startTime="11.808" stopTime="197.077">
            <label>Mr. H. Chester Horn, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="191134">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.926" offset="203569">This case presents the question whether Section 16 of the Clayton Act prohibits a district court from decreeing divestiture of a supermarket chain in California acquired in violation of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.233" offset="256754">The issue arises from the attempt of the American Stores Company, the parent to Alpha Beta, the fourth largest supermarket chain in California, to acquire Lucky Stores, Inc., the largest supermarket chain in California, the acknowledged low-price leader, for the purpose of merging those two supermarket chains into one dominant firm controlling 25 percent of every consumer grocery dollar spent by California consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.651" offset="362498">The district court below found that that merger almost certainly violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.639" offset="390396">The district court found that that merger almost certainly threatens irreparable harm to California consumers in the form of several hundred million dollars per year in... higher grocery bills that the California customers will pay if this merger is allowed to be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.202" offset="464689">The district court therefore entered a preliminary injunction which it found necessary to preserve the remedy of divestiture and other possible relief to prevent that harm from occurring if it found, following a trial, that indeed this merger does violate Section 7 of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.164" offset="536473">The court of appeals in this case affirmed both sets of findings by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.500" offset="565835">It affirmed the finding that this merger likely violates Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.387" offset="581404">It affirmed the district court's finding that this merger threatens the precise harm that Section 7 of the Clayton Act was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.625" offset="614318">And it affirmed the district court's finding that California had made an adequate showing justifying preliminary injunctive relief on the record before it, which is the record before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.967" offset="663742">But, the court of appeals held, based on its prior decision in ITT, that the preliminary injunction was overly broad, solely because the remedy of divestiture is not available, a conclusion it reached based not on the language of the statute, based not on the overriding purpose of Section 16 of the act and based on none of the policies underlying the substantive provisions under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.333" offset="765201">Rather, the Ninth Circuit concluded, based on a fragment of the legislative history which was... it was presented with, that Congress did not intend solely to provide the divestiture remedy to private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.260" offset="820894">We think the Ninth Circuit's approach fundamentally misinterprets the approach prescribed by this Court in cases like Porter v. Warner Holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.132" offset="856421">The inquiry ought not to be did Congress intend to prohibit a particular form of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.602" offset="882230">The question is, by granting the injunctive powers for the courts to remedy antitrust violations, is there a clear and valid command by the Congress to preclude that relief.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="197.077" stopTime="239.356">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="197.077" offset="932176">Well, Mr. Horn, I guess the argument made by the other side in part is that at the time Congress considered this question and adopted the statute we are asked to examine, that there was generally regarded that there was a distinction between prohibitory injunctive relief and injunctive relief that required mandatory action, the so-called affirmative injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.631" offset="1058400">And their argument is that Congress had in mind only providing prohibitory injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.654" offset="1090478">Now, how do you respond to that argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_chester_horn_jr" startTime="239.356" stopTime="288.137">
            <label>Mr. H. Chester Horn, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="239.356" offset="1101241">We agree with American Stores that in 1914 the distinction between prohibitory and mandatory injunctive relief was well understood by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.360" offset="1133319">And if Congress had intended to limit private litigants to prohibitory injunctive relief it would have said so clearly in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.366" offset="1161322">That is not what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.281" offset="1168950">It provided the full scope of the injunctive relief to prevent... to prevent threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.839" offset="1207193">That is a long way from incorporating a distinction between prohibitory and mandatory injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.327" offset="1233211">And, by the way, the Ninth Circuit did not ground its decision on that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.862" offset="1251288">That is American Stores' argument to support the Ninth Circuit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.699" offset="1274694">The... that distinction is not supportable by the language of Section 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.520" offset="1293920">I think--</text>

            <text syncTime="288.137" offset="1296427">Now, Mr. Horn, the... the order here was one to hold and operate the stores separately, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.645" offset="1338432">Now, that is some kind of divestiture order in your view?</text>

            <text syncTime="304.132" offset="1360375">We think this is... the order that was crafted by the district court is a straightforward prohibitory preliminary injunction maintaining the status quo and preserving the possibility of all available remedies following a trial.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="316.772" offset="1410948">But that order has no purpose unless the court has the power to order divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.760" offset="1430906">I... surely you acknowledge that that... that that order is beyond the proper discretion of the court if the court cannot order divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.830" offset="1463193">Right?</text>
            <text syncTime="330.264" offset="1464865">I mean it... it assumes that if everything comes out a certain way, the court will order divestiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.572" offset="1510109">The district court could order, following a trial, a permanent hold separate of these two supermarket chains.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.743" offset="1538844">That is a permanent injunction which would fall squarely within even American Stores' reading of Section 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.712" offset="1558697">It would be prohibitory only, would order the American Stores to operate its firms independently of one another, and, for the reasons that we argued in the district court, while we don't believe that that is complete relief, we don't believe that that would be effective relief, it would nonetheless have the tendency over the long run to provide some relief from the injury threatened by this merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.507" offset="2545916">Turning to the language of Section 16, Congress provided to private citizens and the states the right to secure injunctive relief against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.001" offset="2599833">We believe this language is clear and that each of the three elements is plainly present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.905" offset="2623448">First, California sought in its complaint and the district court found that divestiture might be necessary to remedy the harm threatened by this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.011" offset="2659915">Secondly, California showed and the district court found that divestiture was a form of injunctive relief within the meaning of Section 16 that would prevent the very threatened loss that Section 7 was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.651" offset="2710488">And third, California showed and the court found that the injury threatened by this merger was that... that this merger was a violation to antitrust laws and threatened the precise injury which Section 7 was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.244" offset="2772868">Now, in light of American Stores' argument referred to by Justice O'Connor, it is especially important to note two things about Section 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.017" offset="2807872">First, Congress did not limit Section 16 relief to prohibitory injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.004" offset="2831905">Second, Congress did not limit the Section 16 to injunctive relief directed only at threatened violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.693" offset="2866596">Rather, Congress was focusing on injury to businesses and the consumers of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.030" offset="2891987">And it was focusing on that injury whether from violations which were completed or ongoing or would occur in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.286" offset="2921035">And there is not a hint in the language or the history of Section 16 that Congress intended to limit that statute to only future violations of one of the substantive provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.328" offset="3077143">And we think it is especially important to note that Congress went out of its way to specifically authorize private litigants under Section 16 to enforce Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.402" offset="3121446">That is important because in 1914 there was no Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.188" offset="3140568">There was no Securities Exchange Act by which private litigants would learn in advance that persons were about to make acquisitions which would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and threaten them with injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.645" offset="3186439">Private litigants would only learn about mergers violating Section 7 when they began to feel its effect, long after the stock had been purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.167" offset="3220503">And Congress could not have intended to provide a remedy which would be wholly superfluous to the very provision of the Section 7 that it was asking Section... private litigants to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.725" offset="3270762">A more natural reading of the statute does focus on the threatened injury that individuals face from completed violations, or irrespective of whether the violation is complete or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.857" offset="3563229">It is a standing limit which the government has never been required to show for it, to establish its rights to secure relief against antitrust violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.950" offset="3615683">Now, I would like to turn briefly, if I may, to the legislative history of the Clayton Act, since that is where the Ninth Circuit and American Stores' grounds what I think is the heart of its argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.524" offset="3669913">We know that Congress, in 1914, knew that Section 15 of the Clayton Act... or the Sherman Act predecessor, had given the government the right to both prohibitory and mandatory relief, and specifically the remedy of dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.636" offset="3734383">And we also know, by careful reading of the debates on the final conference bill in both the Senate and the House in 1914, that those two bodies were told by the floor managers of this bill that it provided the very same remedies under Section 16 that the Congress was providing to the government in Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.899" offset="3819438">We know that Representative Webb in the House told the House in the final conference debate that this bill was as strong in civil remedies as it could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.005" offset="3859876">And it seems to us that that cannot be true if the most effective remedy for violations of Section 7 was not being provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.344" offset="3893208">We think it is clear from those debates on the conference bill that the full scope of the injunctive powers of the courts was conferred on the courts by Section 16.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.078" offset="5232140">That is what the short form merger provision does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.899" offset="5247500">And the hold separate order was entered in place long before... or not long before, but before that merger law was activated by American Stores.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.382" offset="5661384">There is more at stake in this case than Section 7 or the availability of divestiture in this case, because its proposed distinction between the availability of prohibitory and mandatory relief under Section 16, if that is what this Court were to decide, would have a severe impact on enforcement of all the substantive provisions of the antitrust laws, not just this case or just Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.712" offset="5750723">It would require this Court, for example, to conclude that a person facing injury from the inability to have access to a central facilities controlled by a monopolist, in cases like Otter Tail or Associated Press, is entitled to no relief to redress that injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.488" offset="5813835">It would require the Court to conclude, for example, that persons facing ongoing injury from violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, in cases like Zenith and Silver, are not entitled to affirmative relief to redress the injury that they face from those violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.338" offset="6325208">It says nothing about any hold separate agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.123" offset="6336388">The brief appears to acknowledge the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's ruling on that aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.879" offset="6367317">And then, Justice Scalia, it is in footnote 1, and the way it is raised is, was this final under Delaware law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.485" offset="6401799">And if there is anything on which this Court did not grant certiorari it was to decide who was right as a matter of Delaware law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.590" offset="6438161">Now, the case really boils down to a simple matter of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.427" offset="6465538">The petitioner is quite right in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.779" offset="6479017">That in 1914 Congress expanded the package of remedies available to private plaintiffs to include equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.135" offset="6508378">And in that respect their relief is the same as that of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.789" offset="6531053">But the further proposition, that private remedies were to be identical to those of the Federal Government, is rejected by the statute on its face and by every rule of statutory interpretation that is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.947" offset="6579641">If the package of private remedies were identical, then why two separate sections?</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.080" offset="7612209">The first is we think that there is jurisdiction to dissolve a patent pool, that you can do that with a prohibitory injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.936" offset="7643556">Certainly there is nothing in the Zenith case, and certainly nothing in the Silver case, that would reject that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.458" offset="7677724">The second point that I want to make is that this distinction between prohibitory and mandatory is part of a larger distinction that is really the one that is the ultimate distinction in this case, between conduct on the one hand and structure on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.103" offset="7752225">And the one thing that is undeniable is that in Section 16 Congress referred to threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.495" offset="7801858">Now, the only answer, the only answer that the petitioner has to that language is that what they really meant to do by that provision was to incorporate the familiar... requirement of the familiar restriction that you have to show that you are going to suffer injury that is not... that is not redressable by... excuse me, for which there is no other adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.478" offset="7901750">And I have two responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.664" offset="7910527">In the first place, that just isn't what the... that is the only language, that is the only explanation they have for that threatened conduct language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.001" offset="7935814">And that just isn't what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.134" offset="7944382">If Congress had intended by that language to prohibit... to incorporate the familiar equitable requirement of inadequate other remedy, then Congress would surely... would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.212" offset="8012718">The language it used, threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage, just doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.433" offset="8029541">Moreover, by its express language, Section 16 does incorporate the entire package of equitable remedies, by this language:</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.216" offset="11224734">Let me just mention briefly, let me just mention briefly the... the statement by Mr. Brandeis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.504" offset="11265903">The Clayton Act was a major initiative of the Wilson Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.475" offset="11285756">And this Boston lawyer, Louis D. Brandeis, appeared on behalf of the Wilson Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.081" offset="11316163">And at this time the exchange with Messrs. Carlin... excuse me, with Messrs. Untermeyer and Rogers had already occurred, in which they had said you ought to give more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.537" offset="11362034">And specifically would it not have helped you if you could have brought suit for the dissolution of the trust?</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.857" offset="11383245">This section only gives you injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.543" offset="11397978">And then Mr. Carlin said to Mr. Brandeis it has been suggested to us that we ought to give the individual the right to file a bill in equity for the dissolution of one of these combinations, the same right which the government now has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.385" offset="11453358">And here was the response by Mr. Brandeis:</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.337" offset="11469241">"It seems to me that the right to change the status, which is the right of dissolution, is a right which ought to be exercised only by the government, although the right for full redress against future wrongs is a right which every individual ought to enjoy.

            <text syncTime="2848.482" offset="11537786">Now, a couple or three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.268" offset="11544891">One is that this statement, like Judge Hand's, shows, in answer to Justice O'Connor's question, that the word that they used in those days was dissolution, and indeed, in the second DuPont case, this Court observed just exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.129" offset="11612392">That dissolution and divestiture are largely interchangeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.081" offset="11628169">They have been over the years, and we so regard them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.735" offset="11646769">The second point, and even more important, is that regardless of whether you call it dissolution or divestiture or anything else, it is the change in status that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.959" offset="11695670">And there is no question that there is a difference in that respect between what the Federal Government can do and what everyone else can do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2923.216" offset="11836731">And you do not have behind it the kind of legislative history that you have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.322" offset="11877169">Should we... one of the metaphors that was used was grinding the poor defendant between the upper and the nether millstones of the Federal enforcement on the one hand, and then once he finished with that, then he has to go through another gauntlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.914" offset="11931503">There is no question they knew what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.283" offset="11944983">And what they were doing was exactly what these various congressmen responded to these New York lawyers, that they weren't going to give them: the same relief that the government had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.924" offset="11995556">That, in opposition our opponents refer to one legis... one piece of legislative history in which Senator Nelson did use the words same relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.767" offset="12050935">What he was really saying was same injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.468" offset="12065773">In fact, those were his exact words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.104" offset="12076222">The same injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.039" offset="12084058">Senator Nelson in fact did not take the position, and he knew that the relief was not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.110" offset="12108300">In any event the argument proves too much because no one contends that the two are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.328" offset="12129198">If they were the same, then the states would have criminal prosecutorial authority, which they don't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.001" offset="12159814">And later on, in connection with another statute... excuse me, with another section of the statute, Senator Nelson, who would have liked private individuals to have had this broad remedy, made that precise point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.226" offset="12208715">Doesn't it strike you, he said, as a bit unfair that Section 16, to which he specifically refers, gives this right of injunctive relief, but only the Federal Government has the broader powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.235" offset="12268796">Just a word about the relevance of Hart-Scott-Rodino.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.305" offset="12293038">It was an amendment to the Clayton Act, and as a consequence the legislative, the legislative history of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, under this Court's decision in Bell v. New Jersey, is persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.601" offset="12362210">By that time we were using the word divestiture in our lexicon, in 1976, and there was a proposal that state attorneys general be given this divestiture remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.241" offset="12408813">And Chairman Rodino, who of course was one of the sponsors of Hart-Scott Rodino, said in the clearest words which the English language is capable, the state attorneys general should not be authorized to file parens patriae suits seeking divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.918" offset="12471507">Now, my opponent's answer to that, his only answer, is that Chairman Rodino's views were really rejected later on by Senator Hart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.976" offset="12519781">The citation that they give simply do not support that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.613" offset="12538276">Senator Hart was not saying anything at all about divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.181" offset="12552591">What he said was that the courts, that the states do have the authority to bring parens patriae suits, and that that is sufficient and cites in support Georgia v. Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.674" offset="12606507">I invite the Court's attention to Georgia v. Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.709" offset="12618733">It is a decision by this Court, and of course obviously, if it had resolved the divestiture issue, then we would not be in this Court, because it would be dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.934" offset="12663559">All it said was that the states do have the authority to bring parens patriae suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.457" offset="12697727">That is what Senator Hart said was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.908" offset="12711520">He did not say anything about divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.526" offset="12721969">And the only statement on that comes from Chairman Rodino.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.062" offset="12740150">Just one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.097" offset="12752271">This case does not implicate any issues of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.203" offset="12784663">The policy issues for the State of California are of course to be resolved by the California legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.726" offset="12818726">And if the California legislature really wants its own attorney general to have this kind of power, then it should be for the California legislature to make the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.918" offset="12879539">Those are just as difficult policy issues today as they were in 1914, as they were in 1976, but they should be resolved in the initial instance by the California legislature and not by the attorney general.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.748" offset="13158841">In response to several questions from several justices, I think it is fair to say that American Stores agrees that this Court has decided, in cases like Zenith and Silver, that affirmative injunctive relief is available under Section 16 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.293" offset="13236999">And if they are not willing to go quite that far, they clearly agree that whatever that relief was it could be characterized as prohibitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.232" offset="13268764">It seems to me that this case is just like those cases in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.303" offset="13289035">The district court below, following a trial, could readily frame a prohibitory injunction prohibiting American Stores from holding the stock of Lucky or the assets of Lucky acquired in violation of Section 16 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.944" offset="13343578">It is probably worth remembering here that when this Court decided United States v. DuPont one of the things that this Court noted is that indeed Section 7 does prohibit not only the acquisition but the continued holding of assets acquired in violation of Section 7, and that is how the decree in the second DuPont decision was actually framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.707" offset="13426648">And... so the difference between prohibitory relief and mandatory relief is not going to get American Stores very far down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.546" offset="13457995">And it's a debate which really ought to be beside the point under Section 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.700" offset="13478684">Section 16 asks the district court to prevent injuries that face individuals and businesses from violations--</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.188" offset="13504597">So you think the big debate was just a lot of hot air before the Congress about whether private parties should have the power to dissolve a combination?</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.749" offset="13578889">Well, you could say well that's a prohibitory injunction, continuing to have the combination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.236" offset="13600832">--But the debate in the Congress in the early stages of the hearings before the Clayton subcommittee did not speak to the difference between prohibitory and mandatory relief, except with a minor exchange where he was urging that mandatory relief ought to be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.777" offset="13650987">And it is important to note about those early exchanges that they were discussing a much different bill than was ultimately introduced into the Congress and passed by that Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.650" offset="13686409">Section 13 of the bill that was being discussed in those exchanges between Representatives Floyd and Carlin and those witnesses was going to amend the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.005" offset="13723921">And it was not going to add the new substantive provision which is found in Section 7, which was ultimately added by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.159" offset="13756522">That debate focusses on a proposed amendment giving private litigants the right to seek injunctive relief against the trusts, the restraints of trade violations under Section 1 and Section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.967" offset="13803752">And that is precisely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.017" offset="13807931">And that is what, that is what Mr. Brandeis was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.419" offset="13817544">He was saying that the ability to attack these nationwide trusts, like the ones which Congress was so upset about in the decrees in Standard Oil and American Tobacco, that kind of attack really belonged in the hands of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.928" offset="13879611">But no one at that point was yet debating what relief was available to enforce Section 7 of the Clayton Act, because that bill was a separate bill which was not being discussed and would not have involved Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.336" offset="13933214">The separate bill was going to add a whole new provision of law not in the Sherman Act, creating this new substantive liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.342" offset="13957247">Now, it is important, I think, to again remember that the bill that ultimately came out of the Congress now--</text>
