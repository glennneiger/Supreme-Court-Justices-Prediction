            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="63.642" offset="396126">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.895" offset="409083">The Paperwork Reduction Act requires OMB to review agency information collection requests to determine whether they are necessary for the proper performance of the agency's functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.092" offset="453909">The question in this case is whether that review process applies to the Secretary of Labor's hazard communication standard, which requires employers to compile and maintain chemical hazard information for disclosure to their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.782" offset="512632">I would like to being by explaining how this issue has arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.375" offset="527052">I will then explain why the government believes that the hazard communication standard is subject to paperwork review.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.848" offset="548890">The Secretary first published a hazard communication standard in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.361" offset="570938">That standard, which applied only to the manufacturing sector of the economy, directed covered employers to develop written hazard communication programs, to compile and maintain material safety data sheets, to ensure that chemical containers are properly labeled and to provide their employers with training concerning workplace chemical hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.924" offset="653276">OMB conducted a paperwork review of that standard and approved it in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.639" offset="672084">The court of appeals for the Third Circuit rejected a number of judicial challenges to the 1983 standard in the decision known as Steelworkers I.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.455" offset="707401">The court took the additional step of ordering the Secretary to consider extension of the standard to the entire economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.569" offset="731852">The Secretary commenced a new rule making to consider that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.199" offset="746376">Respondents then initiated a contempt action, arguing that the Secretary was obligated to make that decision on the existing record.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.065" offset="773752">The Third Circuit agreed in the decision known as Steelworkers II, and the court threatened the Secretary with contempt sanctions unless she issued a final decision within 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.471" offset="811473">The Secretary complied with that order, and on August 24, 1987 issued a revised hazard communication standard covering both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.409" offset="859225">He also transmitted the revised standard to OMB for paperwork review.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.840" offset="876884">OMB solicited comments and conducted a public hearing on the revised standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.953" offset="897364">Based on that record OMB disapproved the paperwork requirements associated with three provisions of the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.138" offset="926098">Respondents then initiated a new contempt action, arguing that the Secretary's submission of the standard to OMB violated the court's previous orders, because OMB lacked authority to review the pertinent provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.428" offset="975209">The court agreed and invalidated OMB's disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.820" offset="988792">The court acknowledged that OMB is required to review information collection requests, but it concluded that the provisions at issue are insulated from OMB authority because they embody policy... substantive policy decision making, and because they do not require the collection of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.490" offset="1055457">The government seeks reversal of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.212" offset="1066428">As I stated at the outset, the Paperwork Reduction Act requires OMB to review information collection requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.138" offset="1102059">We submit that the court of appeals erred in concluding that the disapproved provisions of the hazard communication standard do not contain such requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.892" offset="1129122">We start with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.194" offset="1138317">The Paperwork Reduction Act defines an information collection request as, among other things, a reporting or recordkeeping requirement, collection of information requirement, or other similar method calling for the collection of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.153" offset="1190144">The disapproved provisions, which required employers to compile, maintain and disclose chemical hazard information, clearly fall within that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.377" offset="1223058">For example, the three disapproved provisions which specify an employer's obligations with respect to multi-employer worksites, FDA approved drugs and consumer products, all require employers to compile and maintain material safety data sheets in various circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.839" offset="1292858">Thus, the disapproved provisions plainly impose recordkeeping requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.029" offset="1465684">So that, for instance, a hospital pharmacist, in addition to having to package inserts that he would normally use in evaluating the drugs, would also have to compile and maintain a material safety data sheet for each of those drugs, with the exception of pills or tablets.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.865" offset="4004995">But as I have pointed out, that would exclude recordkeeping requirements, which is one of the main sources of coverage of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and which was, in fact, a major impetus for the passage of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.032" offset="4049716">One of the principal concerns of the sponsors was to clarify that the predecessor act, the Federal Reports Act, did in fact cover recordkeeping requirements, and those would be subject to OMB review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.020" offset="4141667">That's the kind of thing they wanted to be sure... it wasn't to keep, to have records for investigation or inspection by third parties, was it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.194" offset="4174268">Well, first we disagree with that, because I think that the Act has no express provision, nothing in the text suggests concretely that regular recordkeeping requirements that have, would not be viewed by the government, would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.864" offset="4236962">The definition of recordkeeping requirement describes any recordkeeping requirement... any requirement that a person maintains specified records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.079" offset="4273847">OMB has clarified that in its regualtions to indicate that in fact it does include records that are simply maintained for... by an individual, and are not reviewed by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.675" offset="4316270">In any event, the records that are maintained here are reviewed by OSHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.229" offset="4330480">For instance, the multi-employer worksite provision requires that the parties... prepare a written hazard communication program describing how the hazard communication program would apply in multi-employer worksites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.710" offset="4392338">That written form must be on the site when an OSHA inspector comes to visit and inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.682" offset="4412296">And that's one of the ways in which he insures compliance, by the fact that there is a written report, the written hazard communication program, that describes his obligations and how he is fulfilling them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.621" offset="4455973">So, in fact, the only difference between the OSHA situation and the SEC situation is that, in OSHA... in the OSHA case the OSHA inspector goes to the plant, while in the case of the SEC inspection, the materials are mailed to the SEC office in Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.436" offset="5951326">Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.420" offset="5975254">As Mr. Minear indicated at the end, but only at the end of his argument, we believe there are two questions here and that the ruling below rests on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.710" offset="6028335">The first question is whether the hazard communication standard, and in particular the aspects of the standard disproved by OMB, are information collection requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.562" offset="6107747">The second is whether OMB acted properly, taking into account the entirety of the Paperwork Reduction Act, and most particularly the portions of the Act that we reproduce on page 39 of our brief, which state that the authority of OMB shall be exercised consistent with applicable law and that nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as increasing or decreasing the authority of OMB with respect to the substantive policies and programs of departments, agencies and offices, acted properly in disapproving these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.492" offset="6351522">Our basic position, which has been foreshadowed by the discussion thus far, is that when Congress talked about information collection requests, as the language of the statute persuasively indicates, Congress was talking about the collection of information by the government and for the government use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.521" offset="6471581">The indications are numerous in this regard and we lay out the basic points at pages 24 and 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.466" offset="6563427">First of all, as has been pointed out, this statute has to do with alleviating certain burdens on private parties, and the burdens are defined as the time, effort or financial resources expended by persons to provide information to a federal agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.551" offset="7007718">I mean, this is a problem, and we quote the cases which have been particularly acute in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.626" offset="7044080">And in cases like Insurance Agents, the court said that the issue of whether the agency could regulate the economic weapons of parties when they were engaged in collective bargaining was, I think I have the quote right, simply not a question that was given to the agency to ask and answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.362" offset="7382941">And I do think that there is a problem in speaking in metaphors of this kind, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a basic kernel of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.783" offset="7460681">There is, it seems to us, quite a paradox in saying that if the agency wants to aggrandize its authority and Congress has provided for judicial review, the judiciary is to accept that aggrandizing step if it is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.361" offset="7571022">There are other areas where there... where it's quite plain that the question arises in the interstices of the statute within an area that is the agency's where that problem just doesn't arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.425" offset="7659212">But, for the purpose of this discussion, it seems to me that we have two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.444" offset="7703307">We grasp at both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.206" offset="7714382">First is that this isn't the kind of issue, when you look at the entire statute, in which OMB is entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.582" offset="7751894">Secondly, there is a limit in deference, and OMB, giving it deference, deserves to lose this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.709" offset="7804348">It does seem, to us, for the reasons I was starting to develop and that have been noted by various members of the Court, that there isn't a word in this statute which pushes towards the conclusion that Congress intended to cover as an information collection requirement materials which, as a substantive matter A has to provide to B for B's protection, as opposed to materials which, as the statute says again and again are provided to the government for its use either in policy making or law making or in law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.396" offset="8027120">The definition of burden, the use of the term collection by an agency in the critical definition, collection of information requirement, and the entire point of the exercise, which is to determine whether the information has practical utility, which is defined to mean the ability of an agent... of an agency to use information it collects, particularly the capability to process such information in a timely and useful fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.289" offset="8226696">Every part of the statute most fairly read speaks to the question which, not surprisingly the legislative history shows was the only question posed to Congress, namely, should there be a system of rationalizing and assuring that the bureaucracy's appetite for information for its own use, particularly in the planning stage, should be reviewed and should be subject to efficiency and other rationality controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.327" offset="8398895">Efficiency and rationality controls by an agency, namely OMB, which has an overall management function for the government, and which has no particular parochial interest in the information at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.070" offset="8485831">And we have no doubt that the Paperwork Reduction Act, in those terms, in its efficiency terms in assuring that agencies only ask for what they can use and demonstrate that what they are asking for can be, as the statute so strongly indicates, can be processed and assimilated in a rational way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.786" offset="8636714">Not surprisingly, OMB's spokesman at the hearings, and this on page 26 of our brief, said no one questions the basic need of the for information to plan, make policy decisions, operate and evaluate programs, and perform necessary research.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.552" offset="8739741">The question is rather, how much information is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.846" offset="8756877">So this was supposed to be a planning, programmatic type of effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.200" offset="8786343">There is not a word, despite the fact that there are a myriad of labeling requirements and myriad of other regulatory requirements concerning the provision of information to third parties in the legislative history concerning these very different types of regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.397" offset="8899088">And it seems to us that the kind of materials you have here, and the issue you have here, is different from the kind of issue that was discussed at great length in the legislative history and that is adverted to in the little, literal language of the statute in three different respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.426" offset="9007235">If an agency wishes to seek information for its own use, the inquiry, when the matter is reviewed by OMB, as I have indicated, is is more information better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.642" offset="9100126">Can you use this information?</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.294" offset="9110680">What are you going to do with it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.343" offset="9114859">How will you process it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.675" offset="9120188">How... what are your people doing now?</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.747" offset="9132518">How is this going to work?</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.359" offset="9142967">In contrast, in the situation that we have here, the hazard communication standard, the agency, under a particular statute, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and in particular its Section 6(b)(5) and 6(b)(7), face the question of how do you reduce the risks in operating circumstances of handling hazardous chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.868" offset="9268982">And the result was a determination that we are not going to ban the use of these chemicals, we're not going to regulate how they are used, what processes they are used by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.847" offset="9324884">But rather, we are going to take what seems to us on any account to be a far more passive form of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.723" offset="9360410">We are going to require that if you act to circulate these potentially hazardous chemicals in interstate commerce, you have to advise people what the chemicals are, what effects they may have, how they can adversely effect individuals, and how they can be safely used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.080" offset="9465840">And in those terms the comparison here is entirely different from the kind of comparison you do between more information and less information in a normal collection of information, or in collection of information covered by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.267" offset="9558627">Because the comparison is the burden on chemical manufacturers, the economy, downstream employers, of having... commanding control regulation or process regulation, versus the kind of burden imposed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.417" offset="9631248">There is nothing in this statute which instructs OMB how to do that kind of job, or which indicates that Congress thought that that kind of job was the kind of job that OMB should be doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.382" offset="9899055">But if it wasn't, given the fact that particularly in hospitals the people who were handling the materials were faced with quite different hazards, then the ultimate consumer would be... that you did have to provide these hazard warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.693" offset="9968332">OMB said if it is covered by FDA we don't care, at least outside the manufacturing sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.989" offset="10001455">The rationality of what OMB did here wouldn't survive, so far as at least we can understand it, any form of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.796" offset="10056730">But they said in the manufacturing sector, it's all right to protect people in the way that OSHA did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.873" offset="10089018">But outside the manufacturing sector, and hospitals are outside the manufacturing sector, it is not all right to protect people with these added warnings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2507.046" offset="10169684">Then, with regard to consumer products, OMB said that there was no need to provide the particular information that OSHA had required because the products were subject to review by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3599.538" offset="14539656">Now, if you refer to the Federal Reports Act and it's, the Paperwork Reduction Act's predecessor, Section 3506, it employed the very same standard for reviewing whether an information... whether an information collection request should go forward, whether it is necessary for the proper performance of the function of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.088" offset="14613844">What I think 3518(e) indicates is there has simply been no change in the standard of review that OMB subjects these information collection requests to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.115" offset="14649997">Now, the expansion, or the scope of an information collection request has been clarified to include recordkeeping requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.051" offset="14681762">That was one of the chief purposes of the Act, to clarify that recordkeeping requirements would be subject to OMB review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.625" offset="14712064">But all 3518(e) does is indicate that as an interpretive matter nothing except express... OMB has the powers that are expressly given here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.022" offset="14749576">And that includes the express power to determine whether a matter is necessary for the proper functioning of the agency.</text>
