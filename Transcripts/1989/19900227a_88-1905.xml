            <text syncTime="8.939" offset="185735">Mr. Caso, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony T. Caso</label>
            <text syncTime="15.693" offset="212693">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.811" offset="229202">Rightly or wrongly individuals in our society are judged, categorized and characterized by their associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.150" offset="258564">It is in fact how we define ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.768" offset="269013">Today's case concerns the freedom to choose those types of associations by which we will be judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.689" offset="300673">An example from recent history is very relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.958" offset="313735">Earlier this month at its convention, the American Bar Association adopted a resolution on the question of abortion rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.230" offset="342887">A 40-year member of that Association, an officer, was so offended by that particular ideological position that he felt compelled to announce his resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.603" offset="384370">The members of the California Bar Association have no similar right.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.173" offset="406626">This case does not challenge the right of California to regulate attorneys through a mandatory bar association.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.595" offset="436301">Instead, it asks whether having done so, may it also authorize the bar to, in the words of the California Supreme Court, comment generally upon matters pending before the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.403" offset="483530">So, both the right to the freedom of association and the freedom of speech are before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.057" offset="514146">Speech rights are implicated by compelled dues payments that are then used for political and ideological purposes, while association rights are implicated by compelled membership in an expressive association.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.900" offset="569526">Infringements upon these rights may be justified only by a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.304" offset="595126">The bar in this case identifies no such interest, yet, instead, seeks a blanket exemption under the so-called government speech doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.712" offset="636817">All attorneys in California are required both to... to belong and pay an annual dues payment to the State Bar in order to maintain their license to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.086" offset="682270">In addition to its many regulatory activities, the bar also engages in activities we've identified as political and ideological.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.941" offset="717692">These include lobbying on issues that range from environmental questions to criminal penalties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.559" offset="6804223">With regard to the constitutional question, it seems to me the issues are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.361" offset="6823344">This Court has laid them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.546" offset="6828151">First of all, so far as a state government in its activities is concerned, it must have a legitimate state goal in order to adopt a program that it wants to go forward with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.787" offset="6877052">The first test this Court has said is is this a legitimate government interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.806" offset="6893143">Now, let me say to you here in answer to your question, as the briefs say and despite the contrary claim that we haven't made it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.280" offset="6931073">We have identified from the beginning that the interest we're talking about is the interest in the advancement of the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.700" offset="6964719">Now, the first question is, is that a legitimate state goal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.838" offset="6981333">It seems to me no one can have any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.040" offset="6990110">Not only the advancement of the administration of justice is a legitimate goal, not only is it an important goal... and although I... I would dispute the fact that any of these cases require that it be compelling, I can't think of a more compelling interest than advancing the interest in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.566" offset="7060223">So, the first question is is the administration of justice an important governmental interest that qualifies?</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.988" offset="7085927">It seems to me the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.521" offset="7091988">Now, the second constitutional question, as I understand it, that this Court has laid down is, all right, if the legislature has adopted that goal, have they adopted reasonable means in order to pursue it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.796" offset="7137127">Here they have adopted a State Bar Act, they have created a state bar as a governmental agency to carry out the state purpose of bringing the lawyers' expertise to be available both to the public generally and to the legislature on the questions of the administration of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.500" offset="11135952">The State of California has set up an integrated bar association for the purpose of getting certain advantages in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.289" offset="11167090">And those advantages are to get the common collective view of lawyers on these various interests that they have undertaken, the advancement of the administration of justice and the regulation of the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.663" offset="11216618">Now, I suggest to you that it is appropriate to let the State of California set up its own government regulatory body and to impose taxes, impose dues, whatever the label is, upon the lawyers to support that organization as a matter of taxes and to accomplish a legitimate, important, indeed, if necessary, even compelling state interest: the advancement of the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.565" offset="11320167">That's why we believe this is ultimately important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.432" offset="11331661">And I would conclude with the final thought that if you look at the amount of money the State Bar spends for these few items of lobbying that the complaint is made about here, you'll find it's a tiny fraction of 1 percent, because seven-eights of the budget, as the record shows, goes for regulation of the profession and discipline... two-thirds go to discipline alone... and that only a tiny portion deals with these very few instances that have been suggested, all of which in our view are entirely justified.</text>
