            <text syncTime="9.856" offset="178952">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.949" offset="195252">In this case, the court of appeals for the federal circuit held unconstitutional an act of Congress, Section 502 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, that requires, as relevant here, the deduction and payment to the federal treasury of one and a half percent of an award made by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in favor of the United States claimant, and paid out of the security account established pursuant to the Algiers Accords that were described in some detail in this Court's opinion in Dames &amp; Moore against Regan.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.727" offset="378423">The one and a half percent fee is stated by the text of Section 502, and I am reading from page two of the government's brief, to constitute reimbursement to the United States government for expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of claims of the United States claimants against Iran before the Tribunal, and the maintenance of the security account.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.885" offset="511020">The statutory fee schedule not only was designed for that purpose, as the legislative history corroborates, but our experience to date has shown that the receipts from the fee in the aggregate not only do not exceed the purpose for which the fee was required, but, as we recount in some detail in our reply brief, page 12, note 11, they cover only about one half of the expenses of servicing the Tribunal and claimants before the Tribunal and the security account.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.925" offset="719164">And this is calculated against only the expenses of maintaining these institutions in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.030" offset="767647">No component was included, as it well might have been, for the preliminary expenses that were incurred by the government in negotiating the Algiers Accords themselves and in the military deployments that were undertaken to support those negotiations.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.128" offset="1032006">Because it is only the post negotiation maintenance of the Tribunal and security account that is taken into the calculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.249" offset="1076519">There is no claim in this case that the award was an inadequate payment of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.308" offset="1116748">Indeed, there is no basis for such a claim in this case, because the award merely effectuated the settlement between the parties that the appellees agreed to, and the award was paid in full from the security account.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.440" offset="1197309">There is, accordingly, no basis in the facts of this case for the dis... the court of appeals invocation of the concern expressed in Justice Powell's separate opinion in partial dissent in Dames against Moore, that perhaps some of the commercial claims of particular Americans would be used as bargaining chips for foreign relations purposes, for release of the hostages, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.017" offset="1367523">Since... and perhaps the security account would prove inadequate to pay the claims in full, even if the award is properly made by the Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.277" offset="1424575">Nor, may I add, has experience in general with the functioning of the Tribunal and the security account borne out the concern that these claims might be sacrificed.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.895" offset="1491135">We have, on page 21 of our brief, recounted that more than $1 billion of payments have thus far been made out of the security account to successful United States claimants, and that Iran has replenished the security account on 21 occasions when its balance fell below the $500... $500 million minimum that is, that requires it under the Accords to replenish the account.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.129" offset="1803977">The challenge here is solely to the one and a half percent fee rather than to the award itself, but it is a fact that the award was made by means of a negotiated settlement to which Sperry agreed, and that at the time the award was submitted to the Tribunal for its entry of an award and for payment of the fee, of the award, out of the security account, Sperry knew that the government had provided, through a treasury directive license, that two percent of the award would be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.904" offset="2011076">So that there was a basis in the settlement negotiations for Sperry to take into account the likelihood that a fee would be deducted.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.115" offset="2091951">It was many times the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.662" offset="2098116">You could say that Sperry knew about that when it made the settlement, so perhaps it should have gotten 25 percent more than it thought it should have.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.871" offset="2178991">Well, of course, I suppose Sperry could foresee that that fee would be declared unconstitutional, or unauthorized rather, by the United States claims court, so that still brings us back to square one, it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="561.320" offset="2384836">Therefore, Iran is able to make payments from the security account pursuant to awards entered by the Tribunal without having to call upon any other funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.612" offset="2437917">It can make these payments from funds that are not otherwise at its disposal for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.202" offset="2468323">So that the existence of the security account, pursuant to the awards, undoubtedly serves as an inducement for Iran to settle and discharge claims through that mechanism and through use of these funds that are not otherwise available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.788" offset="2550661">So there is, in that sense, a benefit being conferred in the negotiating process itself by the mere existence of the Accords and their implementing mechanisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.953" offset="2623281">Now, the one and a half percent fee, as I have recounted, constitutes what is known in the law as a user fee, since it is reasonably calculated merely to defray the costs of services being provided by the government for the special benefit of a limited class of persons using those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.877" offset="2759014">This Court has on numerous occasions upheld the validity of such a fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.635" offset="6242077">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.789" offset="6274677">In this appeal, the Court is presented with four distinct constitutional challenges to an act of Congress which attempts to retroactively authorize the imposition of these deductions from the awards of the Iran claims, Iran-US. claims Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.267" offset="6332565">These deductions work as the taking of property without just compensation, a denial of equal protection of the laws, a denial of due process, and also run afoul of the origination clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.653" offset="6378122">At the time litigants were forced to abandon their district court litigation and pursue their claims against Iran at the Tribunal, there was no legislative authority or policy in existence at the time which would have supported any user fee or any deductions from awards of the claimants at the Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.412" offset="6449175">The Algiers Accords, which established the Tribunal and forced us to proceed with our claims there, providing it as the only forum for adjudication, expressly provided that the governments would bear the costs of operating the Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.000" offset="6499539">There was no discussion of a user fee being charged or any deductions from awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.296" offset="6516676">Similarly, the Tribunal modified its rules of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.216" offset="6532349">At the time we filed our claim, UNCITRAL Rule 38 was modified to provide that the costs of running the Tribunal would be paid for by the contracting parties, that is the governments, not the arbitrating parties, and such costs could not be an item of an award between the arbitrating parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.241" offset="6596506">Finally, in May of '81, when the Senate had before it authorizations for funding the Tribunal and paying the State Department for paying the expenses of running the Tribunal, the Senate said this Tribunal is very important to U.S. interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.172" offset="6652199">We want the State Department to devote sufficient personnel and resources to the operation of the Tribunal to protect U.S. citizens interests abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.967" offset="6683337">Please keep us informed of the need for any additional resources or any additional personnel; nothing about charging a fee for the use of it, nothing about making a deduction from award to fund this particular expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.712" offset="6730357">When the treasury went ahead and assessed its... and issued its directive license in June of '82, that was some six months after the filing deadline for claims of the Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.067" offset="6775810">It did so without any prior notice and without any authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.143" offset="6792111">It did allege it had the Independent Offices Appropriations Act when it issued that license for a two percent deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.063" offset="6815726">But that just didn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.077" offset="6823771">We challenged that in the claims court, and then Chief Judge Alex Kozinski agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.294" offset="6844669">The Independent Offices Appropriations Act could not be used to justify a user fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.885" offset="6863059">So we have no express authority for charging user fees, we have no latent, perhaps inherent authority in the government to charge us a fee for any particular purpose for the use of the Tribunal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.939" offset="7727295">I think that that, there would be a retroactive problem, but even as to cases that were pending, or the day before they were filed, we have a situation where a revenue-related assessment, that is purportedly to reimburse costs, has no relationship to the costs that are sought to be reimbursed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.386" offset="7789048">The perfect example of this, I think, was brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.604" offset="7801900">Those that use the services of the Tribunal but don't get an award, or if there was a possibility of getting an award from a separate account, don't pay a single cent for the use of the Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.475" offset="7841397">And that was exemplified by the way the banks handled their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.223" offset="7856444">Under the Accords, they could file and present their claims to the Tribunal, and they have settled their claims there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.986" offset="7879432">Their claims, though, and their awards, are not paid out of the security account; it is paid out of a separate account in England, and no deductions are assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.327" offset="7908793">So here we have a separate set of successful claimants that are at least... have benefited as much as Sperry, have the same ability to pay, but are not charged anything for their use of the Tribunal or the benefit, that is argued that was so strong for us, to have the availability of the Tribunal's procedures to adjudicate our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.804" offset="7982772">When Justice Kozinski looked at the revenue-related assessment, he also made note that the government really did not have any other authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.098" offset="8019866">And if we look at what Congress has been told about the authority of the State Department or the treasury to assess these fees, in June of '85, when the act in question was under consideration, the State Department told Congress, we can't fashion an IOAA administrative fee that would satisfy the cost-benefit nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.980" offset="8095412">It would really take into account what are the costs of the benefits conferred as opposed to the costs of the benefits derived by users of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.851" offset="8130939">In December of '82, prior to us... Sperry, instigating this litigation, that was the, one of the first attempts at getting legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.548" offset="8197708">But we really need statutory support; we really need Congress to make the policy determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.218" offset="8216411">So here we have now knowledge on the part of the government, be it through one of its executive agencies, that it was assessing fees without authority, a determination by the U.S. Claims Court that it had no authority, and now, some four years after the Accords, some three years after the claim period had been closed at the Tribunal, but three weeks after the ruling by the claims court, a retroactive assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.536" offset="8313691">Now, the denial of due process in the retroactive area is looked at with a analysis of the cases of Heinszen and Forbes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.207" offset="12188382">And we had found that that particular administrative assessment was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.845" offset="12206877">The concept that the government could have done something differently at another time, and could have imposed a user fee if they could have designed one, really doesn't justify reaching back and changing it now, because they didn't do it at the proper time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.982" offset="12259435">They also established a mechanism that doesn't evenly charge the claimants who do successfully use it, whether it be to $40,000 or $4,000, it really doesn't matter, because it was taken without prior notice and without our ability to do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.820" offset="12318785">And we don't really need to speculate well, we could have gone and done something else, we might have gone and tried to get it paid from a different account, it might have changed our negotiations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.372" offset="12408960">And with the expectations from the Accords, the UNCITRAL rules, and the Senate report, that there was nothing going to be charged for the use of this, to reach back and change that is really, really where our focus is, the taking of our interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.539" offset="12461623">Our founding fathers recognized that even democratic governments could take and tax citizens' property to excess, so constitutional limits on the exercise of these powers were imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.862" offset="12503001">Here the government has invented a new concept of a user fee that is supposed to be outside of these constitutional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.266" offset="12528601">The Court should look closely at how the fee is defined and imposed before it gives the government constitutional carte blanche.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.342" offset="12552842">With due regard for these constitutional safeguards, the fee at issue is violative of the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3115.650" offset="12602057">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.337" offset="12612819">Under this Court's decision in Bradley against Richmond School Board, and related cases going back to the Schooner Peggy, appellate courts ordinarily are to apply intervening changes in the law to pending cases, even though those changes occurred after a final judgment was entered in the trial court, and even though the legislature did not specify whether the intervening change in the law would be applied to pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.870" offset="12743014">Now, surely, that is relevant to the question that Justice Stevens posed, for example, about whether Congress could specify that a one and a half percent fee for enforcing judgments should be levied and should apply to pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.376" offset="12829009">The bars to retroactive application on intervening changes in the law while pending, to pending cases, are simply not what they have been portrayed to be in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.305" offset="12920751">Even when the legislature has not specified, and under this Court's decisions, when there is a rational basis for the legislature to specify uniform treatment, including retroactive application, so that similarly situated persons will be treated the same, that legislative judgment should be respected by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.729" offset="13042377">Now, the Appellees complain about the particular manner in which the fee is calculated and that it isn't more precisely calibrated to the extent to which particular claimants used the Tribunal, the security account, the federal reserve bank, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.610" offset="13137985">There is considerable latitude in the methodology for imposing user fees, just as there is in rate regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.214" offset="13188349">I agree with that, Mr. Wallace, and it doesn't seem to me that to make the winner pay is very bad, but I don't understand why only those who use the particular payment mechanism should be those that were hit with the fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.959" offset="13251357">--Well, that... there is considerable expense involved in maintaining the security account and the services supplied by the federal reserve bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.375" offset="13304960">True, but you didn't calculate the total amount of the fees that had to be collected solely on the basis of that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.091" offset="13331918">You threw a lot of other weight into the total amount of the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.198" offset="13348323">So why should those, only those who use that particular aspect, be charged?</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.088" offset="13363892">Well, that is a, an easy method to calculate what bottom line benefit from the whole mechanism a particular claimant is receiving through a payment being made through the security account and through the rest of the mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.500" offset="13461486">And, incidentally, government agencies pay the one, the same one and half percent fee, as we recount in footnote 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.777" offset="13494609">They get their payments from the security account... federal government agencies that have claims... and pay the same one and half percent fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.509" offset="13525538">So there is no differentiation made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.710" offset="13542361">It is true that bank claims are treated differently, but the government incurs relatively little expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.223" offset="13576424">This was a reasonable and easily administered method of calculating how to apply the user fees without deterring claimants who might not succeed and use the entire mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.636" offset="13658031">Of course, other methods would have been permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.369" offset="13672973">In New York City, there is a flat charge for using the subway and you can ride as far as you please.</text>
