            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="52.136" offset="340749">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.181" offset="356945">This is a Freedom of Information Act case here on writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.537" offset="382336">The case involves Exemption 6 of the Act, the personal privacy exemption, which protects against mandatory public disclosure of government documents that meet two criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.283" offset="433327">First, the document must satisfy the so-called threshold test by qualifying as a personnel, medical or similar file.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.122" offset="468749">And second, if the threshold test is satisfied, it must be shown that disclosure of the document would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.447" offset="518068">This is the so-called balancing test of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.524" offset="530294">The question presented here involves the proper interpretation of the phrase 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.082" offset="568537">And the facts may be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.940" offset="580031">In September 1979 the Washington Post submitted an FOIA request to the State Department for any documents indicating whether two Iranian officials, Dr. Ali Behzadnia and Dr. Ibrahim Yazdi, were American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.949" offset="648054">The State Department denied the request on the basis of Exemption 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.993" offset="668220">After the Washington Post brought suit to obtain the documents, the State Department submitted affidavits from an Assistant Secretary of State saying that in light of the social and political conditions then existing in Iran, which were briefly described, any confirmation or denial by the United States government that either individual is a United States citizen would be likely to cause a substantial threat of physical harm to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.919" offset="787965">The affidavits also listed several recent examples of Iranians who had suffered serious harm because their names had been linked to the United States in official documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.257" offset="837285">Despite these unrebutted affidavits, the District Court ordered the State Department to comply with the Post's FOIA request, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.160" offset="876886">The D.C. Circuit held that the government had failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of Exemption 6 by showing that the documents requested constituted personnel, medical or similar files.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.185" offset="932997">There's no question that this was not a personnel or medical file.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.215" offset="949089">The court said that to qualify as a similar file a record must incorporate, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="213.429" offset="985974">"intimate details about an individual, information of the same magnitude that is highly personal or as intimate in nature as that at stake in personnel and medical records. "</text>
            <text syncTime="223.739" offset="1027247">The Court of Appeals concluded that the fact of current United States citizenship was simply not an intimate detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.641" offset="1058803">As a result, it ordered release of the documents without reaching the balancing part of the exemption; that is, without considering at all whether in light of the State Department's unrebutted evidentiary submission, disclosure of the documents requested by the Washington Post would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the individuals named in the documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.569" offset="1150545">If we should agree with you, Mr. Geller, do we sent it back for consideration of that element?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="260.692" offset="1174996">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.582" offset="1182519">I think it would be helpful to begin discussion of this case by stating first exactly what is and what isn't involved here, and then by stating exactly what the opposing arguments of counsel are, because I think that respondent's briefs have attempted to obscure the relevant issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.526" offset="1274365">As I just said in response to Justice Brennan's question, the question presented here is not whether the documents requested by the Post can be withheld from the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.616" offset="1306653">Even if this Court eventually agrees with the government as to the correct meaning of the threshold test of Exemption 6, there would still have to be a remand.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="301.863" offset="1339672">I'm curious as to why you say there would have to be a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.406" offset="1381885">Is the balancing test performed on the basis of a lot of facts that would be have to be ascertained at a trial, or is it just the judgment of the court before which the matter is pending that on balance, you know, A wins or B wins?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="317.544" stopTime="345.689">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="317.544" offset="1402365">Well, the Court of Appeals didn't reach the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.933" offset="1420024">We believe that the balancing test does require a weighing of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.556" offset="1442490">Now, the facts were submitted to the District Court and both sides moved for summary judgment, and I assume that this Court could reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.533" offset="1502362">It wasn't reached by the court below, and the respondents have not suggested as an alternative ground for affirmance that the documents must be disclosed under the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.861" offset="1503721">Neither side has briefed that issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="345.688" stopTime="349.342">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="345.688" offset="1515005">Well, what facts does the district court weigh?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="349.342" stopTime="465.547">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="349.342" offset="1529634">It weighs the public interest in disclosure of the documents against the magnitude of the harm, the magnitude of the invasion of privacy of the particular individual involved or named in the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.760" offset="1583237">And that is often a fact specific inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.195" offset="1601001">As I say, here none of the facts were disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.492" offset="1606225">The State Department's affidavits were not rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.474" offset="1622108">The Post moved for summary judgment, as did the government, and the district court granted summary judgment to the Washington Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.254" offset="1653245">Now, the issue before this Court then is simply whether the government should be forced to release these documents without having an opportunity to show the Court of Appeals that disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.386" offset="1717820">In other words, the question here is what sort of documents in government files that relate to specific individuals did Congress intend to make eligible for undergoing this balancing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.085" offset="1764632">Now, it's the position of the government that the threshold test of the exemption was meant only to screen out agency records that don't refer to any specific individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.533" offset="1810398">If an agency document either explicitly or by identifying characteristics does refer to a particular person, then we believe that what Congress clearly had in mind in enacting Exemption 6 was that release of the document would be governed by whether public disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the person's privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.165" offset="1892945">Now, considerations such as the intimacy of the particular facts involved, or the public nature of the information, or the fact that the information sought might happen to be located in court records somewhere or in books that were published by someone are not irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.879" offset="1951773">We don't say that those are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.394" offset="1957833">We say that it be taken into account in the balancing part of Exemption 6 rather than smuggled into the similar files test.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="465.547" stopTime="481.586">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="465.547" offset="1994405">Doesn't it seem rather anomalous, though, that information which is contained in admittedly public records would be categorized as information to which the balancing test might apply and which could be withheld?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="481.586" stopTime="566.349">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="481.586" offset="2058561">I think it would be anomalous perhaps if information that was available to the public could be withheld under Exemption 6, but that's not the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.536" offset="2102343">The question is simply can we make a specific inquiry into the facts of a particular case under the balancing test, or is any sort of inquiry into the harm to the individual foreclosed totally by the fact that there is a very, very narrow similar files test that is imposed on federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.917" offset="2175903">The Washington Post, on the other hand, embraces the D.C. Circuit's view that a court is precluded from engaging in any balancing unless the information sought not only refers to an individual, specific individual, but also is generically highly intimate; in other words, unless it's the kind of information that virtually everyone would like to keep private about himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.849" offset="2239642">Now, this case I think illustrates the differences between the two approaches very, very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.423" offset="2285931">Most Americans, whether they're naturalized citizens or were born here, would not consider citizenship to be an intimate personal fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.372" offset="2321771">They'd freely disclose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.419" offset="2325951">It is not an intimate detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.105" offset="2332638">But for current residents of Iran, for example, possession of United States citizenship might well be taken to indicate adherence to a particular political philosophical view that's out of favor at the moment, and disclosure of American citizenship--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="566.349" stopTime="567.380">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="566.349" offset="2397631">Out of favor where, back home?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="567.380" stopTime="1065.397">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="567.380" offset="2401810">--In Iran.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.036" offset="2404423">And disclosure of American citizenship as to them might not only be embarrassing but dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.971" offset="2432112">But the D.C. Circuit's construction of similar files fails to take that at all into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.234" offset="2453219">As long as some item is not considered by the Court of Appeals to be an intimate detail, generically intimate, then the courts and the agencies are precluded from engaging in any balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.557" offset="2498463">Now, perhaps this difference between the Washington Post view of the threshold test and the government's view can be put into even clearer perspective by the following hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.880" offset="2547783">Let's assume that some foreign leader such as Idi Amin or Qadhafi were to announce that he was going to kill every American citizen in his country.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.659" offset="2586862">And let's also assume that that leader, Quadhafi or Idi Amin or the Washington Post, would then make an FOIA request to the State Department listing 500 people who live in that country and asking whether they're American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.886" offset="2647779">Now, I don't think any of us would have any trouble concluding that under those circumstances that's not the sort of information that should be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.711" offset="2679126">It would not pass the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.303" offset="2685500">I think any court would conclude under those circumstances it would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.614" offset="2706712">What the D.C. Circuit says, however, is that because American citizenship is not generically intimate, then the agency is foreclosed from engaging in the balancing process, and the court is foreclosed from reviewing the agency's determination in a balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.561" offset="2770450">The evidence has to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.999" offset="2776197">Now, where does this intimate details test come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="665.122" offset="2792707">It certainly doesn't come from the language of the statute which doesn't use the phrase at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.558" offset="2810470">The threshold test of Exemption 6 talks of personnel, medical or similar files.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.116" offset="2840668">The key question then is when is a file similar to a personnel file or a medical file.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.176" offset="2868984">And certainly the common denominator is not that the file only contains intimate details about a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.016" offset="2900331">There's a great amount of information in government personnel or medical files that wouldn't be considered generically intimate by anyone: the color of one's eyes, one's sex or height.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.326" offset="2937530">In fact, citizenship information is almost always found in government personnel files.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.369" offset="2973683">Yet the D.C. Circuit has told us in this case that citizenship information is not an intimate detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.162" offset="3004925">We think instead that what all personnel and medical files almost by definition have in common is that they contain facts about identifiable, specific individuals, and it's that characteristics that distinguishes a similar file, in our view, and allows the agency and the courts to then apply the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.982" offset="3092174">The D.C. Circuit's notion of intimate details as the determinant of a similar file also doesn't come from the legislative history of Exemption 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.322" offset="3137523">What the legislative history clearly shows is that Congress wanted to protect vast amounts of information about individuals that were stored in government files if disclosure, as the House report put it, would harm the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.315" offset="3197500">But the House was confronted with the realization that it would be impractical to try to identify in advance every type of government file or every type of document that should not be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.792" offset="3263433">So what the solution was was to pick a broad similar files threshold test so that no item that refers specifically to an individual would be excluded from the exemption, but to rely on the balancing test to screen out which items of personal information should be withheld and which items shouldn't be withheld from the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.332" offset="3341592">Both the House and the Senate reports plainly show that the central part of the exemption, the crucial part, was intended to be the balancing test, not the threshold test.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.873" offset="3379730">And this Court reached the same conclusion in the Rose case.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.513" offset="3398330">And the Court of Appeals' interpretation of similar files leads to a number of anomalous results that Congress couldn't have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.416" offset="3433856">For example, under the D.C. Circuit's approach, information that is part of a government personnel or medical file could be considered for withholding under the Exemption 6 balancing test regardless of whether it's generically intimate because it meets the threshold test by being a personnel or a medical file.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.674" offset="3506894">But the identical information if it's contained in a government file other than a personnel or a medical file, it say be sitting right beside the personnel or medical file, the exact same information, it can't be considered under the balancing test unless it's generically intimate, because if it's not generically intimate, it's not a similar file under their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.399" offset="3593830">And this goes, by the way, even if it could be shown that disclosure of the information would work a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.692" offset="3631028">And let me give the Court an example of what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.769" offset="3647329">Let's assume that one of the individuals involved in this case, Yazdi or Behzadnia, had once applied to the State Department for a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.219" offset="3681079">If he had, he would have filled out a personnel form, and there would be a personnel file on him, and he surely would have been asked on the form whether he was a United States citizen, and somewhere in the State Department's personnel files would be the answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.510" offset="3734264">Now, if the Washington Post had submitted the request they submitted in this case, and if the State Department had found that answer in its personnel file, there's no question that it would have satisfied the threshold test by being in a personnel file, and the question would then be does it pass the balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.269" offset="3797272">And a court in considering the State Department's views on that issue would have to consider the unrebutted affidavits in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.016" offset="3828305">But because the information sought by the Washington Post in this case, if it exists in the State Department at all exists in something other than a personnel file, the D.C. Circuit has held that no balancing can be done, no inquiry can be made into whether it would work a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.227" offset="3913151">Now, I'd like to end by making a point that I alluded to earlier, but I think it's important enough to repeat; and that is that a broad reading of the term 6 will not result in the withholding of trivial or innocuous low privacy information in government files.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.921" offset="3995907">Despite the impression that the Washington Post and the newspaper amici have tried to create, the government's interpretation of "similar files" here would not result in wholesale nondisclosure of information that should be made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.118" offset="4052749">The Court should keep in mind, as I said earlier, that even if something qualifies as a similar file under a threshold test, a federal agency still can't withhold the information unless the agency also determines first if the information refers to a specific individual; second, that disclosure of that information would invade that individual's privacy; and third and most important, that any such invasion of personal privacy would be clearly unwarranted in view of the public interest in disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.761" offset="4183257">That's a very, very difficult burden for a federal agency to meet; and any determinations it makes in this area is of course judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.962" offset="4208125">But in contrast to the D.C. Circuit's test, at least disclosure decisions under this approach would be made on the basis 15 of rational criteria such as the possibility of harm to the individuals involved and not on the basis of whether the information happens to be in one file rather than another, or whether someone might consider it to be generically intimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.905" offset="4307809">Now, what we ask here is that we be given the opportunity to show that the information related to specific individuals requested by the Washington Post would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy before the State Department is forced to release that information to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.008" offset="4376250">If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.566" offset="4418463">I waited expectantly for my brother Geller to tell the Court what District Court Judge Robinson found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.204" offset="4449079">Since he didn't do so, I'm going to have to do so, because we come to this Court having won a judgment in the district court and having sustained that judgment on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.075" offset="4496517">Now, as the respondent in this Court, under the settled precedents of this Court we can defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals if there is any ground on which it can be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.584" offset="4554614">And I want to make quite clear at the outset we are defending that judgment not only on the ground that the Court of Appeals was correct in its similar files analysis, but also on the ground that Judge Robinson's balancing test was correct, even though the Court of Appeals held that supererogatory on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.356" offset="4645624">The government has consistently ignored what the district court did, but I want to emphasize that its conduct of the balancing test, which we submit was correct, is an alternative Ground on which we rely, because if this Court were to reverse the opinion of the Court of Appeals, it would have no effect on the outcome of this litigation unless you also find that Judge Robinson was wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.183" offset="12832922">If the government would withhold that information, which is very likely... we're only talking here... obviously the government can release the information under the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.962" offset="12860090">We're talking about a case that the government has decided not to release because it believes it would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3196.535" stopTime="3196.816">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3196.816" offset="12919544">--We would say it's a similar file, and the fact that it is public or is required to be filed publicly would be very, very weighty in terms of how the balancing test should come out, and it would almost certainly have to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.313" offset="12941487">But that's a separate question from saying that the government is not even entitled to make its argument that it would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.527" offset="12994359">Now, just one or two more things, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.182" offset="12996971">Justice Powell asked a question about whether harm is something the Congress was concerned about, physical harm, when it passed Exemption 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.132" offset="13032811">And the answer that I heard is that the legislative history is clear that Congress didn't mean to include that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.035" offset="13076383">And I would refer the Court to the House report which is quoted at page 19 of the government's brief in which the House says that,</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.434" offset="13133957">"The limitation, Exemption 6, provides a balance between protection of 48 the right to privacy and the preservation of the public's right to government information by excluding those kinds of files, the disclosure of which might harm the individual. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.073" offset="13148481">So we agree with Mr. Kendall that the legislative history is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.119" offset="13164677">And just finally in response to Justice Stevens' question, the regulations do provide that when an American citizen expatriates himself that the State Department is to send the record to the INS, which is to send the record to the Naturalization Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.284" offset="13237402">As Mr. Kendall said, there's nothing in the regulation that prohibits keeping that information secret when it's filed; but there is another answer as well, and that is that the regulation doesn't provide any time limit within which the State Department has to forward the information to the INS or the INS has to forward the information to the Naturalization Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.731" offset="13311172">So it might well be... we don't know whether the INS in fact gave the information to the Washington Post that they suggest... but it might well be that the INS was totally unaware if in fact Mr. Yazdi had expatriated himself, if in fact he was a citizen to begin with.</text>
