            <text syncTime="5.501" offset="99389">The first case I have is No. 80-1190, Pullman-Standard against Swint.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.591" offset="123735">It's here from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.088" offset="141707">It involves the case under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 brought by employees against both their union and their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.707" offset="188205">The claim was that the seniority system to which they were subject was racially discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.292" offset="214537">Under 703(h) of the Act to win the case, it wasn't enough to show that the seniority system had a discriminatory impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.877" offset="256855">It was necessary to show a discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.344" offset="270752">After a long trial, the District Court held that -- that the seniority system was not the result of a discriminatory racial purpose and that the differences, the seniority system imposed were not tainted by a racially discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.508" offset="359464">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that there was such an intent and that the seniority system violated the Act. We granted certiorari and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.143" offset="401991">For the reasons we stated in an opinion we have filed, we think the Court of Appeals disregarded the admonition of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which requires that the findings of the District Court not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.508" offset="487464">Justice Stevens has filed a statement concurring in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.244" offset="506377">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun has joined in part.</text>
