            <text syncTime="8.463" offset="111200">This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.463" offset="147249">Under the collective-bargaining contract signed by petitioner Kaiser Steel and the United Mine Workers of America, Kaiser was required to pay into certain union pension funds, a specified amount of money for each ton of coal that it mined.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.207" offset="226243">It was also -- it also promised in the contract to make similar payments with respect to each ton of coal purchased from other producers on which payments have -- had not been made into the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.249" offset="286430">This was a so-called purchased-coal clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.179" offset="298132">During the life of the contract, Kaiser paid the required money with respect to coal that it mined but it didnâ€™t make the payments with respect to a considerable amount of coal that it purchased from other producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.701" offset="356229">When sued by the pension fund trustees, Kaiser defended on the ground that the purchased-coal clause was illegal not only as a restraint of trade under the antitrust laws but as a hot cargo clause that was illegal under Section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.677" offset="436059">The District Court and the Court of Appeals held that even if the purchased-coal clause was illegal under the antitrust laws or the labor laws, he promise it was enforceable in a suit by the pension fund trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.670" offset="508052">We granted certiorari and we now reverse for the reasons that we stated in opinion on the file with the Court, we say no reason to depart from the historic rule that the courts will not enforce illegal promises, so the judgment is reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.939" offset="581195">Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Marshall and Blackmun have joined.</text>
