            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="77449">The other case I have is 80 -- No. 80-1990, Weinberger against Romero-Barcelo which is here from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.454" offset="127186">That Court held that whenever it is shown that a person is polluting coastal waters, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires the District Court enter an injunction and removes any discretion that the District Court might otherwise have to deny an injunction pending an application for a permit under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.152" offset="245991">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.585" offset="259784">For the reasons we stated in an opinion on file, we hold that the Water Control Act does not completely foreclose the District Court from taking equitable considerations into account and from denying injunctive relief pending action on an application for a permit which if issued would allow the pending discharges to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.393" offset="358945">Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
