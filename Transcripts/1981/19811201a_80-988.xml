            <text syncTime="111.054" offset="569234">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this action arose pursuant to a complaint filed in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Petitioners, Havens Realty and its employee, Rose Jones, violated the Fair Housing Act and Section 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.349" offset="634436">As to these Respondents, the complaint was dismissed on grounds of lack of standing and the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.503" offset="658991">The Fourth Circuit reversed, and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.372" offset="674455">The complaint here provided the sole facts before the Fourth Circuit and provide the sole facts before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.494" offset="710922">Havens Realty operates two adjacent apartment complexes in Henrico County, Virginia, and is alleged to have engaged in racial steering at just these two apartment complexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.368" offset="766511">Respondent HOME is a Richmond-based fair housing organization with the avowed purpose of making fair housing in Richmond a reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.423" offset="802664">Its activities include counseling, investigating complaints, and testing to ensure compliance with the fair housing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.096" offset="837355">Its only contact with Petitioner Havens was through its employee testers to determine if Havens was complying with the fair housing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.821" offset="876330">Its injury is alleged as a frustration to its counseling.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.308" offset="1010181">Let me speak to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.324" offset="1018331">One of the plaintiffs in this case, Paul Allen Coles, was a bona fide renter.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.295" offset="1034214">He was a party to this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.345" offset="1042364">His complaint withstood the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.014" offset="1057097">He went to trial, and a consent order was entered in his favor, in which Havens was found to have been engaged in racial steering.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.536" offset="1087190">That consent order, Your Honor, was addressed to Coles and his class, which was a class consisting of all black persons deemed to have been monetarily injured by those practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.391" offset="1126583">It can in no way, shape, or form affect the relief being requested by these Respondents, which is damages, other injunctive relief in the form of affirmative action, attorneys' fees, which will be substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.899" offset="1184575">We submit that under this Court's stringent test of mootness, this case can't be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.603" offset="1203383">As to the contention that the writ was improperly granted, Your Honor, we submit that for the same reasons evidenced in the cert petition, which are things not dealt with by this Court before, the tester qua tester issue, the dispute... the conflict between the Fourth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit as to organizational standing, that those are questions of important federal and constitutional law that are still in this case and are in no manner affected by the relief granted below.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.055" offset="1325218">HOME's membership... as to HOME's membership, we are told only that it is multi racial and numbers 600.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.042" offset="1357192">We are told nothing else about them, or where they live, only that Havens' conduct denied them the benefit of interracial associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.330" offset="1390315">The two individual Respondents, Sylvia Coleman, a black woman, and Kent Willis, a white man, are HOME employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.401" offset="1418632">They were not in any way bona fide apartment seekers, and their sole reason for contacting Havens was testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.824" offset="1448307">While we are not told precisely where they live, the complaint says that they lived somewhere in the city of Richmond or Henrico County, and that Havens's steering of these two apartment complexes deprives them of the benefit of interracial associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.286" offset="1514135">All acts as between Havens and these testers took place more than 180 days before the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.522" offset="1543079">Respondents complain that the district court's dismissal was precipitous, and that they should have been allowed to go forward and demonstrate their standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.378" offset="1574530">We submit that this is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.745" offset="1583935">They knew the facts before they filed the complaint, and if those facts aren't in that complaint, that is no one's fault but theirs.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.050" offset="1829172">--Your Honor, we would disagree that you have to assume any essential element of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.704" offset="1851846">We submit that there has to be, as required by Article 3, a plausible connection between the defendant's acts, between the defendant's acts and the plaintiff's harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.780" offset="1904091">It is implausible to assume that racial steering directed to two apartment complexes can affect two individuals that live somewhere in a metropolitan area of 400,000 people or in fact that they can affect the entire metropolitan area.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.979" offset="2312960">We think the Connelly v.

            <text syncTime="1807.399" offset="7354592">The case is before this Court in a somewhat unusual posture, and it presents a narrower issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.857" offset="7392418">The case is here on review from a grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.847" offset="7452395">The complaint was filed on January 19th, '79.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.899" offset="7468591">By February 16th, the plaintiffs were out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.620" offset="7483428">They appealed to the Fourth Circuit, which held in their favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.192" offset="7521776">While this whole appeals process was taking place, however, the companion case of Paul Coles, a black man denied housing by Havens, continued on to discovery and for trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.302" offset="7582171">After presentation of the evidence to the District Court, the judge found, and I quote from the findings of fact, that</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.500" offset="7679033">Because of the procedural posture of this case before this Court, review of the grant of the motion to dismiss and the finding that the defendant has violated the Fair Housing Act in Section 1982, we believe that this case presents only the issue of whether these plaintiffs, Respondents before the Court here today, should be allowed to go back to the District Court, pick up where they left off, and continue to prove their case, that they are entitled to relief from these defendants.</text>

            <label>Ms. Vanessa Ruiz</label>
            <text syncTime="2795.647" offset="11307546">Well, I think that when we talk about a continuing violation, we are focusing not on the plaintiff and the right asserted, but on the violation and the conduct of the defendant, and if the receipt of misinformation has been pursuant to an ongoing, continuing practice that violate the Act, we contend that even the person who brings an action under 804(d) for receipt of misinformation is entitled to have that claim survive on a subsequent incident which is within the 180-day limitations period, because it is part of one same continuing practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.532" offset="11519138">It is the defendant's conduct that we look to then, not the nature of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.519" offset="11551112">This case, as far as the injury claimed, as far as the pleadings filed, is really no different from the cases of Trafficante and Bellwood and Village of Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.586" offset="11651317">We think those cases are consistent with the Fair Housing Act and the purpose of the Congress in enacting the Fair Housing Act, and we urge this Court to affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>

          <turn speaker="everette_g_allen_jr" startTime="2897.329" stopTime="3101.895">
            <label>Mr. Everette G. Allen, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2897.329" offset="11714325">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.715" offset="11719863">To start with counsel's last point, it was that this case is like Trafficante and Bellwood, and I have to say that I think that's absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.688" offset="11767719">Trafficante allowed persons injured by discrimination against others to assert the rights, and we were talking about an apartment complex, where the act of discrimination, the racial manipulation was at that apartment complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.330" offset="11818292">Bellwood changed it a bit, because in Bellwood you had a village of 20,000 people, and you had a fairly sizeable area within that village of 12 to 13 blocks, and notwithstanding that, the Court had some difficulty and in fact refrained from allowing standing for two plaintiffs that lived outside of that target area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.480" offset="11926961">Now what we have done is, we have contracted the target area down to two apartments, and we have expanded the size of the area that the people can live in to a whole metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.240" offset="11985998">This is a quantum leap from Bellwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.192" offset="11997806">And if it goes that far, where does it stop next?</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.946" offset="12016823">In reading the Bellwood oral arguments, one question from the bench was, where does this end?</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.000" offset="12040960">And if we lived in northern Illinois, and we don't like what is going on in Bellwood, can we complain about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.821" offset="12064261">And the answer was, oh, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.821" offset="12068232">Oh, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.237" offset="12069904">We are going to be reasonable about this, and we are only going to deal with an area that is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.140" offset="12089548">Another question asked from the bench in Bellwood is, how many private attorney generals are we talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.878" offset="12112535">Well, in Richmond, Virginia, if this complaint is upheld, you are talking about 400,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.365" offset="12138449">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.234" offset="12145972">The question was raised, well, should we dismiss the writ as improvidently granted and opposing counsel says, well, we just want to go back and amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.840" offset="12184320">It has been admitted that the Fourth Circuit's decision in tester qua tester is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.660" offset="12207621">That needs to be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.860" offset="12212428">That can't be left standing by dismissing the writ as improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.481" offset="12230922">The representational standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.683" offset="12239699">The facts are not in that case to support representational standing, and no one can say that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.103" offset="12269375">Thirdly, this decision by the Fourth Circuit is such a far step from Bellwood that it shouldn't be allowed to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.109" offset="12305424">Mr. Justice Rehnquist raised, well, you know, why didn't you move to... why didn't you move to be given the right to furnish information later?</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.469" offset="12362893">The point was, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, they had this opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.004" offset="12376999">When the defendant moved to dismiss this case, they had an opportunity then to supply whatever facts they wanted to supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.924" offset="12408659">They have had no difficulty supplying them in this brief before this Court for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.562" offset="12427259">The important thing to note here is that these Respondents wanted to stand on this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.216" offset="12449828">They wanted this District Court to accept the broad allegations in this complaint and that is why they plead it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.719" offset="12479921">That is why they had final judgment entered under Rule 54, and that is why they have appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.523" offset="12495072">This isn't a matter of inadvertently doing anything wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.641" offset="12511582">This was a deliberate effort to have these broad allegations accepted by the District Court.</text>
