            <text syncTime="16.693" offset="180976">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the court of appeals in this case decided that the substantive terms of the collective bargaining agreement embodied in an employee benefit trust was subject to review by federal courts for reasonableness, under the sole and exclusive benefit provision of Section 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.673" offset="260806">This decision, we submit, is inconsistent with the intent of Congress, as revealed by the national labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.993" offset="290168">The national labor laws were based on private bargaining with governmental supervision alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.064" offset="306364">Congress was not concerned with the substantive terms upon which parties agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.516" offset="324231">Accordingly, this Court has on numerous occasions rejected attempts by federal courts to substitute their own judgment for that of the collective bargaining parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.622" offset="356623">Of course, collective bargaining agreements and collective bargaining parties are not subject to unqualified authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.708" offset="384940">A collective bargaining agreement may be reviewed and revised if it violates the Constitution or federal law, but absent such a violation, the collective bargaining procedure should not be interrupted, so long as that process was conducted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.035" offset="442305">The record before the court of appeals in this case clearly reflected that the agreement to exclude the widows and respondent's class was the subject of prolonged, intense, and informed bargaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Calvin Golumbic</label>
            <text syncTime="100.782" offset="517329">The issue was bargained from the day the bargaining commenced until, indeed, the parties decided to agree in order to agree to a final bargaining agreement in order to avoid a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.458" offset="580023">Given the fact, given the fact that the agreement in this case was the result of good faith collective bargaining, the court should have restrained, or refrained from reviewing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.372" offset="659644">Instead, the court decided to become a party to the negotiations and impose its own view of a desirable settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.609" offset="688587">The court justifies its intervention in this case by asserting that the eligibility rules of an employee benefit trust established through collective bargaining are subject to review for reasonableness pursuant to the sole and exclusive benefit provision in Section 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.070" offset="758387">The court, in support of that proposition, the court relies on a series of cases decided by the D. C. Circuit which involve acts undertaken by collective bargaining parties... excuse me, which involve acts undertaken not by collective bargaining parties, but by trustees of employee benefit trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.418" offset="843859">These cases do not support the proposition that authority to review eligibility rules for reasonableness emanates from Section 302(c)(5).</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Calvin Golumbic</label>
            <text syncTime="217.340" offset="983562">The cases were decided on the authority of a court of equity to review the discretionary acts of trustees, and in no instance did the cases rest on a jurisdictional basis under the Taft-Hartley Act, such as Section 302(c) or 302(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="231.949" offset="1041972">These cases demonstrate that the authority to review in each of the cases rested on the broad authority of a court of equity to review the discretionary acts of Taft-Hartley trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.209" offset="1106965">Other courts also decided that they have authority to review the discretionary acts of Taft-Hartley trustees, and these courts based their authority on Section 302(e), which in their view authorized the review of employee benefit trusts for a structural violation of Section 302(c)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="272.843" offset="1205498">The scope for review under the structural violation doctrine remains unsettled.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.978" offset="1222112">The Third Circuit has adopted a rather broad scope of review under the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.449" offset="1243951">The First Circuit has limited review under the doctrine to ascertaining whether employee benefit trusts conform to the express requirements of Section 302(c)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="291.238" offset="1279059">The reason for this diversity of views on the scope of review under the structural violation doctrine is apparent when the structural violation doctrine is traced to its origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.880" offset="1329632">Virtually every court which has adopted a broad construction of review under the doctrine begins with analysis of Section 302(c), with the cases decided by the D. C. Circuit upon which the court below relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.741" offset="1393162">But as we have shown, these cases do not rest on an analysis of Section 302(c)(5), but rather on the broad authority of a court of equity to review the discretionary acts of trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.584" offset="1456483">In this case, in this case the court of appeals lost sight of the equitable origin of its authority and decided that it may review a collective bargaining provision for reasonableness under the sole and exclusive benefit provision of Section 302(c)(5), but to say that Section 302(c)(5) imposes a standard of reasonableness under which the courts may review and revise the fruits of collective bargaining is to ignore the legislative purpose of Congress in adopting the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.222" offset="1583020">Congress adopted the Taft-Hartley Act, among other things, to prevent labor unions from using welfare funds for their own purposes, and to make sure that those funds were used for the benefit of employees of contributing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.911" offset="1629831">It is apparent therefore that the requirement in Section 302(c)(5) that welfare funds must be used for the sole and exclusive benefit of employees was intended only to prevent and prohibit the use of those funds for union officials and other non-employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.622" offset="1692630">It is equally apparent that Section 302(c)(5) imposes no limitation upon the eligibility standards adopted through collective bargaining for the payment of benefits to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.847" offset="1737560">So long as those collectively bargained eligibility standards do not permit the payment of benefits to persons other than employees, those standards, we submit, are not subject to review under Section 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.155" offset="1794821">Of course, of course those standards and collectively bargained employee benefit plans are subject to review for compliance with ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.962" offset="1837975">In ERISA, Congress adopted standards for employee benefit trusts, including standards of vesting participation in funding, standards for reporting and disclosure, and standards of fiduciary conduct, and significantly, Congress provided that any violation of these standards was subject to judicial challenge in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.411" offset="1931807">Certainly in enacting this comprehensive legislation governing employee benefit trusts, including a provision for the judicial review of a violation thereof, Congress believes that it was filling a regulatory void.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.838" offset="1989485">And in light of that fact, this... the existence of this comprehensive legislation undercuts all arguments for permitting the judicial review of collectively bargained employee benefit trusts pursuant to Section 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.155" offset="2098782">I thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.699" offset="2168999">The trustees concede three important points.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.984" offset="2186135">First, the trustees concede if they, the trustees, had formulated this provision, that it would be reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.857" offset="2225632">Indeed, there is no disagreement among the lower courts over the courts' power to review eligibility provisions which have been formulated by trustees, and that Section 302 prohibits the trustees from formulating eligibility provisions which would deny coverage to persons with substantial contributory work histories while granting benefits to persons with lesser contributory work histories, unless there is a rational nexus between the provision and a valid purpose of a 302 trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.236" offset="4447085">Congress in 1947 saw a potential for abuse whenever unions had any control over these trust funds, and provided that there would be review, and that... so that these funds would not become a union war chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.816" offset="4525453">Without 302's protections, eligibility decisions could be made solely on terms to further the union's benefit, not in a manner to further the beneficiaries' benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.874" offset="4573623">So, Congress intended 302 to be remedial; it provided a private cause of action, so that be enforced, and so that the rights could workers could protect their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.765" offset="4629211">Subsequent to Section 302's enactment, numerous federal court cases have ruled that eligibility provisions under a Section 302 trust cannot be arbitrary, that you cannot exclude persons with substantial contributory work histories at the same time you are granting benefits to similarly situated persons with lesser contributory work histories unless the trustees can show a rational nexus between that provision and a valid purpose of the fund, which is to reward workers for their contributory work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.598" offset="6160509">Well, the cases have shown that the mere saving of money is not a justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.900" offset="6181720">If so, any restriction, regardless of how arbitrary, would be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.971" offset="6206067">It is also interesting to note that after the various court cases which have held that there is judicial review of eligibility provisions, Congress did enact ERISA, and ERISA was enacted at a time when it was well established that there was judicial review of eligibility provisions which were formulated by trustees, and yet ERISA left Section 302(c)(5) in effect and ERISA in effect codified and strengthened sole and exclusive benefit standard which the courts have interpreted under 302(c)(5) to prohibit this type of arbitrary and capricious provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.118" offset="6394671">The Congress was concerned in enacting 302(c)(5) with the fact that workers' contributions could be subject to union manipulations, and the evidence in this case show that that indeed is a possibility whenever the negotiators are involved in this area, and the protection is the judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.871" offset="6513685">The trustees' position that these rules are unreviewable and do not have to bear a rational nexus to a valid purpose of a 302 fund, their position would open the door to unions manipulations of these funds, would allow the unions to accomplish at the bargaining table what would be unlawful for them to accomplish as trustees, and it would leave retirees and widows totally unprotected for under the trustees' argument these eligibility provisions could be drawn not for the benefit of the workers, but to further the benefit of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.166" offset="6686824">The collective bargaining of a provision does not afford any of the protections to an active worker which is required under Section 302(c)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.330" offset="6771461">The trustees' argument concerning Allied Chemical Workers is not correct, because this case does not involve a situation where the parties were being forced to bargain to impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.327" offset="6855471">The collective bargainers in this case freely undertook to create a Section 302 trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.445" offset="8023980">--That is what the district court found, and that is the incorrect standard to apply to a Section 302 trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.717" offset="8061074">The judicial review which is normally applied to collectively bargained contracts is a limited judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.922" offset="8101825">The review is normally applicable to cases in which you are dealing with issues which are relevant to active employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.534" offset="8172251">Now, the active employee has many remedies and many protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.086" offset="8194507">The active employee has NLRB protections, is afforded a duty to fair representation, has a voice in the union, has a vote in the contract, and yet the retiree or their survivor has none of these protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.697" offset="8256992">For the respondents' class, the only protection is the requirement in Section 302, and the requirement in the case law that these eligibility provisions not be drawn in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.207" offset="8323030">The testimony shows that the collective bargainers did not even consider the fact that there were men who were age eligible and years of service eligible to retire, but who had not retired and filed applications for pensions because they had continued working past retirement age in contributory employment, and had died while still actively employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.992" offset="8442148">There was no good faith, active, intense bargaining as to our group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.765" offset="8473182">There was no consideration of the cost of our group or of their merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.521" offset="8504215">The union negotiator, one of the union negotiators, Mr. Pearce, noted that there was no trade-off and that the respondents' class was omitted not on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.565" offset="8576418">As we mentioned, the reason that our class was omitted was because they were not considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.486" offset="8604107">The union only considered the vocal class that the union thought would embarrass the union after ratification of the contract, and when the bargaining stopped, our class was left out for no reason whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.563" offset="8664398">The trustees' position, if adopted, would mean that any provision, regardless of how arbitrary, could be readopted by the collective bargainers, and then there would be judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.072" offset="8722494">For instance, the signatory last employment requirement, which the defendant funds had, and which was invalidated in Roark v. Boyle and Roark v. Lewis, if the trustees in those cases had simply gone to the collective bargainers and said, the court says this provision is arbitrary, under their theory, the collective bargainers could say, we, the collective bargainers, think this is a good provision, and therefore the courts would have no review whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.948" offset="8873900">We contend that that position is not supported in the case law, that that total abdication of their fiduciary duties was not envisioned by Congress when it enacted 302(c)(5), was not envisioned by Congress when it enacted ERISA, and that there is absolutely no support for that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.313" offset="8971389">The trustees' argument that the cases holding that 302 places restrictions on trust funds have mistakenly relied on general equity law is not supported from a reading of the numerous cases from all of the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.046" offset="9078387">It is clear that the courts have held that Section 302, because of the fact that Congress was concerned that those persons who have worked in contributory employment receive benefits, the courts have held that 302 does supply substantive restrictions on the plans themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.810" offset="9169397">The trustees, of course, do not argue that collective bargaining imposed any protections on this class, and they have not shown any way in which judicial review would harm collective bargaining.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="2364.142" offset="9570743">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.861" offset="9573564">In fact, if the Court will permit me in a few words to expand upon my response to your question, in this instance the exclusion of the widows from lifetime health care was undertaken in good faith collective bargaining, and the economic wisdom and judgment of the collective bargaining parties in making that exclusion is not normally subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.025" offset="9658305">Absent a violation of federal law, as you pointed out, Justice White, in this instance, there was no such violation of federal law, although the court, the trial court decided it was a violation of Section 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley Act, and Section 302(c)(5) of the Taft-Hartley Act merely requires that benefits not be paid to individuals who are not employees of contributing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.688" offset="9744927">It does not impose a duty upon the collective bargaining parties to pay a benefit to any particular group of employees of 6 contributing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.460" offset="9780036">Interestingly enough, the respondents argue that notwithstanding the fact that the agreement was established in good faith collective bargaining, the trustees have a duty to modify that agreement to make it more equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.184" offset="9830922">And may I point out to this Court that the trustees have no authority under Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act to negotiate, and indeed, under Section 406 of ERISA, they are prohibited from acting on behalf of the collective bargaining parties, and to that extent the trustees may not negotiate benefit modifications that were raised in collective bargaining, and they may not negotiate those benefit modifications to the collective bargaining agreement, and try to give effect to benefit proposals that were advanced and rejected during the collective bargaining procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.274" offset="9979298">To the contrary, to the contrary, the trustees under Section 404(a)(1) of D of ERISA must comply and administer the wage agreement consistent with its terms, and solely for the benefit of the beneficiaries designated thereunder.</text>
