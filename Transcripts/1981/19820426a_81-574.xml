            <label>Mr. Noyes Thompson Powers</label>
            <text syncTime="11.028" offset="158938">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.761" offset="165834">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.588" offset="181194">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.069" offset="203032">It involves the proper scope of an employment discrimination class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.192" offset="227587">The Petitioner, General Telephone, challenges the so-called across the board approach to class certification of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.157" offset="263427">Under that approach the claims of applicants, employees and former employees can all be litigated in a single class action as long as the Plaintiff alleges that he and members of the class belong to the same race, sex or ethnic group and that each of them has suffered in some way from an employer's discrimination against their group.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.584" offset="369171">The facts of this case vividly illustrate why that approach is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.503" offset="396756">The Plaintiff, Mariano Falcon, an employee of General Telephone, charged that he was not promoted to a management job because he was a Mexican-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.702" offset="445553">In the civil action that followed, Falcon also sought to represent a class of Mexican-Americans who had applied for work at General Telephone but had not been hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.228" offset="503754">Without holding a hearing or stating any factual support for its action, the trial court certified Falcon as the sole representative of this class of unsuccessful applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.204" offset="563627">It did so despite the existence of facts which the company contends should have resulted in a denial of class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.217" offset="607617">For example, Mr. Falcon had never been an unsuccessful applicant at General Telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.948" offset="634575">Indeed, he was hired when he first applied as part of the company's affirmative action program.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.367" offset="668221">Moreover, Falcon's promotion claim was based on a disparate treatment theory of discrimination, while the hiring claims he presented for the class were based on disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.033" offset="726944">And the evidence which he introduced in support of his own promotion claim was entirely unrelated to the hiring claims of the unsuccessful applicant class.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.497" offset="776786">Finally, there was a conflict in interest of Falcon and the applicant class, because increasing the number of Mexican-Americans employed at General Telephone would have reduced Falcon's own chances of receiving the management promotion he sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.909" offset="862467">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.672" offset="889530">In so doing, it expressly relied on its own policy favoring across the board class actions in employment discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.136" offset="939372">The court held that the fact that Plaintiff's claims and the class claims were both based on alleged discrimination against Mexican-Americans outweighed the differences in the employment practices that Falcon and the class were complaining of.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.189" offset="1015545">The court did declare that there was a similarity of interests between Falcon's claims and those of the class based upon job location, job function, and other considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.136" offset="1083359">But it's clear from the record that the jobs that were included and those sought by the applicants went far beyond the management job which Falcon was complaining of not being promoted to, and there is no indication in the court's opinion or in the record as to what other considerations may have been similar between Falcon's claim and those of the applicant class.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.062" offset="1207075">General Telephone contends that Mr. Falcon is not a proper representative of an unsuccessful applicant class, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.571" offset="1265067">First, Falcon's promotion claim was not typical of the hiring claims of the unsuccessful applicant class.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.536" offset="1308952">This Court said in General Telephone of the Northwest against EEOC that typicality limits the claims of the class to those that are fairly encompassed in the representative's personal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.793" offset="1381991">That certainly was not true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.214" offset="1391604">Falcon's claim was based on a disparate treatment theory, while the hiring claims were based on disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.227" offset="1431728">And the evidence he introduced in support of his own claim was entirely unrelated to the claims of the applicant class.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.677" offset="1469449">And so we say that there's no typicality as required under Rule 23(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="344.002" offset="1490765">Indeed, the differences between Falcon's promotion claim and the hiring claims of the class are so great that we contend that in this action there is not even the necessary common issues of fact or law required by Rule 23(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="366.477" offset="1580730">And finally, because of these differences between the claims of the putative class representative and the class and because of the conflict that we have referred to in the interests of Falcon and the class, we contend that Falcon is not an adequate representative as required under Rule 23(a)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="394.715" offset="1693684">Let me restate at this time what the Petitioner is seeking in this action and what he is not seeking, what it is not seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.632" offset="1745302">First, General seeking, Telephone is seeking in this action the careful application of the elements of Rule 23 that this Court said was required in its decision in Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.516" offset="1816877">We're not seeking a per se rule that under no circumstances can an employee ever include applicants in a class action which he is bringing.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.212" offset="1875601">If there is a common policy that similarly discriminates against both employees and applicants, if there is sufficient numerocity and if there is no conflict in interest, then it would be possible for an employee to represent an applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.657" offset="1965462">But those elements are not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.062" offset="1975075">And that is the second thing that we are seeking, which is the careful application of Rule 23 to this case, and we say if there is such a careful application it will be clear that Mr. Falcon--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="482.117" offset="2043307">Mr. Powers, are you taking the same position the Government takes?</text>

          <turn speaker="noyes_thompson_powers" startTime="485.147" stopTime="538.313">
            <label>Mr. Noyes Thompson Powers</label>
            <text syncTime="485.147" offset="2055427">--Your Honor, the Government has supported our petition and says that in their judgment the Fifth Circuit across the board rule is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.049" offset="2106941">They would suggest that the Court base such a decision on lack of common questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.248" offset="2135780">We think that their argument is similar to ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.794" offset="2157932">As we indicated in our reply brief, while we think there is a lack of common questions here, we think that certainly there is a lack of typicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.570" offset="2197116">But however the Court chooses to define the defect, we think it clear, as the Government does, that the Fifth Circuit and the court below did not require the necessary symmetry of claims.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="538.313" offset="2268064">Well, they suggest that when the case is remanded that the class question be reexamined.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.514" offset="2292828">We certainly do not agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.763" offset="2301814">We see no need--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Noyes Thompson Powers</label>
            <text syncTime="548.451" offset="2308606">--We see no need for a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.683" offset="2317488">We think the record makes clear that Falcon is not a proper class representative, never was a proper class representative, that the initial certification was wrong, and that the proper remedy here or the proper action for this Court is as the Court acted in Rodriguez, which is to reverse with instructions to dismiss the unsuccessful applicants from the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.328" offset="2436084">Finally, we think it clear that the careful application of Rule 23 that we seek in this case will not mean the end of employment discrimination class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.725" offset="2513720">As I said earlier, when there is the proper identity of interests, where a policy is being attacked that affects various groups of employees and at various locations, Rule 23 would support a broad class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.187" offset="2591565">But we contend that there is not a basis for such a certification in this case and that the Court should direct the lower court, the trial court, to dismiss the unsuccessful applicants from this class and then proceed in accordance with this Court's prior remand for consideration of Falcon's own promotion claim in the light of Perdine.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="648.816" offset="2710056">Mr. Powers, are you asking for any more than the application of the traditional rule that a class representative has to be part of the class and possess the same interests and suffer the same injury?</text>

            <label>Mr. Noyes Thompson Powers</label>
            <text syncTime="658.905" offset="2750389">We think that's certainly the core of the relief that we are seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.434" offset="2780482">We think that when you look at the three elements of Rule 23(a) that we have cited, each of them provides a basis for reversal in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.709" offset="2837638">Not only is Mr. Falcon not an unsuccessful applicant, but his own claim of being denied a promotion is not typical of the claims of unsuccessful applicants, and we think he's not an adequate class representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.171" offset="2911512">We have... I would say a word also about the contention in amicus brief that the writ was improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.116" offset="2983297">We think nothing could be more erroneous than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.895" offset="2998343">The record is clear in this case that Rule 23 was not properly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.205" offset="3031571">General Telephone tried repeatedly in the district court and before the Court of Appeals to have Rule 23 properly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.762" offset="3081831">Its contentions were always dismissed with the contention that under the Fifth Circuit's across the board approach this type of action is permissible despite the differences in the claims of the class representative and those he's seeking to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.300" offset="3168035">There's no other place this employer can get what it's seeking other than before this tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.749" offset="3213801">What it wants is an end to this litigation of the claims of applicants, which has gone on for seven years, without this class representative having any personal interest, any personal experience regarding that particular element of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.114" offset="3295199">There's no question that at the time the court made its final certification at the conclusion of the trial that there was sufficient numerocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.032" offset="3346921">So this Court must provide the relief that we seek and only this Court can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.701" offset="3381612">The issue is ripe for decision, it's not moot, and again we simply ask that Rule 23 be applied as it's written.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.849" offset="3618177">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="879.721" offset="3633641">This case did not have a hearing on the class certification issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.687" offset="3661540">I think in order to understand this case one needs to put it in its proper historical perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.279" offset="3691947">This case was tried before Rodriguez, it was tried before General Telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.855" offset="3710232">It was tried right after Eisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.650" offset="3725383">And at the time, as the brief points out, that class certification issues were before the court, at least in the Northern District of Texas, the way they were handled was that the litigants representing the respective parties met in a pretrial conference, informal conference with the court to discuss potential class issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.343" offset="3824126">And that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.843" offset="3830187">The court entered an order in effect and advised counsel for both parties that they had, I believe, until October the 10th of 1975 to file their brief on the class action issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.914" offset="3898419">The Plaintiff, Mr. Falcon, filed his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.709" offset="3909599">The Defendant chose not to file a brief and deprived the court of any thinking it may have had on the class action issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.441" offset="3940528">In February of 1976, in response to interrogatories propounded by the Plaintiff, the Defendant answered them, and they were filed with the court immediately prior to a subsequent conference with the court to discuss the class action aspects of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.619" offset="4029240">Subsequently in March of 1976, after the court had an opportunity to view some of the factual data pertaining to the class and had an opportunity to review the Plaintiff's brief, the court entered a provisional class order and clearly made it known to the Defendant that the Defendant could at any time move or put on evidence, discuss, bring to the attention of the court, the class action aspects of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.650" offset="4177406">It was not until after the provisional certification of the class that the Defendant then did something to move to try to get the class decertified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.318" offset="4224113">It wasn't until that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.240" offset="4231741">And in that regard this trial court, I think, Judge Hughes probably handled this case as well as it could be handled in light of the time and the historical perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.983" offset="4286703">She did not give us a class unconditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.655" offset="4293390">It was provisional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.232" offset="4299764">She told the Defendant that at any time they could put on evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.203" offset="5971601">They had a promotional scheme here where they tried to promote from within most of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.296" offset="5991976">However, they did hire directly in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.575" offset="6001067">One of the class employees here actually applied directly for a field inspector's job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.510" offset="6036802">Some of the supervisors, the supervisors who did the evaluation on the promotion under the affirmative action program, which I doubt they were implementing very strongly, still were to interview and supervise the new hires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.330" offset="6104094">You have some... you have a same, similar job location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.797" offset="6130007">They all worked in the north Texas area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.312" offset="6131992">General Telephone drew their employees from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.091" offset="6151114">You have a lot of similarities, a lot of same interests and a lot of same injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.355" offset="6168250">And if you take those under Rule 23, if the court will take them and look at them individually... and I think that you have to do that on a Title VII class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.680" offset="6213494">And I think this record demonstrates, for example, quite clearly that Judge Hughes did not just go along across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.612" offset="6257276">I think the record will demonstrate that there was discrimination on a class-wide basis probably against black American males and females, there was discrimination against females on a class-wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.765" offset="6301893">But the court didn't give us that type of class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.247" offset="6319761">We limited it from a litigation standpoint to the individuals in terms of the Mexican-American promotion and hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.820" offset="6354033">Now, by the same token, I think that what I would like for the Court to consider is that there is no perfect class, that there's just not a perfect class; that Rule 23 doesn't require that you have a perfect class.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.640" offset="6597390">And in looking at the various aspects, in terms of numerocity there's no question but that numerocity was fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.900" offset="6646396">Suppose that... if we're going to limit, if this Court is going to limit classes of employees who can bring an action to that employee who has suffered the exact same interest or same injury, then we're going to have a multiplicity of litigation, and the Title VII litigant will not be able to wrong these remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.467" offset="6756632">And that's not the purpose and the intent of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.233" offset="6759767">I think that the analogy I like to think of is that if the Plaintiff with his counsel is a private attorney general under Title VII, then that attorney general, private though he be, cannot be, should not be, limited only to the very narrow claim or charge of discrimination that is filed by sometimes an ill-informed, uneducated individual who knows something is being done wrong to him but doesn't know quite what it is and perceives it to be based on race, sex, national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.543" offset="6928936">And so how is that private attorney general, how is he regulated?</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.620" offset="6953282">He's regulated in two instances: First, he's regulated by the EEOC and by the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.930" offset="6974494">That's where it all starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.866" offset="6986301">And in this case, for example, the EEOC, following Sanchez versus Standard Brands, sent the Defendant the request for like and related matters, to wit hiring discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.111" offset="7051189">The EEOC made a finding and a determination that this Defendant, this company, discriminated as a class against applicants in failing to hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.838" offset="7098105">So at that point it was brought to... this was long before this lawsuit was started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.318" offset="7148051">This private attorney general, that's his first regulating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.615" offset="7153276">The second place where he's regulated is by the district judge, and in the real world of Title VII plaintiffs' attorneys, when that original petition is filed you don't expect to put out all of the factual allegations that make up your class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.638" offset="7237390">You do expect to notify the court and the company that you are making class allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.729" offset="7253690">And now, under the procedure at least in North Texas, you have 90 days to file your class certification motion, at which time all of these issues are taken up, not on the merits, but they're all taken up to determine whether or not you can in fact sustain your burden of proof preliminarily on the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.642" offset="7353374">And there's nothing to say that once a class has been established that it cannot be decertified, which has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.374" offset="7376257">If you're going to follow this, this area, then the private attorney general should not be limited to having the private... to having a perfect class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.462" offset="7424636">Now, in reality what's going to happen, I believe, if across the board is not approved... and this was a term which I said was just developed by/the court... but if it's eliminated, as General Telephone would ask you to do, and this case is reversed and not remanded, what's going to happen to those 13 Plaintiffs who have now been absolutely proven to have suffered discrimination?</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.063" offset="7823055">--I think that we could try to amend and get a different class representative of that particular class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.014" offset="7850850">I don't think that's necessary under this case and I do think that Mr. Falcon was an adequate representative of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.338" offset="7888152">You know, there have been some allusions in the briefs to the fact that the Plaintiff perhaps didn't somehow prove his case or the statistics that they put into the record weren't somehow sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.067" offset="7955026">As a private litigant in Title VII, I have no qualms with Berdine, which says you have to prove your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.936" offset="7998494">I have no qualms with McDonnell Douglas, which gives you the four different ways, more or less, how you can rely on to do the prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.870" offset="8030259">But it escapes me how we forget that the burden of proof, although it is on the Plaintiff, should be no greater than the preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.756" offset="8077801">And the preponderance of the evidence in this case clearly demonstrated that this company discriminated in hiring, and the record and the statistics are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.739" offset="8109775">Now, the Fifth Circuit did remand because the court did not deal with the years 1974 and '75.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.577" offset="8137047">But I think looking at Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 17 and Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 20, that that will not be very difficult to amend or to expand upon in terms of additional findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.525" offset="8196920">I wanted to comment a little bit on the Government's position and the reason for, or at least the way that I envision the reason for private attorney generals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.174" offset="8255539">It deals with the Congressional intent of Title VII and the broad-based attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.652" offset="8329413">And I gather that the reason that it's called an across the board attack, at least in my mind, is that because discrimination to me is like a cancer, and you don't treat cancer very nicely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.510" offset="8340802">You attack cancer and you attack discrimination, and that's why they call it across the board, because when you find a company that discriminates against an employee because she's a female or because he's black or because he's a Mexican-American, this is... you attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.799" offset="8409974">And once you do find it, then you look.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.719" offset="8433694">Generally companies... generally companies who discriminate in one area will discriminate in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.030" offset="8450934">It's true, you have to look and see whether or not there's a central authority, one personnel office, whether or not it might just be one supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.808" offset="8490014">But all of that is done, particularly in the concept of Title VII and Rule 23, by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.461" offset="8516659">The Government in its amicus has changed its position, has changed its position from where it's been in Rodriguez, changed its position from where it's been in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.111" offset="8583219">I think it's significant that it did, because that's the public attorney general and the public attorney general we know is motivated not always by the same motivation that private attorney generals are, and that may all be well and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.119" offset="8651241">There are some problems with that, because public attorney generals tend to change quite often.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.225" offset="8683738">Private attorney generals and litigants may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.099" offset="8695232">And I think that's why this Court, and I think that's why Congress, has recognized that you need to have both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.307" offset="8807976">Now, what we are asking is that this Court do several things; that it provide not only plaintiffs, but it provide companies, management, with some clear-cut guidelines on how a district judge on a case by case basis can approach the across the board, broad-based, however you want to term it, challenges to employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.711" offset="8985609">We suggest that the same interests, same injury requirement from Schlesinger or Rodriguez be broadly viewed as Title VII has been broadly viewed if we are to reach the results envisioned by Title VII in eradicating employment discrimination; and that that broadness or the liberal approach to that rule be held in check, so to say, by the district judge by following the reasonableness test, by looking and being able to look at all the factors, not just one of the factors of Rule 23, by being able to concern itself with the various aspects that go into making up whether or not the claims are typical, whether or not there are common questions of law and fact, whether or not there's numerocity, whether or not there's adequate representation, but that the district judge have some guidelines for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.560" offset="9224995">We suggest that the local rule as it's promulgated in the Northern District under 10(b)(2) is a good model to follow, because it requires the litigants to face the class certification issue long before you get into the merits, and it requires it specifically by having you as a litigant set forth, in response to the seven different areas that it requests--</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.008" offset="9434810">But as I said, I think that the across the board attack method is a mere terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.783" offset="9501893">You could call it broad-based, whatever you want it to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.298" offset="9503983">We would ask the Court to affirm the Fifth Circuit, affirm or give some application to the across the board attack method, and to allow this case to be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.293" offset="9700005">It has been almost ten years since Mr. Falcon filed his complaint with the EEOC, and this litigation does need to come to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.918" offset="9706484">But more than that, the specific instances in this case are not such that the trial judge just merely said, okay, because you're a Mexican-American, or okay, because you're male, you're entitled to class action and I'm going to find there's discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.035" offset="9790912">That wasn't the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.799" offset="9798017">There was careful attention by the trial judge, without the benefit... you know, when we tried this case we didn't have Teamsters, we didn't know what disparate treatment versus or being analogous to disparate impact was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.902" offset="9866353">We knew there was discrimination at General Telephone and we knew we could probably prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.417" offset="9872414">And when we got down to looking at the statistics and to some of the testimony, it was true in certain areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.412" offset="9932391">And the judge didn't just surely not look and consider the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.926" offset="9934481">I ask this Court to look at the statistical evidence, look at the testimony of the EEOC investigator and the Plaintiff's exhibits, look at the letters from the General Services Administration which indicated in 1972 that this company was lacking in its employment of minorities, black, Mexican-American and females, particularly in managerial positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.480" offset="10028730">Look at the fact that in the management of this company there was one Mexican-American out of 66.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.351" offset="10052241">Look at the fact that this company in the Irvin Division, which the trial court limited us to, failed to hire any Mexican-American males from 1972 to 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.941" offset="10102605">And this was a company that was basically run by white male Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.566" offset="10113054">Look at the fact that this company used the so-called Operation Attainment only one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.513" offset="10184838">Look at the fact that it did not use its affirmative action program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.261" offset="10187868">The supervisors testified that they weren't familiar with it, even though it applied to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.620" offset="10193302">Look at the fact that most of the minority employees were at the lower end of the job scale and the pay level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.501" offset="10284835">That was the kind of testimony, those were the kind of things that led this trial judge to find that there was discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.689" offset="10289537">The statistical evidence and the other testimony led it to find that it complied with Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.110" offset="10291209">I don't think that you have to, in order to represent one member in terms of the employee or the applicant as to the promotional aspects, you need not suffer the same exact injury as long as you have the same interest and you suffer some injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.459" offset="10388593">Totally different from Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.053" offset="10390996">In Rodriguez there was no injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.049" offset="10422970">In Rodriguez there was no motion for class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.408" offset="10424433">In Rodriguez the trial court did not certify a class; the appellate court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.174" offset="10431539">Those are the differences from Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.029" offset="10478872">And in fact, in Rodriguez this Court recognizes that we are not unaware that suits alleging racial or ethnic discrimination are often by their very nature class suits involving class-wide wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.476" offset="10528714">That's what Rodriguez stands for, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.851" offset="10530177">Common questions of law or fact are typically present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.444" offset="10540521">We too want all of the courts to resolve this issue in terms of class-wide and class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.426" offset="10568525">If we're not careful we'll have fragmentation where the plaintiff's attorney, depending on the district judge, will either be litigating a statewide class, a national class, or a committee class, depending on where and how the court views the same interests, same injury, and the breadth and the scope of what a plaintiff can or cannot prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.319" offset="10684090">We too want this Court to apply Rule 23 carefully, keeping in mind that Rule 23 as it was finally amended came into effect finally, I think, in 1966, and Title VII was passed in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.026" offset="10802895">Rule 23 is not a civil right rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.760" offset="10809792">It happens to be a rule that's available to Title VII litigants, and with good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.660" offset="10873426">With that, we would ask the Court to remand, affirm the Fifth Circuit, provide some guidelines for litigants, for management, and for the district court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Noyes Thompson Powers</label>
            <text syncTime="2699.156" offset="10911460">Yes, I do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.578" offset="10917103">Your Honors, General Telephone is prepared to defend its hiring in the Irving Division whenever there is a proper charge and a proper complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.275" offset="10963914">But it is our contention that this case does not provide either a proper charge or a proper complaint for such litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.835" offset="10998082">And what we are seeking is an end to this litigation of hiring claims in an action brought by an individual who is not a proper representative of unsuccessful applicants and whose claim is not typical of their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.171" offset="11063493">Mr. Hernandez referred to the answers to interrogatories which were before the district court in connection with its consideration of class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.333" offset="11168087">Yet it's clear if one looks in the appendix at page 34, where the answer which the company provided... or which Mr. Hernandez provided concerning common questions is set forth, that he referred only to incidents involving promotion claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.998" offset="11230781">He never alleged anything in terms of a common issue affecting both 31 applicants and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.341" offset="11232139">It's also clear from the record that, while Mr. Hernandez talks now about the associational injury which Mr. Falcon may have suffered, that he stated during the trial in volume one of the record at page 355 that the first time that Mr. Falcon experienced discrimination was when he sought to pierce the management veil, as he referred to it, and he sought no relief from any personal injury that he may have suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.673" offset="11349481">So this I think quite clearly is an argument that's been advanced at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.156" offset="11375395">It's also clear from the record that the hiring was done not by supervisors, but by people in the personnel office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.885" offset="11418340">I would note particularly that the thing that it seems to the company is most needed in this area is for this Court to spell out more clearly to the lower courts and to litigants what Rule 23 requires in an employment discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.206" offset="11495663">There has been an unfortunate tendency to view Rodriguez as only dealing with inadequacy of representation, and not to recognize that Rule 23 has other elements that must also be carefully applied, particularly the typicality requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.353" offset="11584165">And it's our position, and we believe the Government supports that position, that certainly for a class representative to represent others his claim must advance their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.894" offset="11650412">If it doesn't partially establish the class claims, then it cannot be considered typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.406" offset="11692417">In conclusion, I would simply note that at page 11 of Mr. Falcon's brief he urges approval of a golden rule of reasonableness in reviewing class certifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.727" offset="11753648">We submit respectfully that there is nothing golden nor reasonable about the across the board approach of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.786" offset="11781965">It places absent class members at risk of conclusive judgments in cases brought by persons having no direct interest in their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.719" offset="11829716">It subjects defendants to the risks of successful collateral attacks in cases where a defendant is successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.012" offset="11874856">And it burdens both the court and the defendants with unnecessary litigation.</text>
