            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We will hear arguments next in New York against Paul Ira Ferber.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="36362">Mr. Pitler, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_m_pitler" startTime="48.397" stopTime="299.810">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Pitler</label>
            <text syncTime="48.397" offset="193515">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.016" offset="208039">The issue in this case is whether New York can make it a crime to disseminate materials, for example, a movie, which show a 12-year old child actually having sex with an animal or an adult without requiring that the entire movie be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.227" offset="272823">The purpose of this kind of legislation is, of course, to protect children from sexual abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.048" offset="304170">This purpose distinguishes this case and New York Penal Law Section 263.15 from the obscenity cases and statutes which have previously come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.439" offset="353698">In the previous cases, in the obscenity cases, the interests of the state are generally to protect the viewer, not to protect the people who participated in the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.199" offset="408764">That much is made clear by the opinion for the Court by Chief Justice in the Paris Adult Theater case.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.554" offset="442201">In that case three state interests were mentioned in support of general obscenity legislation, and all of those interests, without going into them, are aimed at protecting the viewer or the community from seeing the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.147" offset="496536">Indeed, the obscenity standard itself is designed, in talking of terms of community standards, appeal to the prurient interests, the standard itself is designed to protect the viewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.622" offset="554423">Here, the statute in question is not at all designed to protect the viewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.776" offset="575007">You know, one can say, pardon the expression, in terms of obscenity legislation to some extent you deal with a victimless crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.381" offset="609489">This statute and the concern here, we are not dealing with a victimless crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.952" offset="635716">We are dealing with a crime against a child who is made to perform any and every kind of sexual conduct by an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.093" offset="676362">And that child is made to do so generally, I would think, involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.497" offset="701962">He is cast in a role which will have a profound adverse effect upon him, and that adverse effect is both physical and mental.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.971" offset="743863">And I am not going to repeat what we have set forth in Appendix B to our brief about all the damage that is done to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.808" offset="775210">And the harm to children is not limited to the production process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.612" offset="794436">The child's privacy when he is made to appear in that film is forever invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.147" offset="816588">He knows in his mind that he is on that film and that film is being disseminated all throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.420" offset="841665">The embarrassment caused to him, the emotional and psychic trauma to him is quite grave.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.490" offset="869878">Now, our adversaries recognize that the state interest here is compelling at least with respect to the production part of the statute, in prohibiting people from using children in production of the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.981" offset="923899">There is no challenge to that part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.451" offset="937796">But once the production is completed and the sexual abuse, as we call it and I think properly so, is memorialized on film, our adversaries say the First Amendment then comes into play and you may not prohibit the dissemination of that material even though it was committed by committing a crime against a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.615" offset="1026403">They say this is especially so, because there are less restrictive ways to deal with the problem than an outright ban on dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.238" offset="1064856">They point to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.589" offset="1070289">One less restrictive way they think of dealing with the problem involved here is the production statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.743" offset="1098919">It is good enough just to ban the use of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.580" offset="1114279">We submit to the Court that that is not an effective alternative to the dissemination statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.634" offset="1138521">And the reason it is not an effective alternative, the dissemination statute, is because most of the production is done secretly.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.240" offset="1172898">They cannot be found out.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.240" offset="1180944">The producers are very, very difficult to infiltrate, very difficult to find.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="299.810" offset="1199229">Your submission is that the dissemination prohibition is essential to supplement the production prohibition, which you say you can validly do.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.037" offset="1276134">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.637" offset="1278537">In effect, it is part of a statutory scheme which is designed to protect children, and you cannot protect children just by the production statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.662" offset="1318557">Well, how can you... then how do you... I am sure you will get to this sooner or later and you may do it in your own course if you want to, but how do you explain then your prohibition of distribution on production that has taken place outside the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="346.172" offset="1384594">That certainly is not as a supplement to any kind of production that you are legally authorized to prohibit.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.777" offset="1415105">Well, one of the problems is that you cannot determine where the production takes place in a lot of these films.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.383" offset="1449482">It's impossible.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.201" offset="1472784">Suppose in a particular case everybody concedes the production took place in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.689" offset="1494727">Then what's your--</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert M. Pitler</label>
            <text syncTime="376.391" offset="1505489">--We would say that those films, in effect, would feed a market that would make it likely that children in New York would be used to make other films.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.597" offset="1550315">Basically, it's a kind of market analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.015" offset="1560033">It doesn't make a difference where the film is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.483" offset="1569855">It feeds a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.102" offset="1580408">People want to buy the films, there's a desire for more films, and then children, regardless of where they live, in effect, will be made to appear in these films.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.374" offset="1617398">And therefore, it would serve that purpose as well.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert M. Pitler</label>
            <text syncTime="413.830" offset="1655223">Or taking the New York children elsewhere to make films, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.968" offset="1675807">Now, it's our position that the only way that you can get at the use of children is to ban the dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.609" offset="1730351">It's really the least restrictive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.478" offset="1737874">So in effect, the distributors provide the economic incentive for making these films.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.214" offset="1760758">And this is something that's recognized in testimony before the Congress and from rather diverse sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.785" offset="1791060">From Charles Rembar to the L.A. Police Department, from Professor Tribe of Harvard to a senior editor of Playboy Magazine, everyone recognizes the best way, the most effective way and the most realistic way to get at the abuse of children in the production is to ban the dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.930" offset="1863680">The second alternative to the dissemination ban of New York is the obscenity standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.686" offset="1894713">In effect, limit the ban on dissemination to materials that are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.673" offset="1914671">We believe that most theoretically and realistically, that does not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.862" offset="1947376">First of all, as a matter of theory, as I said in my opening remarks, the obscenity statute is designed, and the standards that this Court has enunciated, is designed to protect the viewer, not the child who is made to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.872" offset="2007458">Moreover, even a work is not obscene in the legal definition, a child has been abused in the production of that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.411" offset="2049567">You cannot get away from that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.763" offset="2058971">And moreover, the obscenity standard, we would submit, is not a sufficient deterrent to deal with this particular kind of issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.051" offset="2096170">You have to prove... the obscenity standard requires you look at community standards, to the prurient interests, to whether there's a particular group involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.676" offset="2138697">And I think no case better illustrates why this is an ineffective deterrent than the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.747" offset="2162939">The defendant here was charged with both disseminating an obscene movie and just disseminating a movie containing sexual conduct of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.519" offset="2198047">He was acquitted with respect to the obscenity on charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.221" offset="2216856">And if you read the record, I thought that this would be a relatively simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.791" offset="2235141">You show the film to the jury... I don't know if the Court has seen the film yet but it is in the courthouse and it would be relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.210" offset="2268787">The entire trial was devoted in this case, despite the fact that these films were entirely devoted to sexual conduct, to... does this appeal to the prurient interest of a particular group?</text>
            <text syncTime="579.620" offset="2318420">Now, I would think when a child is abused in the making of a film, society shouldn't be interested in whether or not the film appeals to the prurient interest of a particular group.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.428" offset="2365649">We shouldn't be interested in whether there are other films out there similar to this film that are sold regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.099" offset="2396369">And we shouldn't be concerned about any particular group.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.634" offset="2410475">The jury was out approximately 12 hours in this case, all focusing on... all their questions show they were focusing on the obscenity question.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.139" offset="3420473">But I don't think when we're dealing with protection of children, that the New York legislature decide and I would hope this Court would hold, that have to run hope of acquittals in having an ineffective deterrent to the abuse of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.100" offset="3484317">That brings us to the statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.206" offset="3516813">Now, one of the problems before this Court of Appeals held that obscenity was like a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.662" offset="3558609">If the statute didn't require proof of obscenity, the statute was unconstitutional and therefore, there'd be no limiting construction possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.335" offset="3589329">They didn't deal with proposed limiting constructions or even go to it, because they said obscenity was the bottom line.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.988" offset="3615869">What I'd like to do is to go through the statute and at least show why, on its face, the statute is not over-broad, and in the course of that, to at least offer some potential limiting constructions that the New York Court of Appeals might and probably would consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.383" offset="3685460">First,... and it is 263.15 of New York's Penal law and it is found, I believe, on page 3a of the Appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.156" offset="3728614">Now, we have shorthanded the statute a little bit, but basically, it prohibits dissemination of material depicting the sexual conduct of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.100" offset="3788382">And the sexual conduct we think is defined in pretty precise terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.969" offset="3807817">It's bestiality, sexual intercourse, sodomy, lewd display of the genitals, explicit simulated... any of the conduct simulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.145" offset="3860480">And if these terms sound familiar, they certainly are because they are right from the Miller versus California standard talking about the hardcore kind of sexual conduct that could be prohibited in the obscenity context.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.637" offset="3914501">Now, amici and our adversary have suggested that the term "lewd display of the genitals" is vague and that would deal with just simple nudity.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.325" offset="3949296">I think that a reading of this Court's opinion in the Miller case and the Paris Art Theater case and the New York Court of Appeals case in People versus Heller shows that that concern is totally unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.783" offset="3995063">Now, it's true the New York court has not yet had a chance to interpret the statute, but lewd exhibition or lewd display of the genitals, at least as far as this Court is concerned and the New York court is concerned, feels it a patently offensive depiction, designed to appeal to an interest in sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.162" offset="4060578">Now, the amici point to medical texts saying these medical texts would be covered by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.815" offset="4091193">But I don't think there is any way, I don't think any reasonable person, I don't think any prosecutor, I don't think any jury, I don't think any judge and I don't think any bookseller can really look at a medical text and think for a second that that is a lewd display of the genitals within the meaning of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.341" offset="5329293">The fact, that they use the word "lewd" and they didn't use simple nudity to describe the kind of conduct, so there really isn't a problem with respect to the term "lewd".</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.299" offset="5477146">There is some simple nudity but this statute is very carefully drawn, it does not cover simple nudity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.286" offset="5501074">What it does cover is nudity when accompanied by an explicit, simulated sexual act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1434.723" offset="5738789">Now, even assuming that the First Amendment somehow requires some kind of limited exception for educational, medical and scientific material, it certainly can be read into the statute if the New York Court of Appeals would choose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.452" offset="5825724">Amici has suggested what we think is a fine standard, and that is educational, medical and scientific materials which as an essential part of their presentation contain depiction of sexual conduct by children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.046" offset="5880163">The fact that the statute doesn't have it doesn't make the statute fatally over-broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.748" offset="5898971">It's something that, once, could be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, or even the court of appeals if it chose to do so, could read it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.269" offset="5929064">The other kind of over-breadth that is pointed to, and I think it can't be serious, is what I call the dissemination kind of over-breadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.475" offset="5969816">Previously I was talking about content over-breadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.261" offset="5980996">What I mean by dissemination over-breadth, I sent these films to the court, pursuant to a request from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.498" offset="6005969">Literally under the statute, I have disseminated the films.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.950" offset="6023732">Now, even though I was a prosecutor, I didn't feel prosecution,... I don't think anyone... I wasn't discouraged at all, I wasn't worried about it at all, and I think the so-called dissemination over-breadth is just not a real threat, at least with respect to the situations that they posit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.661" offset="6094576">For example, giving the copies of the films to the news media to show so that the news media will write stories about the films, and give them to the television media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.315" offset="6125192">I don't think there's a real fear and certainly could be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.017" offset="6136059">By the way, the statute expressly gives an affirmative defense to librarians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.235" offset="6152882">So you don't have any concern with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.373" offset="6169391">And although the statute uses the word "procure", I don't think it means in the possessory sense, but rather, procure for the purposes of further distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.145" offset="6204500">But simply, the statute, we think, is crafted to deal with a very, very serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.835" offset="6239295">A problem that cannot be dealt with by simply prohibiting the use and production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.488" offset="6261864">Seeing my white light, I have five minutes, I would like to reserve that time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.981" offset="6427899">It is my view, Your Honors, that the New York Court of Appeals condemned this statute because it imposed significant burdens on freedom of speech without any assurances that it would give any added protection to the young people of this country, beyond those already provided by two, what I consider to be, very effective statutes: the law that makes it a felony to use a child in the production of a film or a book, and the law that makes it a felony, increases punishment, if a person sells that book--</text>
