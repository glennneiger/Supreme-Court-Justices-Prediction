            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="77438">I have for announcement the opinion for the Court in No. 80-1285, Brown versus Hartlage.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.912" offset="117040">It's a case here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.716" offset="140236">Petitioner Brown defeated respondent, Hartlage in the 1979 general election in Kentucky for the office of Jefferson County Commissioner, and respondent brought this action in a state court to have the election declared void alleging that petitioner had violated the Kentucky Corrupt Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.571" offset="243681">The alleged violation consisted of a campaign speech by the petitioner in which he promised that if elected, he'd lower his salary by $3,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.801" offset="304599">The Corrupt Practices Act prohibits candidates from making any promise as to action when elected, if that promise is made in consideration for a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.428" offset="355067">And the Kentucky Court of Appeals held that petitioner's promise did violate the Corrupt Practices Act and rejected respondent's -- or petitioner's argument that it so construed the Act violated the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.974" offset="417239">And the Court, therefore, declared the office vacant and ordered a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.131" offset="441898">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.868" offset="448899">It's of course true that states have a legitimate interest in preserving the integrity of their electoral processes, but when a State seeks to uphold that interest by restricting speech, limitations on state authority imposed by the First Amendment are manifestly implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.073" offset="501667">When a State seeks to restrict directly as this Kentucky Act does, the offer of ideas by a candidate to the voters, the First Amendment requires that the restriction be demonstrably supported not only by a legitimate state interest, but a compelling one, and that the restriction operate without unnecessarily circumscribing protected expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.662" offset="632070">The Kentucky statute as applied to petitioner's promise violates the First Amendment under that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.042" offset="661536">The Court of Appeals analogized petitioner's promise to a bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.146" offset="685987">However too, that may be as a matter of Kentucky law, there's no constitutional basis upon which petitioner's pledge to reduce his salary might be equated with a candidate's promise to pay voters for their support from his own pocketbook, like a promise to lower taxes, to increase efficiency in government, or indeed, to increase taxes to provide some group with a desired public service, petitioner's promise to reduce his salary cannot be deemed beyond the reach of the protection of the First Amendment or considered as inviting the kind of corrupt arrangement, the appearance of which I state may have a compelling interest in avoiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.208" offset="854215">There's no showing that petitioner made the promise other than in good faith and without knowledge of its falsity, or that he made it with reckless disregard, whether it was false or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.011" offset="901445">Moreover, petitioner retracted the promise promptly after discovering that it might have violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.492" offset="927358">Under all the circumstances, nullifying petitioner's election victory was inconsistent with the atmosphere of robust political debate protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.910" offset="973020">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Kentucky Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.716" offset="1004262">Justice Rehnquist has filed a concurring opinion, concurring in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.472" offset="1023280">The Chief Justice concurs in the judgment.</text>
