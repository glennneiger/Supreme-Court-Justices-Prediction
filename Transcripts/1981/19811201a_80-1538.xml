            <label>Mr. Richard L. Arnett</label>
            <text syncTime="30.083" offset="120268">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the questions before this Court today may and indeed based on the last year's experience will dramatically affect the future of the state of Texas and some of its school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.766" offset="171050">Texas sits geographically right on top of the hub of Mexico's population, in contrast to California, where the bordering state of Mexico has a population... had a population of one million in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.135" offset="228519">The four Mexican states bordering Texas had populations of six million.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.258" offset="245029">It is approximately one-third as far to Brownsville from Mexico City as it is to San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.990" offset="267912">When one considers the problem of familial migration into this country, it seems reasonably clear that Texas is indeed the state which will be most dramatically impacted by this type of illegal migration.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.031" offset="320052">When one considers the fact that Mexico's population is doubling approximately every 20 years, and that approximately four and a half million children of school age are out of school in Mexico right now because of lack of adequate facilities, it doesn't take a great deal of imagination to understand the Texas legislature's concerns for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.554" offset="418168">With the federal government doing very little to control the problem other than to deny its largess to illegal aliens, and I use that term because it does describe the people that Texas seeks to exclude from its schools, persons who are illegally present in the country, but as I say, with the federal government doing very little, nothing at all realistically, to help the impacted school districts in providing a basic program of education to their residents, be them legal or illegal presently, the Texas legislature enacted Section 21031 of the Texas Education Code in 1975 to curtail the drain of the state's educational resources and those of its districts, which drain only promised to increase in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.330" offset="613251">Now, Section 21031 basically codifies two distinct provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.404" offset="645538">One denies state funding on the basis of the attendance of pupils who are not lawfully admitted into the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.590" offset="666331">The other exempts from the requirement for tuition-free admission that is imposed upon the districts those children who are not lawfully admitted into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.805" offset="707187">Those two provisions conceivably could differ in result in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.224" offset="728816">The latter, not requiring school districts to admit them, in essence leaves it at the discretion of local districts to review their circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.205" offset="772807">Now, we have raised the issue, and it has been invited certainly by the decisions of this Court, the consistent language of the decisions of this Court, concerning whether illegal aliens are in fact protected by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.057" offset="840202">Our concerns rest more with the manner of the application of the equal protection clause than they do the application alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.023" offset="867997">Texas has no interest in legislating in an irrational manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.255" offset="888999">However, Texas is very interested in having their legitimate interests recognized by this Court, and in the event that they are, we see no problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.845" offset="931318">It largely... the application of the equal protection clause largely presents a policy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.703" offset="942811">We don't really have too much to add to what we have put in our brief on that point, and with the limited time we have here today, we would like to address the manner of any application, as well as the underlying state interests at issue here.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="250.884" offset="1003520">Let me ask one question, counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.898" offset="1015536">If the equal protection clause is not protective of undocumented aliens, could the state of Texas impose harsher criminal penalties upon them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_l_arnett" startTime="264.675" stopTime="290.024">
            <label>Mr. Richard L. Arnett</label>
            <text syncTime="264.675" offset="1058691">Well, you may have Eighth Amendment problems, it would seem to me, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.627" offset="1078439">Certainly were the equal protection clause not applicable, and I might add that we have restricted our argument in that respect to governmental services; it seems to us that that is the one area which may do the most... may cause the most judicial interference with political decisions in this area.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="290.024" stopTime="304.909">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="290.024" offset="1160046">There can't be any question, can there, that an alien, documented or undocumented, brought before a criminal court is entitled to the same due process as any other person in the United States?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_l_arnett" startTime="304.909" stopTime="529.226">
            <label>Mr. Richard L. Arnett</label>
            <text syncTime="304.909" offset="1219605">No, Your Honor, it is not, and it may well be that the due process clause in that respect may be read to answer the problem that Justice Blackmun posed as well as that which is also posed by the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.718" offset="1266834">But in addressing the application of the equal protection clause, the first thing I think we need to look at is the nature of the class at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.618" offset="1310407">One of the intimations and accusations in this case that I would like to dispel immediately is that this statute embodies any racial animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.880" offset="1359517">This whole case originated in 1975, when a district on the border, Eagle Pass, which has a 95-percent Mexican American population, decided to enact a policy precluding illegal aliens from admission into their schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.983" offset="1415837">The Attorney General of Texas was asked for his opinion as to the legality of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.543" offset="1442168">The response was that under our statutes existing at that time, all residents of any classification, of any status had a right to go to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.337" offset="1469336">Within a month, a Brownsville legislature... legislator, and Brownsville has a 90-percent Mexican American student population, offered an amendment to a pending bill which resulted in Section 21031.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.958" offset="1515729">Brownsville and the Valley districts are the only districts to have filed amicus briefs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.597" offset="1542374">They have representatives here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.298" offset="1561182">They have also suffered a 700-percent increase in the last year in illegal alien enrollment.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.875" offset="1579468">The purpose of this statute is to protect the Mexican American population's education in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.824" offset="1607262">It is not to discriminate against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.792" offset="1615099">When one looks at the class, and indeed, when one looks at the entire area of equal protection as applied to illegal aliens, the first thing we see is the DeCanas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.364" offset="1669433">Now, admittedly, equal protection was not directly before the Court, but I think several commentators have noticed that the language of the court in talking about the state's interest as well as the rights of illegal aliens in that context are very easily transferrable into equal protection terms, and indeed, when one compares DeCanas with Truax versus Raich, it reaches entirely the opposite result.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.575" offset="1762220">Truax didn't even involve the total denial of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.228" offset="1776849">DeCanas seemingly allows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.041" offset="1788134">At the same time that Truax was decided, the doctrine at that time was that the governments, the state governments could protect their resources from legal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.754" offset="1834945">That has been obviously substantially altered by the decisions of this Court, but the dichotomy between employment in Truax and the government resources in Truax would seem to make our case much stronger here than that of California in DeCanas.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.872" offset="1907461">In determining what class we are looking at, it is interesting to note that the trial court in Texas versus Certain Named and Unnamed Undocumented Alien Children defined the class to be all children who are or will be excluded from Texas schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.785" offset="1991053">He thus included in that class numerous, in fact, who knows how many... we feel that it may be a disastrous number in the future... children that lived... were currently and are currently living in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.108" offset="2052389">The effect of the lower court's decision is that all they have to do is cross the border, and this is not a border like going through customs, when you come into the United States on an airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.540" offset="2090109">This is a border that is very easily walked across, and all you have to do is walk in and you will have your rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.524" offset="2410057">Our problems stem from the fact that all parties agree that about 90 percent of the illegal aliens in this country don't bring their families, but with Mexico so close to Texas, and with Mexico's situation as we see it deteriorating, we are very much afraid that cases like this involving the right particularly to education, which is... we agree wholeheartedly that education is extremely important, important to our residents as well, and we feel like that the trend may well be reversed in Texas, that in fact many more may bring their children in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.053" offset="13368111">With respect to the residency situation, I think it is highlighted by the fact that the plaintiffs in the Doe trial have been here for a number of years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.587" offset="13642292">Indeed, undocumented children are like other children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.322" offset="13649189">Some, like the Doe children, have been here for 15 years, have no English language problems, have no particular problems whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.130" offset="13688477">Others are new immigrants, and as the testimony shows, like new immigrants, like all new immigrants, they may have language needs, may have various other needs, but indeed, to fence out a class of undocumented children is to fence out a class of children.</text>

            <text syncTime="5157.193" offset="20628689">I would like to address the point you asked about the innocent children, and I would like to point out that in Dandridge, in Lalli, in Matthews versus Lucas, all of those cases affected the right of children on the basis of the parents' conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.436" offset="20701727">In fact, this case is much less reprehensible, if you want to use that term, than those, because here the parents' conduct is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.059" offset="20728163">The parents are free to effect the conduct in question at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.291" offset="20745091">They were not free in Lalli once they were deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.228" offset="20760869">They were not free once they were deceased in Matthews versus Lucas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.413" offset="20773616">It is clear... and indeed, if you take the innocent children line of reasoning, all children are a suspect class or heightened scrutiny for purposes of residency, whether they be illegal aliens or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.924" offset="20819696">Our society is somewhat based on the control of parents over children, and that differentiates it from trying to control the acts of parents as to themselves with the illegitimacy through restriction on their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.966" offset="20867762">The other thing that has come up is domicile versus residency, and the reason that has been somewhat confused is, Texas does not require strict domicile to go to school.</text>

            <text syncTime="5230.008" offset="20920007">We require sort of quasi-domicile, and I think that we call it residence under the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.020" offset="20951980">It has been interpreted by our courts, and there are several decisions on this point, that it is not as much as domicile, but it is more than simply staying overnight, you know.</text>
