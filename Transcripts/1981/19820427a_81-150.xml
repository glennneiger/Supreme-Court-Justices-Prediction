            <text syncTime="83.294" offset="333113">At issue on this case is the constitutionality of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978, which represents Congress' most comprehensive effort in this century and perhaps in history to deal with bankruptcies.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.574" offset="386194">The problems that Congress identified were serious including an increase in the number of annual filings from 10,000 a year to over 254,000 a year in a period of only three decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.308" offset="441156">One of the most serious impediments to an efficient bankruptcy system, the Congress found was the court's -- that was the court system, and particularly the confusing distinction between summary and plenary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.256" offset="489012">The 1978 Act creates a Bankruptcy Act in each district as an adjunct to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.038" offset="520150">Judges of the new bankruptcy courts are to be appointed to 14-year terms by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.244" offset="552960">They may be removed by the “judicial council of the circuit” for “incompetence, misconduct, or disability” and they have plenary jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.345" offset="1197349">The first is that the -- that it does include a number of possible types of actions that the bankruptcy judge can entertain, gets right to the heart of the fundamental problem that Congress identified as the serious impediment to an efficient and a fairer bankruptcy system.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.963" offset="1415837">And ignore the many people or someone present by what habeas corpus had to do with bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.630" offset="1446452">But if the issue was raised there, could a court declare that section, the habeas corpus jurisdiction violated the constitution without damaging the rest of the Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="373.817" stopTime="547.212">
            <label>Mr. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="373.817" offset="1495249">I would think clearly so and I would think also that there are other means available ultimately to this Court and indeed short of this Court that would be less severe such as the doctrine of abstention is applicable in the case of the bankruptcy courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.627" offset="1574452">It may of the three evidence of appeal eventually leads to Article III determination and ultimately, therefore to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.038" offset="1612069">I realized that there is a parade of horribles that has been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.510" offset="1629936">The reason that it has been suggested is that the distinction between plenary and summary jurisdiction led to a circumstance in which so many times in the complicated bankruptcy cases and sometimes in the noncomplicated ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.725" offset="1686883">All of the assets of the bankrupt were being consumed by litigating this subject of whether it was summary or was plenary.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.784" offset="1727112">The bankrupt could have his -- his assets -- his assets distributed and could be declared a bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.212" offset="1764833">But in the event that he had a claim that needed to be satisfied, or in the event that the claim needed be satisfied against the bankrupt, that could not be handled by the particular court.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.053" offset="1812167">And that's the problem that Congress attempted to satisfy.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.471" offset="1821884">Now the theory is, as it has been suggested here, that this could lead to a rather broad range of potential types of lawsuits that would traditionally be handled by Article III Courts that could -- out of the statute, be handled by the Article I court.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.981" offset="1891892">The first answer to that is, but that is the very type of problem that Congress saw as the most serious problem under that that was precluding an efficient bankruptcy system.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.815" offset="1943197">Now it may be that in some other case, it will be a sufficient case of the Article I tail weighing the Article III dog that there might be either some administrative problems or prudential problems or even some problems that would rise at the level of constitutionality, but that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.113" offset="2048418">This case lies right at the core of the very problem that everyone agreed Congress needed to take care of where the bankrupt had a claim against someone else and in the process of this reorganization petition needed to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.145" offset="2112575">So that to the extent that there are constitutional problems raised by the parade of horribles, that's for another case and indeed I suspect that is the case with the continuing interpretation of many complex statutes, it will be arrived at short of a determination of constitutionality.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.002" offset="2363977">Now concededly, those were by -- those were true adjuncts to the Article III court in those days and that's my fullest answer to that proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.678" offset="2426671">Our rejoinder to it is that in the Schumacher versus Beeler case, the court in talking about this consent jurisdiction to do -- to decide those kinds of cases referred -- and I'm quoting from page 374.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.991" offset="2507964">The Court said, “The Congress by virtue of its constitutional authority over bankruptcies could confer or withhold jurisdiction to entertain such suits which at least by way of victim says that this Court can do that very thing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="640.822" offset="2563239">But the big point, Justice Stevens, in my view is this; it is beyond dispute that this Court has held in a number of contexts in the past that Article III does not exhaust the Congress's path or to establish courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.230" offset="2632829">And the mere fact that there is no precedent for this one, no square precedent for it, should not be that surprising because there was no press -- square precedent for Palmore or for Bakelite or for Crowell versus Benson.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.426" offset="2689672">The control that is imposed on Congress's power to establish the courts other than under Article III is the control that was articulated in Palmore versus the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.701" offset="2846720">There -- there are the two different views.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.123" offset="2856438">But I submit that if the Court in Palmore had meant specialized -- had meant specialized area to mean federal real estate, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.064" offset="2892173">Usually when this Court refers to enclaves it does not refer to the means of specialized areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.236" offset="2916937">And even more important, when you look at the whole concept of Congress's power to create non-Article III courts, it does tie back to the fact that some subject matters, some subject areas by their nature do require specialized courts and bankruptcy is one of those for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.043" offset="2996140">The first reason is that if you look at that list, 17 powers, 17 clauses that consists -- that constitute Article I Section 8 of all of them, there is none that is linked quite so directly to the resolution of private disputes as does bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.490" offset="3397904">I think that -- that whatever -- that either under Article III or Article I, there is a certain responsibility when it comes to -- when it comes to deciding matters of that -- of that magnitude that they must be construed as -- with a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.088" offset="3488287">And indeed, if you look at the history of bankruptcy in this country, there -- there has been about a two century experiment with how to do it best.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.450" offset="3537711">Almost from the beginnings of our republic, in 1800, the first bankruptcy statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.638" offset="3558504">And from then until 1841, bankruptcy actions were strictly involuntary and retaliatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.436" offset="3581701">They could only be used against the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.131" offset="3592464">The 1841 change provided for voluntary proceedings and then in 1898, it was the last major change when Congress brought them into existence, the referee system with power to exercise summary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.956" offset="3651814">The one constant feature over almost two centuries of bankruptcy had is that this is a field that has been separate and specialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.724" offset="3694864">It has never been anything but separate and specialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.295" offset="3713149">And therefore, Justice O'Connor, I conclude for this reason, plus the fact that bankruptcy itself really almost by definition anticipates the resolution of private controversies, these above all case -- this is above all other areas is a specialized area.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.656" offset="3994540">One final point with respect to Palmore, to the extent that there are any distinctions between Palmore in this case, they cut in favor of the constitutionality of the 1978 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.280" offset="4041038">One is that -- one of the distinctions is that this case does involve bankruptcy, which is I say does anticipate the resolution of conflicting private claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.765" offset="4083043">And the second is, that this case, that Palmore involved a criminal prosecution and this case involves bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.626" offset="4118465">In terms of relevant constitutional values, if there is to be a distinction between criminal prosecutions on the one hand and bankruptcy on the other, certainly, there is a greater need for the protection of the more independent Article III judge where the interest at stake affect life and liberty as well as property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.865" offset="4403409">I'd like to address the issue more in terms of not bankruptcy but the question of whether we're dealing with an Article III court as opposed to an Article I or a legislative court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.978" offset="4463909">And in that regard, and I think this is -- obviously, the Solicitor's position, it's our view that we're dealing with the properly constituted legislative court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.937" offset="4511660">Now, early in this argument, Justice Rehnquist asked, I believe, what the limits were on Congress for the creation of legislative courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.532" offset="5206100">The -- the point that I think is important to recognize here is that when we talk about Canter, when we talk about Palmore, when we talk about the territories, we're talking about something that's rather anomalous if we -- if we reflect on it for a moment is -- and I think the anomaly arises out of the fact that people tend to think of the Article III judicial requirements only in terms of what's been referred to in the briefs here as federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.182" offset="5404630">But Article III is something more than federalism, it's a guarantee to the citizens of this country whether they're citizens of a state or of a territory that in certain circumstances, i.e. a case falling within the federal judicial power, they're entitled to a federal judge enjoying Article III protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.627" offset="5530436">Now, given that set of circumstances and certainly Marshall understood that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.702" offset="5558753">When he decided Canter, he had no trouble at all saying, “However, if it's a valid Article I exercise, we need not have an Article III judiciary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.579" offset="5638269">Now, I think that's important because I think there's a tendency to say, “Well, we're only talking about the territories and who cares about those folks?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.247" offset="13324957">Mr. Orenstein spoke of Article III values.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.930" offset="13343660">There are two constitutional values that are implicated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.735" offset="13358916">They come from two sources, Article I and Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.391" offset="13377515">Both are part of the Constitution and both must be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.471" offset="13397786">On the Article I side, Congress has a responsibility to establish uniform laws of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.746" offset="13430909">This Court has clarified in several opinions in (Inaudible) and Palmore among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.780" offset="13455047">That Congress is entitled to particular deference than there is evidence that Congress actually analyzed the constitutional issue and did its best to resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.911" offset="13499559">The legislative history leaves no doubt that Congress would have enacted the 1978 Act had before the Palmore standards and did its best to apply them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.173" offset="13540624">Those standards by their very definition, specialization of the area, particularization of the need and distinctiveness of the appropriate treatment are the kind of thing that lend themselves best, congressional factfinding and decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.427" offset="13601646">On the Article III side, it is frankly difficult to see what damage if any has been done by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.120" offset="13628395">I have been puzzled throughout my entire consideration of this case and frankly I was puzzled during Mr. Orenstein's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.951" offset="13651801">I am not certain whether the opponents of the statute would like it to be more like an Article III court or less like an Article III court.</text>
