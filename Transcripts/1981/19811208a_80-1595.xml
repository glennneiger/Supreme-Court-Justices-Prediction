            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="59.352" offset="370685">Thank you Mr. Justice Brennan, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.662" offset="383851">In March 1963 Thomas Bennett was beaten and stomped to death in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.066" offset="413526">Respondent and a co-defendant were apprehended after emerging from Bennett's home by police officers called to the scene by neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.469" offset="447067">They were covered with Bennett's blood and co-defendant Gordon had just discarded on the street a wallet that was taken from Bennett.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.012" offset="493251">In November 1963, respondent was convicted of first degree murder and of robbery, and sentenced to death by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.352" offset="530659">On his appeal, the case was heard by the en banc D.C. Circuit, which reversed the sentence of death for procedural improprieties, but affirmed the conviction of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.501" offset="583217">After a series of unsuccessful collateral attacks on his conviction and one successful one relating to his sentence, respondent commenced the present proceeding in 1979, nearly 16 years after he had been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.667" offset="643926">The challenge in this proceeding is certain instructions which were given to the jury at his trial on the element of malice, which is one of the elements of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.944" offset="688961">Now, specifically, the instructions that the court of appeals addressed were three.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.674" offset="723965">The first was the instruction given in Sandstrom that a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.875" offset="756775">The court did not rely on this instruction as a ground for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.170" offset="773911">I'm looking at page 27 of the Joint Appendix, and page 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.294" offset="790420">The second part of the malice instruction that was troublesome was the statement that in determining whether a wrongful act is intentionally done and is therefore done with malice aforethought... you should again bear in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.459" offset="843083">Now, it is correct, as the District of Columbia Circuit recognized several years after its decision on Frady's original appeal, that this is an improper statement because it is not necessarily the case that an intentional act is therefore done with malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.468" offset="923122">Similarly, in discussing the significance of the use of a weapon in this case, on page 28 of the Joint Appendix, the district court said</text>
            <text syncTime="206.760" offset="960321">"The law infers or presumes from the use of such weapon, in the absence of explanatory or mitigating circumstances, the existence of the malice essential to culpable homicide. "</text>
            <text syncTime="216.241" offset="998146">That instruction also was disapproved by the District of Columbia Circuit in subsequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.380" offset="1026776">No objection was made by counsel to any of these instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.454" offset="1047047">Mr. Frey, before you leave the specific instructions, do you happen to know whether these instructions were given to the jury in written form?</text>
            <text syncTime="236.967" offset="1081111">Or were they just read orally?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="244.715" stopTime="571.488">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="244.715" offset="1112144">I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.291" offset="1118414">I will come back to the instructions in a moment because there's another point I want to make about them, but first I'd like to summarize for the Court what the court of appeals held in ordering that habeas corpus relief be granted to respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.144" offset="1185810">First it held, citing this Court's opinion in Davis v. United States, that the standard of review of such a claim on collateral attack is plain error under Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.497" offset="1239204">Secondly, it held that if the standard is not plain error, but rather the cause and prejudice standard of Davis and of Wainwright v. Sykes, then that was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.322" offset="1278492">The cause prong satisfied because it would have been futile to object to these instructions because they were standard at the time they were given; the prejudice prong essentially satisfied because of the court's conclusion that it was not clearly harmless error in the circumstances of this case; it might have affected the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.440" offset="1358949">Then the only remaining question in the Court of Appeals' analysis was whether the decisions in which the D.C. Circuit recognized these errors in the standard jury instructions should be applied retroactively, and the court held, relying on Hankerson v. North Carolina, that because they relate to the jury's determination of factual guilt or innocence, they do have to be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.491" offset="1463230">Now, the decision, in our view, incorporates a number of serious errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.442" offset="1482979">To characterize its result, I would say that first, it completely erases the distinction between direct and collateral attack in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.876" offset="1524775">Secondly, it renders the requirements of contemporaneous objection in Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.294" offset="1558420">And it attaches to each new decision altering the Rules of Evidence or the proper form of jury instructions the consequence of invalidating large numbers of prior convictions obtained before the new decision was handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.866" offset="1620696">Before I address the questions that the court of appeals addressed, I'd like to pause for a moment on the question of whether this is a constitutional or a non-constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.502" offset="1667194">This is something of a morass and I'm not sure that I understand it totally, but it is significant because if it's not a constitutional error, then the failure to raise this point on appeal would appear to foreclose the issue under this Court's holding in Sunal v. Large.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.088" offset="1733545">Secondly, if it's not a constitutional error, while that does not absolutely foreclose relief under 2255, the standard announced in Davis two is that you must have a fundamental defect inherently resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.581" offset="1807524">Now, that standard, it seems to me, must be different from the harmless error standard that the court of appeals effectively applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.311" offset="1842528">Indeed, if the error is non-constitutional, it seems to me that the decision of the court of appeals, recognizing the error, is not significantly different from a statute that would be passed by Congress to correct what it viewed as an improper jury instruction, and I don't think anybody could seriously contend that if Congress had passed a statute in 1967, that Frady would be able to come in and invoke that statute as grounds for collateral relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.410" offset="1946913">Now, I think the error here was not of constitutional magnitude, and in this connection it seems to me that the important case is Sandstrom, but what is instructive is the contrast between Sandstrom and the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.717" offset="2008144">In Sandstrom, the issue was whether the defendant, who admitted killing the victim, had intended to kill the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.025" offset="2053284">And the principal difficulty that the court found in the instruction which was a focal instruction in the case was that it may have caused reasonable jurors to believe that if his actions were such as would be likely to bring about death, then they must find Sandstrom guilty, no matter what they felt about his own state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.454" offset="2143041">Now, many of the cases of this court, Cupp v. Naughten, Henerson v. Kibbe, United States v. Park, in discussing instructions, enjoin the examination of the instruction in the entire context.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.807" offset="2204481">And without going into it in detail here, there was a fairly lengthy instruction on malice, and this instruction required the jury to find that there was a feeling of hatred or ill will on the part of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.592" offset="2303642">State of mind showing a hard regardless of social duty, a mind deliberately bent on mischief and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.137" offset="2329764">And in giving the Sandstrom instruction about the presumption that one intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts, the judge went on to say if a man uses upon another an instrument of such a nature and in such a way and under such circumstances that such use would naturally and probably result in death, then you are not compelled to presume that he intended to kill from such acts, but has the right--</text>

            <text syncTime="589.839" offset="2492559">--No, we didn't list that as a question, but I do think it is material to the Court's consideration of whether the failure to object at trial and to raise the issue on appeal, which is a question that we did present, should bar review.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.304" offset="2546476">But let me move on to the question, if I may, of whether plain error is the proper standard for review in a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.190" offset="2585973">I think the court has made several fundamental mistakes in reaching this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.202" offset="2610006">The first is that it has turned the Davis case topsy-turvy, because what Davis said is that--</text>

            <text syncTime="758.725" offset="3168086">The reason I come back to this point is that in the prior case, one of the arguments that was made is that the Wainwright standard simply doesn't apply if the error is sufficiently grave.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="772.125" offset="3221689">Well, what the court held below was that Davis dictated the plain error standard in the federal context, because Davis said that you would have no more liberal access to collateral review than you would have to review on direct appeal in the case of a procedural default, and the court took that as a holding that you would have equal access to collateral review or to direct review.</text>

            <text syncTime="884.832" offset="3672562">Even if it's regarded as a continuation of the criminal case, a kind of retrospective look at the case, the question is what are the appropriate standards to apply in making that look.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.469" offset="3715090">And I would make the point that the cause and prejudice standard seems to me to be responsive to the issue that's presented as to whether a procedural default should or should not foreclose a claim on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.791" offset="3772350">Because it asks what are the state's interests in enforcing a default, and what is the defendant's excuse for the default.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.912" offset="3812892">And that seems to me to be the proper inquiry to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.630" offset="3823759">Now, if I can turn to the question then of presumed futility of objection as a proper showing of cause under the cause and prejudice standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.530" offset="3875377">This is the key issue both here and in the previous case, and I think underlying the viewpoint of those who find that futility of objection should be cause is the view that it's not fair to defendants and to their lawyers to expect them to anticipate rulings that are not evident at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.646" offset="3967851">Now, it has a certain superficial appeal, but it does not seem to me to be justified on close analysis, and of course, I remind the court, as counsel for Ohio says, that the consequences of applying it in the collateral attack context can be very grave indeed in terms of the numbers of cases that would be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.748" offset="4044233">Now, proper analysis of this issue seems to me to require consideration of several subissues.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.120" offset="4065757">The first question is what constitutes futility; is it that the trial court would likely reject the objection; is it that you have no prospect of succeeding on appeal; is it that you have no prospect in this court?</text>
            <text syncTime="995.491" offset="4115181">I would say when you're dealing with a federal law or constitutional issue, short of an authoritative holding by this Court it seems to me difficult to characterize any ruling as futile to object to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.907" offset="4172860">The second question is, does it make any difference whether the lawyer in this particular case actually refrained from objecting on account of a judgement that he made regarding futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.698" offset="4219984">There's no evidence that that was the basis for the failure to object in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.134" offset="4241718">And there are two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.150" offset="4249868">One is to do what the court of appeals did and presume that all lawyers who didn't raise this objection did so because they thought it would be futile, in which case many defendants will be getting relief on a purely windfall basis totally unrelated to the actual reason for the default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.003" offset="4313294">Or the alternative is to conduct what will be, I think, a very difficult and taxing inquiry into the lawyer's actual motives in not making an objection to something that was potentially objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.216" offset="4366061">Now let me turn to the next question which is, does it matter whether the lawyer was right or wrong in his decision that it would have been futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.869" offset="4404722">In our view, the respondent should not prevail in either case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.351" offset="4422590">Let me say preliminarily that any assumption that if the court of appeals indulged that respondent's counsel was right in judging that it would have been futile to object seems to me completely unsupportable because the court of appeals, shortly thereafter, in fact observed on its own these errors, and in the course of doing so it noted that it must have been just a slip of tongue by the judge, which surely would have been corrected if he had noted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.932" offset="4544948">Now, if the lawyer's assumption that it would be futile to object was wrong, then it seems to me his mistake is no different from many others that defense lawyers, being human, make during the course of a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.786" offset="4604402">For example, the failure to call a helpful witness, the failure to pursue a line of cross examination that would have been useful, or many other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.001" offset="4641287">Now, the standard for assessing whether such mistakes justify a new trial on collateral relief, I think, is the Sixth Amendment of ineffective assistance of counsel standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.136" offset="4681725">And in response to the question that Justice White asked during the last argument, my view is that it is not, I think, correct to equate a mistake on the part of the lawyer in raising a useful claim with ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.614" offset="4751733">The mistake may be of such a magnitude and may have such a fundamental effect in undermining the defendant's prospects of success at trial and be so prejudicial that in all the circumstances, the court will judge it to be a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.856" offset="4820696">In any event, my point here is simply that a mistaken judgment about the futility of raising an objection is really no different from any other kind of mistake that a defense lawyer can make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.977" offset="4865104">Now, I note in this connection that the contemporaneous objection rule does perform a very important function because by insisting on a contemporaneous objection, you do improve the chance that the error will be avoided or corrected at the trial, that it will not occur.</text>

Sykes it's perhaps elaborated on, but it expresses more a feeling or mood rather than any precise standard or any measurable thing as if it were dealing with mathematical equations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.938" offset="5249000">--But I think it does express a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.687" offset="5263942">It doesn't explain what cause means and what prejudice means, but it certainly reflects a policy which this Court has adopted, that there has to be an excuse for a procedural default before the habeas corpus defendant will be allowed to come in and seek relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.650" offset="5327785">He has to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.913" offset="5332905">That's what we're talking about now; is what constitutes this sufficient justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.225" offset="5354117">And I have indicated that in my view, a mistaken belief that it would be futile to object cannot possible be a sufficient justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.845" offset="5392569">So let's now turn to the perhaps more difficult question; that is, assuming that the lawyer is right in his view that that objection would be futile, whatever is necessary to satisfy that... let's say the situation in Sunal v. Large where the appellate Second Circuit had definitively rejected claims by other defendants, and this Court had denied certiorari on those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.774" offset="5492357">So let us say, if it can ever be said, that the lawyer is correct in assuming futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.254" offset="5522241">Nevertheless, substantial reasons exist for enforcing the procedural default and for not treating this accurate assessment of futility as cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.157" offset="5557872">First of all, I come back to the consequences of a rule that does treat it as cause whenever you have a change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.794" offset="5596428">Whenever you have a change in the law with regard to a proper instruction, with regard to a commonly occurring evidentiary ruling, with regard to any of the things that may come up at trial with some frequency, the effect of saying that the lawyer couldn't have known that the law would change and therefore, everybody who had this issue treated adversely to them in their trial is entitled to collateral relief is quite substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.093" offset="5721607">And that, I think, was the point of footnote 8 in Hankerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.326" offset="5734564">It was an effort to confine this effect, while still recognizing the retroactivity that people who had felt the claim was important enough that they were going to raise it and try to insist upon it and try to get it litigated, the court felt it was not fair to deprive them of the benefit, but the people who didn't, this was a limiting principle that I think makes a lot of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.597" offset="5835606">Secondly, if you are going to say that there is no penalty attached to the default, that if a lawyer looks at a particular issue that he might raise and says there's no point in my raising it, therefore I won't, and if it's all right for him to say that and he has full access to collateral attack when somebody else does raise it and does prevail, you've removed the incentives to counsel for raising claims that may bring about improvements in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.602" offset="5951589">In fact, if somebody who raised it, as in Davis two, and lost... if somebody who raised it and lost might be foreclosed on the ground of law of the case, but somebody who didn't raise it would have access to collateral relief, you would actually have created some disincentives to raising claims like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.937" offset="6032987">Another point about the contemporaneous objection rule and the reliance on the default as a ground for foreclosing access to collateral relief, is that a contemporaneous objection is one of the best ways we have of judging whether the issue was important to the defense in the context of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.148" offset="6113862">It seems to me that the court cannot indulge the assumption that every potential issue that was in a case on which the law at some time in the future changes, indulge the assumption that that was important to the defendant and justifies giving him collateral relief, even though he didn't say a peep about it at trial and he didn't raise it on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.171" offset="6193901">Now, if I can sum up, the issue here is a balance between the interests of our system in finality in criminal cases against the concern in our system that substantial injustice not be done, that innocent defendants not be incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.178" offset="6277911">These are important values, and obviously, we don't insist on the same degree of finality in criminal cases that we do in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.033" offset="6313333">Nevertheless, it does remain of significant value in our system and the court has often recognized it, and it's not to be overridden lightly, but only when there are compelling justifications for such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.809" offset="6364428">This is so even when the defendant and his attorney are not at all blameworthy with respect to some error at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.228" offset="6402149">And I think I can best illustrate this point for you by reference to the treatment of motions for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.115" offset="6441646">If you have newly discovered evidence which raises some question about the defendant's guilt; that is, it might have affected the outcome of the trial, there are two points to notice about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.406" offset="6490861">First of all, if the lawyer did not exercise due diligence in discovering this evidence, even though the client is in no way to blame for this, relief of new trial is foreclosed for the lack of due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.854" offset="6544673">This is to ensure that the trial itself is the main event, as the court said in Wainwright, and not a tryout on the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.819" offset="6572468">That is analogous to the lawyer who mistakenly thinks that an objection would be futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.863" offset="6608726">Now, even where the newly discovered evidence could not have been found in the exercise of due diligence, and the defendant and his lawyer are therefore in no way to be blamed, the witness comes back from Tibet and suddenly discloses information, we don't apply a standard like the court of appeals applied in this case that if it might have affected the trial; the standard that is applied is that it would have to probably have resulted in an acquittal before a new trial is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.664" offset="6727844">Now, this may seem harsh, but it is the accommodation that our system makes between two competing important interests; the interest in finality and the interest in not incarcerating innocent defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.971" offset="6785104">If the Court accepts the reasoning of the D.C. Circuit in this case, there is no balance struck between those interests; there is no value afforded to finality in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.434" offset="6834946">There is nothing but a harmless error inquiry in every case when a defendant comes up with some new principle or some new fact which he can call to the Court's attention years and years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.087" offset="6877578">I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal if there are no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.358" offset="11806675">On en banc review there was quite blistering dissent by other members, but the net result was that the court of appeals as a whole sustained the judgment of the panel, that there was sufficient doubt as to the evidence of malice to render multiple instruction errors on that issue sufficiently prejudicial to warrant relief in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.353" offset="12318675">And that was the basis for the holdings in Green and Wharton, and Green and Wharton were the cases that the Frady court relied upon in granting relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.584" offset="12355560">The question that the government raises in their petition asks this Court to hold that a procedural default did occur, though District of Columbia law says one did not, and that the issue is absolutely waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.727" offset="12804135">So if we have a situation where failure to object at trial merely changes the standard of review to plain error, and failure to appeal does not change the standard of review at all, how can the government leap to the conclusion the failure to raise the instruction error at trial somehow triggers the cause and prejudice standard when the issue is first raised on collateral attack?</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.479" offset="12931194">Where the court came to that conclusion in previous decision was from the express provisions of Rule 12 in the Davis case, which expressly applied the standard of cause and prejudice to the error raised there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.519" offset="13003292">And the court extended that principle in Wainwright v. Sykes and Francis v. Henderson where the state courts had held a procedural default to have existed, and held the claim absolutely barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.198" offset="13426058">It is clear that the analysis that the court of appeals needed to go through was to say all right, there appear to have been two procedural failings; one, a failure to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.957" offset="13497111">Does that affect the standard of review?</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.314" offset="13534518">There was a failure to object at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.220" offset="13542146">Well, what's the consequence of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.673" offset="13547893">Well, 52(b) says the consequence of that is to change the standard of review to plain error and analyzing the case under that standard, the court of appeals granted relief and properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.620" offset="13595749">In summation, I do maintain that since District of Columbia law affords relief here, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals rests on an adequate independent ground of local law and must be affirmed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.474" offset="13655100">But second, even if this Court reaches the question that the government has raised in its petition, the application of the cause and prejudice standard here is entirely inappropriate since the application of that standard is premised on a finding of a procedural default which normally bars the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.231" offset="13746110">And since that is not the case with instructional errors, it would be inappropriate for the Court to extend Davis, Wainwright v. Sykes and Francis v. Henderson to this kind of instructional error, which the Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.473" offset="13811103">Although the cases, the D.C. cases, allowing collateral attack for plain error as a matter of local law, which you cite in your brief, do certainly support that proposition, the way they state the plain error standard in the quote on page 9 of your brief is under the plain error standard apparently in the District,</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.575" offset="13883514">"the error complained of must be so clearly prejudicial to substantial rights as to jeopardize the very fairness and integrity of the trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.713" offset="13916115">Now, when you state it that way, it's pretty much like the 2255 standard, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.661" offset="13955926">I would note that the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Frady decision invoked that very standard and held that on the facts of this case, these instructional errors created a probability of a miscarriage of justice because they meant that Mr. Frady may have been improperly convicted of murder when he was only guilty of manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.982" offset="14045160">Now, this was the point that I was discussing previously; there is division of opinion among the judges as to whether in fact the evidence in this case on the question of malice is such that there was sufficient prejudice to warrant relief under that kind of a miscarriage of justice standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.442" offset="14114959">That is a question which is nicely balanced among the judges, and under the Fisher case should not be disturbed by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.827" offset="14172533">Let me start off by putting out to Mr. Justice Stevens that the case that you were looking at was a direct review case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.466" offset="14199073">We have addressed this question of local law, which I think is a complete red herring, in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.634" offset="14227808">Let me just say that first of all, there is nothing in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case that remotely suggests that they would apply a different rule if this case had arisen as a result of a murder on the Capitol grounds or some other federal enclave in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.065" offset="14289457">Secondly, there is nothing in the decisions of the local courts that remotely suggests that they would excuse a procedural default on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.342" offset="14330626">What there is are decisions are saying that they are going to strictly enforce procedural defaults on direct appeal, and only consider under the plain error standard a very limited category of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.511" offset="14375243">It is difficult, I think impossible, to convert that into an understanding that they would be very liberal with such claims on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.178" offset="14409934">Now, with regard to the question that Mr. Justice Brennan asked whether this is like an adequate state ground claim, it is not like an adequate state ground claim because the District of Columbia courts are not state courts, and in fact, the United States Supreme Court is the highest expositor of District of Columbia law, even local law questions, as I learned somewhat to my chagrin in the Whalen case a few years ago--</text>
