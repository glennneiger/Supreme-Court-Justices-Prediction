            <text syncTime="80.702" offset="444564">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.483" offset="447699">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Petitioner is here today because the court of appeals for the Second Circuit held that his employment discrimination claim under Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had to be dismissed by the district court without any consideration of the merits of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.628" offset="548218">The only reason for the dismissal of the federal Title 7 action was that Petitioner had unsuccessfully sought relief for the same alleged discriminatory conduct under the New York state law that bans discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.386" offset="631287">The decision of the court of appeals is wrong because Congress intended to permit Title 7 plaintiffs to pursue their remedies under state law fully without losing the right to a de novo hearing of their claims in federal court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="144.644" offset="700355">Do you contend that Title 7 was an implied repeal of Section 1738, the full faith and credit statute?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="159.825" offset="761064">Well, let's address them in those terms for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.465" offset="775588">Do you contend it was or wasn't?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="165.386" stopTime="187.815">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="165.386" offset="783320">Well, the entire statutory scheme of Title 7 presupposes a system in which there is first a state proceeding, then a proceeding before the EEOC, then a proceeding in federal court, and I think what Congress intended was that all three of those steps should be given their full force and effect.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="187.815" stopTime="199.967">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="187.815" offset="872972">Well, certainly, but the full force and effect of the review by the appellate division in New York would not be given full effect if your contention prevails, would it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="199.967" stopTime="307.000">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="199.967" offset="921560">Your Honor, I disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.105" offset="938174">The appellate division decided a question of state law, first of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.182" offset="958445">It didn't address Petitioner's Title 7 claims as such, but that is really beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.710" offset="988538">I think the basic point is that Congress intended in Title 7 to set up a statutory scheme that had a certain duplication, a certain overlapping of remedies, and that intent is clear, and it has been recognized by this Court in numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.999" offset="1057710">Petitioner was discharged by Respondent, Chemical Construction, from his job as a chemical engineer, and he was denied re-employment on several occasions, allegedly on the basis of his religion and national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.618" offset="1128241">Petitioner first filed his complaint with the EEOC, but the EEOC could not act immediately on the charge, because Section 706(d) of Title 7 requires it to refer the charge to the New York State Division of Human Rights for processing under the state human rights law.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.826" offset="1221028">The Human Rights Division eventually dismissed the charge because it said that there was not probable cause to believe it was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.166" offset="1258435">That state agency decision is the only consideration that any government body, state or federal, administrative or judicial, has ever given to the merits of Petitioner's claim of employment discrimination, yet the Human Rights Division dismissed Petitioner's claim without ever holding any formal hearing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="307.000" stopTime="317.466">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="307.000" offset="1349759">Counsel, I suppose that a formal hearing could have been held had the Petitioner requested it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="317.466" stopTime="372.365">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="317.466" offset="1391659">No, that is not quite right, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.807" offset="1409005">It is the Human Rights Division that decides whether or not there is probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.274" offset="1430843">Only if it decides there is probable cause is a hearing then held.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.257" offset="1450801">So it is not a question of the Petitioner requesting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.084" offset="1466056">As Petitioner was entitled to do under state law, he appealed the dismissal of his complaint both to an administrative appeal board and to the appellate division of the Supreme Court, and I think it is important in further response to you, Justice Rehnquist, that the state legislature found it necessary to provide that step, additional step of judicial review as part of the state process that it enacted to deal with employment discrimination claims.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="372.365" stopTime="376.160">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="372.365" offset="1611193">Why do you think it is helpful?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="376.160" stopTime="431.171">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="376.160" offset="1626344">I think it is helpful, Your Honor, because, as this Court recognized last year in Gaslight Club against Carey, the state procedure is really the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.328" offset="1675036">It is an integrated procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.171" offset="1682455">It is a whole, and the resort to state court, and of course the state court only hears the claim under an arbitrary and capricious administrative review standard, that resort to state court is properly viewed simply as an additional step in the state administrative process, a final step if you will, and I understand that it is a court, not a judicial body, but nevertheless, it is something that is part of the state system to which Congress intended, indeed, the state system as such required resort to initially.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="431.171" stopTime="436.591">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="431.171" offset="1846399">Would your position be different here if the court review was de novo?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="436.591" stopTime="442.166">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="436.591" offset="1868133">Your Honor, that would obviously be a very different case from this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="442.166" stopTime="443.994">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="442.166" offset="1890389">So your answer is yes, it would be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="443.994" stopTime="494.004">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="443.994" offset="1897704">No, I don't think that it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.336" offset="1907108">The reason that I say that is because I think that Congress's intent in enacting Title 7 is what controls in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.566" offset="1943993">Now, as this Court has recognized in several earlier cases, the appropriate thing for a federal court to do in a Title 7 case where there have been prior proceedings, be they state, be they labor arbitration, be they some other form of administrative review, is to give those prior proceedings such weight as the district judge considering all the circumstances of the earlier determination, to give them such weight as the district court finds to be appropriate.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="494.004" stopTime="498.612">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="494.004" offset="2097802">None of those cases involved a state court determination, though, did they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="498.612" stopTime="500.299">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="498.612" offset="2116192">That's correct, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="500.299" stopTime="510.294">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="500.299" offset="2122984">In that regard, Section 1738 really only refers to a state judicial proceeding, does it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="510.294" stopTime="545.124">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="510.294" offset="2162899">It is true that that is what Section 1738 refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.152" offset="2178363">However, the common law and Section 1739, which we mentioned in our reply brief, both make it clear that in general, a state administrative determination of an adjudicatory nature would be equally entitled to full faith and credit, and I think we can see clearly that Congress just didn't intend those general procedural rules to apply to Title 7 cases, because it required resort to those state proceedings.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="545.124" stopTime="572.723">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="545.124" offset="2302288">Going back to the state proceedings in this case, which you addressed a few minutes ago in response to my question, would you say that it is somewhat in the nature of a summary judgment proceeding that at least the petitioner had an opportunity to offer testimony or affidavits or such things to avoid the result that occurred, and simply didn't do it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_a_barrett" startTime="572.723" stopTime="601.618">
            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="572.723" offset="2412629">No, I don't think that that is quite a fair analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.861" offset="2433214">The reason is that, in the federal court, for example, before you get summary judgment... before you can move successfully for summary judgment, you have the opportunity for full discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.325" offset="2483055">There was nothing like that afforded to Petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.823" offset="2497057">We might have deposition evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.978" offset="2513671">He would have a chance to look through Respondent's business records.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="601.618" stopTime="607.193">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="601.618" offset="2528195">Are you saying that he could not have offered such evidence to the state agency?</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="607.193" offset="2550556">I suppose if he could have stolen it, he could have gotten it, but he didn't have any way to get it and put it before the state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.002" offset="2589739">He told them his story.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.656" offset="2596322">Respondent told them its story, or rather, I should say, it told a single investigator who looked into its claim, and Respondent presumably presented the story that was going to benefit it most fully.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="633.885" stopTime="639.993">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="633.885" offset="2657240">But the agency had the power to compel the Respondent to produce records.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="639.993" offset="2681691">If the agency decided that that is what it wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.851" offset="2693184">It is perhaps worth noting that in a report just earlier this year, the New York State Bar Association, a committee of the New York State Bar Association that was composed of equal numbers of representatives of employees and employers reached the conclusion that with respect to both the Human Rights Division and the administrative appeal board, that neither agency has been funded to the degree necessary to enable it satisfactorily to perform its responsibilities under the human rights law.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.946" offset="2837485">I am not saying that that necessarily is what happened in this case, but that is a bit of the flavor of the kind of administrative proceeding that may exist in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.315" offset="2887013">I would also just like to point out that once again, neither the administrative appeal board nor the appellate division had any authority to hold any sort of de novo hearing on Petitioner's claim, and moreover, with respect to his going into state court, the administrative decision that he received from the appeal board told him, and I quote, that he could "obtain judicial review" and that</text>
            <text syncTime="732.034" offset="3049913">"such proceedings shall be brought in the appellate division of the Supreme Court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="736.343" offset="3067153">Now, ultimately both of those state bodies denied relief, and Petitioner finally returned to the EEOC, which, giving, as it must, substantial weight to the state proceedings, also found that there was no reasonable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.450" offset="3243532">It would be the same as I think I told Justice White, that the district court could not dismiss the case out of hand on the basis of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.805" offset="3288985">It could give those proceedings appropriate weight in light of all the factors that you have described, and in such a case it might give them very heavy weight.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.581" offset="3512071">The decision of the court of appeals disrupts the very carefully thought out and very extensively debated statutory scheme that Congress enacted in Title 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.874" offset="3693256">It recognized that Congress considered and rejected proposals to have an administrative agency... there it was the EEOC... exercise what the Court called primary adjudicative responsibility for Title 7 cases, subject only to limited court review, yet the effect of the court of appeals decision is to allow the final resolution of discrimination claims to be made under a state procedural structure that is precisely of the same kind that Congress rejected for application in the federal system, or--</text>

            <text syncTime="936.934" offset="3869531">That was the issue in Chandler, but the '72 amendments as originally proposed would have given the EEOC power to hold hearings in all cases, subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act, but the EEOC would have had primary enforcement responsibility for private cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.504" offset="3959810">Or, to put the argument a little bit differently, as I said earlier, the state legislature apparently believed that it was necessary to have judicial review as part of its state process for remedying discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.853" offset="4045178">The decision below, however, gives the complainants an unacceptable choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.023" offset="4073808">Either they may participate in the state proceedings without invoking the judicial review that the legislature thought was essential as part of that process, or they can forfeit their right to a federal court determination of their claim, a right that, as this Court has recognized a number of times, Congress clearly intended them to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.699" offset="4180492">In short, there is nothing in the language or legislative history of Title 7 that even suggests that Congress intended to make any distinction between state administrative and state judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.692" offset="4248515">It simply intended in Title 7 to allow those states that were concerned with the problem of employment discrimination, and there are now 44, incidentally, that have enacted proceedings to deal with employment discrimination, to remedy the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.935" offset="4321449">It made no effort to dictate the particular form of the state proceedings, and certainly it must have contemplated, for example, because it mentioned criminal proceedings right in the statute, that they would involve court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.959" offset="4389576">Yet it nevertheless set up a system with the EEOC and then the federal courts to hear those claims after the states had acted on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.846" offset="4433148">It makes no sense in the context of such a scheme to cut off the process at the very first step.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.525" offset="4831882">The two aspects of the scheme and policies of Title 7 that I am referring to are, one, that in holding that a judgment of a state court reviewing a state agency's action on a state law claim may have preclusive effect on litigation of federal claims in federal court, the holding below would discourage the full pursuit of state remedies by complainants of employment discrimination, precisely the policy that this Court expressed concern about in its decision in New York Gaslight Club against Carey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.771" offset="5024874">The policy of Title 7 is to encourage the full use and, Congress hoped, the resolution of many employment discrimination claims through available state procedures, and that policy would be frustrated if full pursuit of those procedures would have adverse consequences on the ability to assert the federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.743" offset="5152665">The other aspect of Title 7 that we find irreconcilable with the decision of the court of appeals is that Title 7 itself specifies that the EEOC in conducting its business is to give substantial weight, that it nowhere says anything about preclusive effect, it says substantial weight to the findings of state authorities that have previously been invoked with respect to the same claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.087" offset="5306056">Now, in most instances, to be sure, the EEOC is unlikely to find reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred when there has been an adverse resolution to the complainant in the state proceedings, but there are instances in which, in light of everything presented during its investigation, including the evidence of the state proceedings, the Commission in giving those the substantial weight Congress prescribes, the Commission concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the federal statute has occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.536" offset="5499885">Supposing we are talking about security, and the plaintiff has a state securities case, it goes all the way up through the state court system, loses, then he brings an action under 10(b)(5) in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.672" offset="5556414">Now, there is nothing in any of the federal securities law that says the federal court has to give any sort of weight to the state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.430" offset="5611480">Would you say that 1738 didn't apply there?</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.316" offset="5678980">If one looks at 1738, all it says is that the judicial proceedings of any court of any state shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States and its territories as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.557" offset="5759960">All that the state court decided in this case was that the state administrative agency did not act arbitrarily or capriciously or abuse its discretion or make a procedural error under state law in dismissing the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1434.454" offset="5859539">Well, that would be a different question, and I believe that the scheme of Title 7 would not give preclusive effect to that, although weight would be given to it, but if I may finish my thought here, there is no attempt to re-examine in the federal court whether an error was made by the state administrative agency in dismissing a complaint under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.535" offset="5975836">The other aspect of the New York scheme is that if one asserts this administrative remedy, then it cannot resort to any other remedy under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.310" offset="6026931">There is no attempt being made in federal court to resort to any other remedy under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.840" offset="6049083">It is entirely speculative to think that the New York courts would give this judgment any preclusive effect in a Title 7 suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.711" offset="6096626">Our position, as we stated in the Court last term, is that the New York courts don't have jurisdiction to entertain Title 7 suits, and the question would never even arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.441" offset="6143542">In any event, neither the agency nor the reviewing court had any authority under New York law to consider a Title 7 case in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.066" offset="7374014">It centers on a judgment of the New York appellate division, first department, one of that state's second highest appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.624" offset="7412257">In light of what has been said here earlier, I must emphasize that this was a final judgment in the state of New York, and its finality emanates from a legislative act, New York Executive Law Section 298, which reads as follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.143" offset="7538272">We don't think that 1739 is in the remotest way relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.470" offset="7551646">1739 is a statute which merely deals with the books and records such as birth certificate entries, driver's license entries in one state and another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.542" offset="7603891">It does not deal and purport to deal with the preclusive effect of administrative agency determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.963" offset="7625625">Secondarily, we believe Title 7, properly read, specifically intended not to give preclusive effect to state agency determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.663" offset="7660420">That is exactly what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.755" offset="7668779">What is missed here is the fact that this was a judgment of a court, and I believe that Section 1738, under traditional doctrines of claim preclusion which have been enforced by this Court for at least 200 years, is the proper guide here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.419" offset="7751431">The question follows thereafter as to whether Title 7, in 1964 and 1972, repealed in any manner the pre-existing judicial and statutory circumstances, and it is our belief that without even reaching the doctrine of repeal, that these two statutes are read together easily and there is no difficulty because the position asserted by Petitioner and the government is fundamentally incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.544" offset="7903882">Title 7 and its language, as Justice White correctly indicated, used the language, "state and local authorities".</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.509" offset="7939826">Beyond that, in the statute itself, "state and local agencies" are used interchangeably with "state and local authorities".</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.941" offset="7985488">Indeed, as recognized by the EEOC, its own regulations, which we have quoted in the supplemental appendix, and I call the Court's attention to Supplemental Appendix Page 59 to 60, this is the EEOC, 29 CFR, deferrals to state and local authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.307" offset="8079006">See 706 agency defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.727" offset="8092695">And these regulations are replete... Year after year EEOC has defined what they think state and local authorities are, and they are agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.536" offset="8139924">The statutory history of the Act refers to state fair employment agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.641" offset="8172316">There is a substantial and a critical difference between an agency and a court, and I would like to call the attention of the Court to its decision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver, which has been cited by Petitioner on its behalf, but I think incorrectly, and with respect, at 415 US 47, there is a critical statement by the Court in Alexander which reads, if I may, as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.270" offset="8294778">"Consistent with this view, Title 7 provides for consideration of employment discrimination claims in several forums. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.547" offset="8327901">and the Court then cites the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.484" offset="8339708">The first is EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.342" offset="8351098">The second is state and local agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.966" offset="8365622">The third is federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.433" offset="8379519">It then says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.635" offset="8388296">"and in general, submission of a claim to one forum does not preclude a later submission to another. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.569" offset="8415986">and its footnote clearly indicates by that it meant that Commission action is not barred by findings and orders of state or local agencies, and then it calls attention to McDonald-Douglas v. Green, which holds that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.311" offset="8491010">The mere fact that the EEOC did not find probable cause is no bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.403" offset="8515356">Congress, as recognized by this Court, was understanding that there were three forums involved, the EEOC, state and local agencies, and then the federal court, and none of the decisions of this Court read against that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.176" offset="11710445">I think the answer is the answer I gave to Justice Stevens, which is that on the 61st day a claimant would then... he could enter the federal district court.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="3040.962" offset="12285557">Just very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.585" offset="12300081">First of all, with respect to Justice Stevens' question concerning Section 1739, if you look at the operative language of 1738 and 1739, it is identical for all practical purposes, and of course both of those statutes date from the very earliest days of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.747" offset="12384717">They are very general procedural statutes, like the venue statute, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.965" offset="12405615">And in a specific enactment to deal with a relatively limited and specific problem such as employment discrimination, enacted in 1964, amended in 1972, Congress simply acted under the supremacy clause to specify the weight that was to be given to state proceedings that preceded a Title 7 proceeding in the EEOC or in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.374" offset="12527242">Congress never intended to force a litigant to choose to abandon his federal remedies by proceeding in a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.353" offset="12575202">It wouldn't have set up this cooperative scheme if that is what it intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.304" offset="12606967">Petitioner has been trying for six years to get a hearing on his discrimination claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.800" offset="12632985">He has been thrown out of court not for sleeping on his rights but for pursuing them too diligently in what you might call exhausting state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.513" offset="12679797">if he failed to anticipate that the second circuit would rule as it did in the Sinicropi case, which is the one that we are all concerned with here, he was in good company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.728" offset="12732668">District Judge Pierce in a decision in this very case before Sinicropi was decided held that he was not precluded, and now four other circuits, looking at the legislative history and at this Court's decisions, have reached the same result as Judge Pierce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.579" offset="12812081">That is the proper reading of a remedial statute such as Title 7, and it is the only result that is consistent with the holdings and the spirit of this Court's decision in Alexander, in Chandler and, I think, most particularly, in New York Gaslight Club, where the Court looked at this very same New York procedure, clearly saw that it encompassed judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.599" offset="12936110">And to answer one final point, we don't say that the employer would be barred any more than the claimant would be from litigating in federal court if the claimant elects to pursue his Title 7 action there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.030" offset="12993893">What is fair for one is fair for the other, we think, so I don't think the Court needs to have any concern on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.714" offset="13028584">All we are asking here is for the de novo trial before a federal judge that Congress intended, and we hope that the Court will reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit.</text>
