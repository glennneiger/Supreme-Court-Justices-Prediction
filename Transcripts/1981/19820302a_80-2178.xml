            <label>Mr. Robert A. Zarnoch</label>
            <text syncTime="73.929" offset="435198">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is the second time this case has been here, the second time this Court has been called upon to examine the constitutionality of the University of Maryland's policy of denying in-state benefits to non-immigrant aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.987" offset="487339">The last time this case was here, it was complicated by an unresolved issue of state law and of concerns over the University's basis for treating non-immigrant aliens differently, issues that have caused this case to be certified, the question to be certified to the court of appeals of Maryland, and ultimately the case to be remanded back down to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.150" offset="564034">These questions are now behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.517" offset="573543">This time around, however, the case raises additional and perhaps more significant constitutional questions evidenced, I think, by the fact that for the first time in this Court's history, all 50 states are participating here as amici and unified behind a single position, namely, urging the reversal of the Fourth Circuit's decision and overruling of Vlandis versus Kline.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.847" offset="658806">Of the four constitutional questions raised in this case, the foremost issue, we think, is the question of whether the University's policy denies equal protection to non-immigrant aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.887" offset="703005">We think that if we prevail on this ground, many of the other issues in the case could quickly fall by the wayside.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.691" offset="726202">Now, the equal protection issue here, we think, calls into play the very rationale for labeling certain alien classifications suspect and for according them strict scrutiny, a rationale we say that focuses in on the burdens permanent resident aliens share with citizens, and which non-immigrant aliens as a class conspicuously lack.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.120" offset="807913">Although resident aliens may be saddled with disabilities, we suggest that non-immigrant aliens, on the other hand, are blessed with privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.376" offset="840932">At the outset, it is important to understand what is at stake here, how many persons are affected by the University's policy, and the nature of the disadvantaged class.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.899" offset="879071">First, all we are talking about here is the tuition differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.219" offset="896312">At one time, the University did have a disparate charge with respect to certain fees, for example, dorm fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.973" offset="927345">That is no longer the policy of the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.408" offset="937063">Only in tuition is there a difference with respect to in-state and out-of-state students.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.562" offset="953676">Secondly, we are not talking about scholarships, state scholarships, that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.847" offset="970813">The state of Maryland does not deny state scholarships to non-immigrant aliens as a class, assuming they can show financial need.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.037" offset="1003623">It is also important to note how many people are affected by the University's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.857" offset="1026819">According to the record in this case, during the years 1978 and 1979, there were anywhere from 1,000 to 1,200 permanent resident aliens attending the University of Maryland.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.306" offset="1120651">On the other hand, there are half as many non-immigrant aliens, as few as 497, I believe, in 1978.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.605" offset="3973850">To turn to the supremacy clause for a moment, there are really two separate supremacy clause arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.044" offset="4003629">One was basically premised upon an impermissible state attempt to regulate immigration, and the lower court held the policy invalid on that ground solely because it found an invidious discrimination under the equal protection clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.973" offset="7023384">Contrary to what the Assistant Attorney General said, this is not at all non-immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.027" offset="7051596">This Court's opinion in the Alkins case held specifically that most non-immigrants, and it listed a number of the visa categories, were precluded by the terms of their visas under the federal law from establishing domicile in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.037" offset="7119619">Obviously, these people are not discriminated against by the University's policy, because even if they were treated like citizens and immigrants, they would fail to qualify.</text>

            <text syncTime="2675.145" offset="10839979">Now, let me address the supremacy clause issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.264" offset="10852517">Under this Court's decisions in the cases of Takahashi, Graham against Richardson, DeCanas against Bica, it is established that it is up to the federal government to decide the terms and conditions upon which aliens will be admitted to this country and will reside in this country, and once it has done so, the states may not impose additional discriminatory burdens on them... excuse me... not contemplated by Congress, and they especially may not do so on account of their immigration status assigned by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.055" offset="11007685">Here, Congress has assigned the various classes of immigrants and non-immigrants, and has decided on the restrictions applicable to them, and as this Court held in Flkins, Congress has deliberately decided that the G-4 visa holders and a few other categories are entitled to be domiciled in this country, unlike most non-immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.623" offset="11109980">In this situation, the states may not rely on their immigration status to impose 45 restrictions not imposed on other domiciliaries of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.364" offset="11160867">To do that is to impose on their residents in this country discriminatory burdens not contemplated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.370" offset="11192945">This may be justified, but only in the most exceptional circumstances, such as, for example, where the state is regulating in the area of traditional state sovereignty, defining qualifications for voting or for holding elective offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.296" offset="11252609">There that... there may be a good reason for what the state has done, but nothing like that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.784" offset="11274552">Here, Congress has decided that these non-immigrants can be domiciled here, as a matter of federal immigration law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.889" offset="11307048">And but for their status under the federal immigration law, they would be entitled to these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.376" offset="11332961">In this situation, the state cannot on account of their immigration status deny them the benefits that it grants to all other domiciliaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.601" offset="11377892">That is inconsistent with Congress's decision in admitting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.986" offset="11395342">That is an encroachment on the exclusive federal authority over immigration, and is in violation of the supremacy clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.962" offset="13555250">And if their reliance is on the tax ground, the fact that they don't pay full taxes on the salaries, then that must fall, too, for the 54 same reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="3367.889" offset="13611048">Here, the University's discriminatory treatment of G-4 visa holders who are domiciled in Maryland is inconsistent with the federal judgment that they are entitled both to be domiciled in this country and to have a tax exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.257" offset="13936429">Moreover, the question of whether any of the categories of non-immigrant aliens can be domiciled in Maryland is a question for the Maryland courts to decide, as this Court indicated itself in Elkins versus Moreno the first time this case was here.</text>
