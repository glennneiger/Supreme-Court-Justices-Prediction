            <label>Mr. Edward D. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="21.351" offset="235350">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.491" offset="251860">This case involves the application of the federal railway laws to state-owned and state-operated railroads transporting a heavy volume of interstate freight and transporting as well a heavy volume of passengers, both commuter and non-commuter.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.407" offset="311523">The challenged statute is the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.983" offset="325838">The Railway Labor Act, as evidenced by the numerous decisions in this Court involving it, is a unique statute involving a unique industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.105" offset="362305">It was negotiated some 55 years ago in conferences between the railroad industry and the railway labor organizations induced by President Coolidge at that time, and they worked out in 1926 this statute as the basis for developing a special rule of labor relations for the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.408" offset="459585">The date of enactment was 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.421" offset="471602">The challenging railroad is the Long Island Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.872" offset="485394">The Long Island Railroad is one of the oldest railroads in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.574" offset="504202">It has been subject to federal railway laws from the very inception of the earliest law in 1887, the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.571" offset="540251">The question in the case is whether the State of New York by its act of taking over the business of operating the Long Island through stock purchase from the Penn Central Railroad in 1966 withdrew the railroad from the reach of the commerce clause and therefore from the reach of the Railway Labor Act under the concept set down by this Court in the National League of Cities v. Usery.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.356" offset="651324">The District Court held that New York did not succeed in withdrawing this railroad from the reaches of the commerce clause and of the Railway Labor Act, and in so holding it found that this railroad served as a critical physical link in the movement of a heavy volume of interstate freight with other railroads via the New York City gateway connecting Long Island with the rest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.609" offset="784340">And the District Court concluded that the case was governed by California v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.074" offset="802207">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the action of the state in operating the railroad was a sovereign act within the National League concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.352" offset="843376">It recognized that the Long Island Railroad serves as a crucial link in the movement of interstate freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.568" offset="868245">Nonetheless, it found that the railroad served an important function in moving a heavy volume of commuters between New York and Long Island, and on this basis distinguished the California v. Taylor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.860" offset="925401">Now, when the New York--</text>

            <text syncTime="214.226" offset="1006798">This railroad operates within the State of New York, but it operates well outside of the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.145" offset="1038459">It serves the entire area of Long Island, which is 126 miles long and 23 miles wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.627" offset="1064477">It services the towns in Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.938" offset="1085688">But it's a freight railroad and it's a commuter railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.702" offset="1108780">I'll get to that in just a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.513" offset="1115990">The time for purchase, the railroad, as we have noted in our brief, assured the public and assured the employees of the Long Island Railroad that all it was doing was buying the stock, the railroad remained a private corporation, the employees remained private employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.958" offset="1189760">It said that everything was the same; the only thing that was different was that there was a new set of owners and a new board of directors, but otherwise the operation of the railroad was unchanged; the same people would be pounding the same typewriters and pulling the same switches, and that the railroad employees would remain railroad employees subject to federal railway law, specifically the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.574" offset="1276278">And that's the way it has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.886" offset="1285473">Now, this railroad is the only common carrier by railroad serving Long Island, serving the Nassau and Suffolk County in Long Island, the furthestmost reaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.787" offset="1337091">There's a map of Long Island which I attached to the brief to the sense of the relationship of the trackage in this railroad to the trackage in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.673" offset="1380663">The railroad has something like 325 miles of track radiating throughout the entire length and width of Long Island, serving the Long Island towns.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.275" offset="1475017">The railroad does connect with... its terminal is the Pennsylvania Station in New York City, and it connects with the Pennsylvania Station over the old Penn Central tracks, now the ConRail tracks, over which it has trackage rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.894" offset="1529456">So its tracks connect with the ConRail tracks, and it moves under the East River ConRail tunnel and terminates in Pennsylvania Station.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.636" offset="1596434">The freight is unloaded... it interchanges its interstate freight through ConRail at Long Island yards called Fresh Ponds, Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.038" offset="1646067">It's at that point that the railroad connects with the national railroads throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.645" offset="1664562">The interchange takes place at Fresh Ponds.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.361" offset="1687340">At that point the Long Island Railroad will move the freight cars to various classification yards which it has in Long Island for eventual distribution throughout the Island.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.921" offset="1869571">Well, I think Respondent uses the figure four percent, but in using that figure he's using the subsidies which the state receives, I believe, from the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.183" offset="1902694">If we're looking at revenue, the passenger revenue on the Long Island for the year '78, which is the year on which this record was based, was something in the neighborhood of $126 million, and the freight revenue was in the neighborhood of $20 million, so the ratio is about 6 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.162" offset="1958596">Although the railroad is principally a commuter railroad, it carries a significant amount of interstate freight.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.198" offset="2054726">There are seven of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.042" offset="2058070">And the carriage of freight is a principal part of its operation as far as this area is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.836" offset="2093283">It carried 2 million tons of freight in 1978 on the 41,000 cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.614" offset="2120346">It returned those cars either loaded into the interstate system through ConRail and spread throughout the United States in the connecting carriers, or if it didn't have enough traffic to fill those cars, it had to return those cars unloaded, and those unloaded cars would be returned to the national freight car pool in the United States through the interchange with Conrail.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.777" offset="2213029">The freight revenue is derived largely from divisions, and these divisions are shares of a line haul rate charged by the originating carrier, which may be the Burlington coming out of Washington, it may be a railroad coming out of the middle west.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.800" offset="2289097">It will be deriving its freight from every part of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.002" offset="2301949">Now, its share from the divisions, which is all subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, was about $12 million in 1978 exclusive of surcharges, and the $12 million represented about 18 percent of the line haul revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.417" offset="2379585">The Long Island's share was 18 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.759" offset="2388989">It also added to the divisions something called a surcharge under the Railroad Retirement Act, and that surcharge was 12 1/2 percent flat, which produced another $6 or $7 million in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.157" offset="2458580">The surcharge, as the Respondents point out in their brief, were recently disallowed by the Interstate Commerce Commission as not compatible with the standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.731" offset="2504869">The case involving the surcharge was before this Court on petition of the Long Island Railroad a few years ago in a case called Long Island Railroad v. Aberdeen and Rockfish Railroad in which this Court remanded the case to the Interstate Commerce Commission with directions as to the handling of the refunds on the disallowed surcharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.301" offset="2591177">Long Island at the time of the surcharge proceeding filed an application with the ICC for an increase in the amount of its divisions; it wanted a greater share.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.967" offset="2633809">That was disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.139" offset="2638511">And most recently, following the disallowance, it filed a new set of surcharges in about the same amount as the disallowed surcharges of 12 1/2 percent, and this time its action was taken under the Staggers Rail Deregulation Act of 1981 which allows carriers to file surcharges of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.928" offset="2729626">These surcharges were also challenged by the national railroad, and that proceeding is now pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.221" offset="2758779">Now, in addition to this activity, the railroad carries... it sells 260,000, on this record, commutation and non-commutation tickets.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.581" offset="4140238">And there's one other provision in that act which is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.299" offset="4155076">I should say that the Railway Labor Act is designed to avoid strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.438" offset="4171690">Its whole purpose was to minimize and avoid strikes, and it's been successful in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.421" offset="4191647">The amendments to the commuter act prohibit secondary strikes, which is something new in the railway labor jargon, if the Court remembers the secondaries in the Jacksonville Terminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.680" offset="4252669">But secondary strikes, strikes by the freight service cannot in any way be extended to the commuter service; so it ensures continued operation of the commuter service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.565" offset="4304183">If there's a commuter dispute it goes through this interminable process plus 240 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.203" offset="4326753">Now, California v. Taylor was expressly confirmed in National League of Cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.717" offset="4356846">It was the only example given in footnote 18 of the kind of an activity which is not to be regarded as traditional; and it was at that time said in explanation that the states have never regarded the operation of a railroad in interstate commerce as a traditional activity, and that's the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.458" offset="4435735">New York has attested to this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.660" offset="4444617">It's respected, observed all of the federal railway laws, including the Railway Labor Act, from the time of its purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.000" offset="4485891">It questioned the Railway Labor Act alone and then only on February 8, 1980 in the context of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.795" offset="4509087">And all of the other railroads either owned, or operated, or subsidized in the commuter service or in the freight service or in the terminal service throughout the United States owned, operated or subsidized by states regard those railroads as not sovereign activities but as activities of railroads subject to railroad laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.912" offset="4581603">And so it must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.317" offset="4587246">As Justice Rehnquist noted in Frye v. U. S, if I may paraphrase it, the activity of a state in running a railroad in interstate commerce is so unlike the traditional government activities that it has always been regarded as a part of a nationwide railway system; and that's the fact today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.982" offset="4665822">Long Island Railroad is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.997" offset="4673868">It's the only railroad owned... it's the only freight-commuter railroad owned and operated by a state, carrying the amount of freight and the amount of passengers which it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.164" offset="4714619">So we submit that this case falls well short of satisfying this Court's test of traditionality as explicitly identified in footnote 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.050" offset="4758086">But even apart from the foregoing, as we point out in our brief, we feel that the Respondents have failed to satisfy any of the tests of the National League of Cities; and I'd like to refer explicitly to the intrusion test, the concept being that the federal government may not intrude into the sovereign affairs of the state by interfering or disrupting its processes in which it functions as a state within a national system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.835" offset="4885251">The Railway Labor Act and the railway labor laws have not intruded into the Long Island Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.753" offset="4912940">They were in place in 1887, the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1201.078" offset="4954214">When the State of New York purchased the stock of the Long Island Railroad it knew that this was a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.169" offset="4998622">It knew that the tradition in the other cases... and this was before U.S. v. California, which is a 1936 case... well, this was after the California case, and it was after California v. Taylor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.083" offset="5542282">There are certainly many other indicators of the state's subjective intentions in this respect, and that in itself, as I hope to explain, would not be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.672" offset="5592646">The state chose as a matter of state law to classify the employees of this railroad as not state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.294" offset="5619082">Perhaps that's a public utterance, but we would submit it's an utterance of the most fundamental kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.229" offset="5646877">If the state had taken no action at all, we would think that one would still look to the conduct of the other states and the expectations of states generally, and particularly in this area we would look to this Court's decision in California v. Taylor, which had been decided nine years earlier, in which the state must be bound to have been aware in taking over the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.220" offset="5734857">It is our submission that a state could not by its unilateral action in assuming a function which has long been subject to what we contend is a very core aspect of the commerce power, cannot remove that authority away from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.792" offset="5801104">We see this case as most fundamentally analogous to the Court's decision in Case v. Bowles in which this Court also took the trouble to distinguish rather than overrule in National League of Cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.628" offset="5856483">The Court explained that the power there involved the war power which was the basis on which the Court upheld the emergency price restrictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.356" offset="7207327">I'd like to compare this case with National League of Cities itself to point out a few salient features which we think require distinguishing that case on the assumption that it is the law with which we must contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.395" offset="7279530">The statute at issue in National League of Cities was a very different statute, and the chronology was a very different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.346" offset="7303353">It was very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.956" offset="7309727">And we contend that those are very important factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.876" offset="7321430">In National League of Cities the Court was confronted with some 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.294" offset="7351105">Those amendments eliminated a longstanding immunity for state and local government employees who had been exempted from the coverage of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.370" offset="7387363">The act itself set rigid standards, and the Court focused on the rigidity of those standards, for the wages and hours of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.597" offset="7444310">But as I say, state and local government employees were not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.955" offset="7461760">And that was so starting in 1938 when the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.906" offset="7481509">Congress reversed fields rather sharply in 1974, subjecting what this Court described as almost all public employees employed by the states or various political subdivisions to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.510" offset="7535948">Among the functions covered were police protection, fire prevention, public health, sanitation, parks and recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.396" offset="7575549">And those were activities which the Court described... and I quote again... as</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.770" offset="7592999">"well within the traditional operations of state and local governments. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.253" offset="7606896">This case stands in sharp contrast to National League of Cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.188" offset="7630720">The statute is one of the most narrowly drawn instruments you could imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.640" offset="7648483">It applies to one industry, an industry which the Court has described in California v. Taylor as a state within a state, noting its unique characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.074" offset="7690175">And of course, as has been said, it is in the history which the Court singled out, characterizing in National League of Cities as one not within the realm of protected state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.568" offset="7732180">Another factor which we believe serves to distinguish this case from the National League of Cities is the pervasive and longstanding character of federal regulation of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.671" offset="7800620">It really needs no citation to point out that the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 whose terms determine the applicability of the Railway Labor Act is the seminal exercise of the federal commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.072" offset="7862269">It's really the context in which this Court has defined that power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.642" offset="8088490">Therefore, the state could have no reasonable expectation of freedom from the federal regulation, and it assumed whatever burden that regulation carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.170" offset="8126629">We, of course, contend that was quite a minimal burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.888" offset="8137495">In National League of Cities the states unquestionably got there first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.682" offset="8156617">There is some dispute between the parties as to exactly how long the states had been doing some of those functions, whether police was a public function in the nighttime or the daytime in the City of New York in 1652 or 1852.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.723" offset="8216803">And we could debate the historical points, but we think it's simply unnecessary to get into those areas which may have a shade of gray because it cannot be denied that the federal government pursuant to its core commerce power functions got here a long time before the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.826" offset="8289215">And although I don't think it's necessary, it seems to me a fine point is put on the matter by the fact that the Court had already decided California v. Taylor and had spoken as to what happens in exactly this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.445" offset="8339683">There may well be issues as to how many years is enough to make something traditional, and I think it's probably appropriate to point out that those issues will not likely escape this Court even if they escape decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.470" offset="8399765">There's a lot of discussion both in Respondent's brief and particularly in the briefs of some of the amici curiae about mass transit generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.435" offset="8435709">We, of course, have submitted in our brief that these commuter railroads, because of their history and physical nature, are distinct from mass transit generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.197" offset="8470713">I don't know whether I should telegraph punches to the Justices, but the Justices may wish to note that a District Court in Texas has invalidated provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act as applied to mass transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.347" offset="8531318">The court's direct appeal jurisdiction seems relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.814" offset="8545215">The Solicitor General has not determined yet whether to file a jurisdictional statement, but it has in other litigation been the Government's position that those are not traditional government functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.795" offset="8585130">That case will probably wend its way here, and we urge, particularly because of that fact, that there is no reason to reach out for those issues which we think need not be decided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.713" offset="8628806">We do stress that there are facts in this case which make it susceptible, we think, of a uniquely narrow resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.865" offset="8677394">This is apparently the only commuter railroad that's state owned and also has a freight service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.252" offset="8698919">It's one of two, possibly three commuter railroads that are operated by a state entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.390" offset="8727445">It's generally not a very broad question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.936" offset="8737685">Certainly the state showed by its conduct... that conduct offers exquisite testimony as to what the state's expectations were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.026" offset="8774047">We note that the Respondent has pointed out its possible interest in operating some of the ConRail railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.709" offset="8812813">Of course, one thing that should be obvious is that some of those, one of those at least, runs over into Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.332" offset="8839249">I gather that there's a railroad in the Chicago area, a commuter railroad, that runs over into Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.407" offset="8863595">Truly the Court will be aware of the problems that would be created if those railroads were held to be outside the federal commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.372" offset="8895464">It strikes us that these are precisely the situations that the commerce power was created to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.526" offset="8928065">This is one of the reasons why this United States was created and the Constitution adopted, to eliminate the problems that might arise if Connecticut attempted to apply one system of labor relations and New York another to employees on a road that runs from New Haven to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.191" offset="8994730">Here we're getting back to almost 200-year old conceptions of internal trade barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.766" offset="9020957">We submit that all these things which may sound fanciful illustrate the fundamental commerce power question which is entailed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.246" offset="9062962">There are many reasons why we believe the Court should not abandon the language in National League of Cities which comes, as I understand it, from Mr. Justice Rehnquist's dissent in Frye v. United States, stressing the importance of traditional functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.286" offset="9135060">It seems to us that this is essential, inherent in the Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.112" offset="9158361">As we read not only National League but tax immunity cases, the reason for this immunity is partly because the states were here before there was a United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.405" offset="9195559">But of course, that makes it perfectly appropriate to look to the functions which the states did or at least were akin enough to those functions to be regarded as within the state sovereignty, as distinguished from those functions which were not at all akin to state functions in place in the constitutional period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.553" offset="9276121">We would also note one very practical factor touching on separation of powers concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.816" offset="9297228">We would suggest that if Respondent's alternative test is adopted, Congress would simply have no way of knowing when it enacts a statute which might in the future come to apply to a state instrumentality whether it will remain constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.700" offset="9356682">To adopt the rule that something merely deemed essential pursuant to the political process of a state is within the state sovereignty, by that reason alone statutes will become unconstitutional or not with shifting social and economic considerations; Congress and the lower courts will be left without a compass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.318" offset="9435154">And it seems to us inappropriate to place on Congress by judicial decree what is essentially a sunset requirement; that Congress be faced with the requirement of going through each of its enactments on a periodic basis and determining whether or not changing conditions had made them unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.808" offset="9521149">This might be a desirable thing to do, but we see nothing in the Court's decisions or the Constitution itself which requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.852" offset="9561378">Accordingly, when a state has entered into the domain in which the federal government has long been supreme, assuming a function which is not a traditional integral state function, we would submit that the state is not in the position to contest the operation of the supremacy clause, and that the decision in National League of Cities simply has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.968" offset="9653851">We urge that the decision of the court below be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.836" offset="9713306">The question before the Court in this case is whether Congress has the power to require a state to permit certain of its employees, employees involved in aspects of public transit, the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.955" offset="9777776">This Court has determined that the Constitution imposes an affirmative limitation on the exercise of the federal commerce power in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.248" offset="9814870">And we submit that the facts of this case... the fact of whether the employees of this state owned and operated railroad should have the right to strike by virtue of federal mandate... fits easily within the critical parameters of the immunity guaranteed by National League of Cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.304" offset="9891148">Those parameters are two: first, whether the nature of the decision is such, the choice made the state is such that it touches so closely on the essence of sovereignty as to quality for immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.435" offset="13279647">But in the case of the commuter railroad, the economy and the social well-being of the City of New York in my judgment collapses if we don't have public transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.977" offset="13321861">I think that is a fact of which the Second Circuit took notice and which this Court can take notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.318" offset="13343177">And there is no other available alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.973" offset="13353835">Unlike the railroad at issue in California v. Taylor, unlike the oil and gas development at issue in a National League of Cities case decided by the Fifth Circuit, unlike the telephone company at issue in another case, unlike even the Boston Street Railway at issue in Helvering v. Powers, this public transit service in New York is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority with subsidies amounting to more than a billion dollars a year because there is no alternative and because the public depends on this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.771" offset="13505032">If you take away the Long Island Railroad service from the 260,000 passengers a day and you take away the bus and subway service from the millions of passengers who depend on it, the economy and the society in New York as we know it collapses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.327" offset="13579220">That's why transit service has occupied such an important place in the public agenda in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.807" offset="13609208">The fact that it didn't have that place on the agenda 50 years ago or 100 years ago does not, in my view, disqualify it from the immunity afforded by National League of Cities, because the question must be what public services are those which the state most needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.971" offset="13685799">If you take the Government's view and say a railroad is a railroad, it's still part of the national railroad system because it does this little bit of freight traffic, if we abandoned the freight, the case wouldn't be before you because the statutory jurisdiction would be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.698" offset="13760718">It would then be a commuter railroad operating in one state and not subject to the Railway Labor Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.274" offset="13787050">Because we do, because we do get three or four percent of our revenue from freight traffic, a percentage declining every year, we're subject to the statute, and therefore the constitutional issue arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.236" offset="13842847">But I suggest that if you ask yourself, if the courts faced with these problems ask themselves is this a service on which the public depends, are there any available alternatives, the cases begin to sort themselves out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.934" offset="13909616">The cases where the state has exercised its sovereign power to go into a business enterprise, to go into an enterprise, as Chief Justice Burger put it in the City of Lafayette case, where it interrelates and competes with private sector actors, those cases fall aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.628" offset="13984431">There's no National League of Cities immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3622.327" offset="14639269">That $9 or $10 million contrasts with about $200 million of operating revenue... that's 10 percent... and over $400 million of total revenue, including public subsidies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.290" offset="14695066">And my figure of four percent, which was based on 1979, would now actually be about 2 1/2 percent for 1981 if you look at the total revenue picture rather than just the fare box revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.613" offset="14756402">And I suggest that on one level the statistics don't matter whether it's four percent or six percent or two percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.361" offset="14783360">What we do know from the historical record is that the amount of freight service is declining; as a result of freight rate deregulation it is likely to decline further.</text>

            <text syncTime="4009.251" offset="16186971">In fact, we believe that under state law, as has been true in the bus and subway system, we will have good collective bargaining, we will have fair wage settlements, we will avoid strikes hopefully, although as you know, we did not in 1980, and we will have most of all the State of New York making its own choice about the way in which authority is to be shared with employee organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.850" offset="16293342">And in these circumstances, I think as Solicitor General Bork conceded in the National League of Cities argument, that decision on the design of collective bargaining procedures is at the very center of sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.157" offset="16350602">There's no choice, no decision in this day and age that a state government makes that is as important to the exercise of its governmental authority as its choice about how and when and whether to engage in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.416" offset="16411624">And we submit, on the other side of the case, that there's no service that the state provides that is as much at the heart of sovereign power in the sense of public dependence and the lack of available alternatives than is transit service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.519" offset="16472020">Finally, the fact of the matter is when the State of New York through the MTA addresses transit problems, it doesn't distinguish between the Long Island Railroad and the bus and subway system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.984" offset="16521861">It decides... I mean what, after all, does the MTA chairman and the board decide?</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.542" offset="16544118">They pick people to run those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.963" offset="16553731">They decide on a capital budget program, including last year's authorization for $7.8 billion of improved capital improvements, $750 million on the Long Island Railroad; and they decide how to structure their relationships with the employees who provide the service, and how to negotiate fairly with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.080" offset="16638263">All those decisions are made by the chairman and the board of the MTA not by saying the Long Island is different from the bus and subway system; they're all part of the same system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.451" offset="16679745">And in fact, even the technology is hard to distinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.058" offset="16694165">Certainly the Long Island still has point-to-point fares, and they still have conductors collecting tickets, but three-quarters of their passenger cars are self-propelled electrical cars drawing electric power from a third rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.255" offset="16754978">The definition that APTA, the trade association, has to distinguish a heavy rail subway from a commuter railroad is that a commuter railroad is featured by point-to-point fares and railroad employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.656" offset="16816522">And I suggest that the question of whether this commuter railroad should have railroad employment practices is not a definition that distinguishes it from subways; it's the very issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.899" offset="16869499">It's the question of whether this is a service that qualifies for immunity for those federal commerce regulations that go to the heart of the state's exercise of its sovereignty.</text>
