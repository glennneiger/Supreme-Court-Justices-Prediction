            <text syncTime="15.560" offset="192276">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.462" offset="211921">This is an appeal from a decision of the Alaska Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.381" offset="227594">That decision declared constitutional a statute which distributes income from Alaska's permanent fund based solely on the duration of the residency of the recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.923" offset="277749">The fund itself was set up in 1976 as a respository for surplus revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.260" offset="303140">In 1980, some four years after the fund was created, this statute was passed, and it proposes to allocate one half of the income of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.116" offset="342533">It is this statute and not the existence of the fund itself which the Appellants challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.370" offset="371581">The case is unlike every other durational residency case which has come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.458" offset="399898">In those cases the durational residency requirement was being used as a test; it was being used as a test of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.664" offset="436678">Here the Appellants are unquestioned Alaskans.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.849" offset="449426">Here it's not being used as a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.801" offset="457263">Here it's simply being used to assign legal status to persons who are unquestionably Alaskans.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.542" offset="1012208">If the right of interstate migration and the right to acquire citizenship in the state in which one resides mean anything, they must mean that a state is not free to hand a new migrant a number at the border and say here, this number is going to determine your legal status in our local tax system for as long as you remain here.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.574" offset="1112309">Durational residency requirements are sometimes permissible as a test of the bona fides of a claim of state citizenship, but the constitutional minimum has to be that at some point the test is over.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.706" offset="1204887">That very point was recognized by this Court 110 years ago in the Slaughterhouse cases when the Court observed that the 14th Amendment itself created a substantive federally guaranteed right to become a citizen of any state through bona fide residence with the same rights as other citizens of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.020" offset="1294121">The Constitution doesn't allow a state to have classes of citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.089" offset="6242445">The creation of the fund does two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.323" offset="6259372">First of all, of course it saves a portion of the money for the future, 25 percent at a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.227" offset="6282987">But more important, it transforms a finite resource into an infinite source of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.864" offset="6313498">By restricting the legislature to the use only of the interest on the fund, that interest can continue in perpetuity, at least in theory; so that government programs constructed on it, social programs and the like, can continue long after the oil is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.776" offset="6381207">Public expectations will be based not on the principle of the fund because that is not appropriated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.097" offset="6402418">Well, I assume you're going to relate that program to this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.832" offset="6421331">Now, when you set that up, it creates an immediate public and a political conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.337" offset="6451424">On the one hand you have the legislature which is faced with rather pressing public needs, to say nothing of their own political futures, faced with large infusions of oil wealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.612" offset="6496459">They have use of 75 percent of all the oil wealth that comes in, plus the interest from the 25 percent that goes into the Permanent Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.816" offset="6529269">And on the other hand there is the public interest in trying to preserve as much as this oil wealth for the long term as humanly possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.772" offset="6565109">Now, it's easy to see the political pressures on the legislature to spend the money; we're all familiar with those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.176" offset="6590709">But there was no countering political pressure for the legislature to increase the payments into the Permanent Fund, to put more than the 25 percent mandated by the constitutional amendment, and to put more of the oil money in there to be saved for future generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.001" offset="6658105">So the Governor proposed what is I call a unique program, but it's perfectly tailored to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.791" offset="6693214">He suggested that since the residents of the state owned the resources, owned the oil resources, that to the extent that oil revenues placed in the Permanent Fund produced income, interest which was surplus to present government needs, that those monies should be distributed directly to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.491" offset="6796032">Now, it's immediately obvious that when you do that two things happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.012" offset="6814108">The first of all is that since the people will receive dividends directly and only from interest within the Permanent Fund, on monies placed in the Permanent Fund, it puts enormous pressure on the legislature to put as much money in the Permanent Fund as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.838" offset="6881400">Now people have a personal interest in seeing the Permanent Fund maximized, because they will receive greater dividends the more and more money is placed in the Permanent Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.696" offset="6924867">And the second thing it does is that it creates in Alaska the type of check on political spending which is present in every other state but not present in ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.489" offset="6984009">For instance, in Kansas if you want to establish a government program, you have to tax for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.326" offset="7011385">You have to impose a tax on the people, and it better be a good government program or you better not impose the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.413" offset="7035731">There's a political debit to meet the political credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.065" offset="7050360">In Alaska since the legislature can simply fund government programs through the sale of oil leases, which people are sufficiently remote from that they do not really consider their own, that when you transform those oil leases and the money from them into the Permanent Fund and say to the people there's going to be money produced from this oil, now, if it's surplus to the government needs it will be distributed to you in some form, and on the other hand the legislature can spend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.903" offset="7177628">Now, the legislature is free to spend it--</text>

            <text syncTime="1794.657" offset="7308658">Now, the question... I tried to establish that because once you get to that point, Justice Marshall, then you are trying to determine how to distribute the dividends, what is the best manner in which to distribute the dividends, certainly consistent with the 14th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.200" offset="7374905">Alaska has no exemption from the 14th Amendment, nor do we claim it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.121" offset="7390578">Now, in distributing the dividends the legislature selected a system whereby they tried to make the individual interest in receipt of the dividends identical with the public interest in maintaining a long term and healthy Permanent Fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.165" offset="7570719">Now, let's think for a moment about how these dividends could be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.869" offset="7597573">I don't think that the 14th Amendment requires necessarily that everyone be treated identically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.006" offset="7626098">The candidate in New Hampshire who has to wait for seven years to run for governor is not being treated exactly the same as a candidate who doesn't have to wait.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.297" offset="7675209">What we're talking about is are the distinctions made in this dividend plan rational or are they not rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.320" offset="7707287">Now, let's take a perfectly equal distribution for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.255" offset="7723065">Suppose the state determined to distribute dividends one to each resident each year regardless of how long they had lived in the state.</text>
