            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Cole</label>
            <text syncTime="10.434" offset="177696">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.667" offset="194624">The case is here on appeal from a divided court of appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.602" offset="222314">The case presents the questions of whether the prohibitions and limitations on trade association solicitation contained in 1976 Amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act can survive the exacting scrutiny demanded by the First and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.861" offset="291381">It is our position in brief that the restrictions and limitations are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.076" offset="312279">I think in order to fully appreciate the genesis of the case and the precise nature of the prohibitions that are involved, one must go back to a time prior to May of 1976, which was the effective date of the 1976 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.274" offset="377063">Prior to that time, trade associations solicited voluntary political contributions from a wide and broad range of people, basically who fell within... people who shared a commonality or affinity of political interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.595" offset="446340">Those political solicitations were undertaken without regard to whether or not the prospective contributor was an employee of a member corporation of the trade association.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.308" offset="505167">And, most importantly, they were undertaken without obtaining the prior permission of anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.852" offset="527319">With the coming of the 1967 Amendments, however, trade association solicitation underwent a radical and drastic transformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.787" offset="559084">For now, no longer could trade associations solicit from this rather broad group of people who shared a commonality of purpose and interests; rather, they were restricted by the Act to either their own shareholders or their own executives and administrators... and that range of people was very small by virtue of the inherent characteristics of trade associations... and/or they could solicit the executives and administrative personnel and the stockholders of those member corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.430" offset="697638">But in addition to these restrictions, perhaps the most throttling restriction was that before even that narrow solicitation could be undertaken, the trade association political action committee had to receive the permission from the member corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.296" offset="773184">That is to say, the executive or administrative employee could not make a determination on his own of whether or not he wanted to be solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.667" offset="806621">That task was entrusted by the Act to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.602" offset="830340">The corporation had sole and unthrottled discretion in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.555" offset="842147">It was unreviewable by anybody, and indeed, it could be denied without regard to the wishes of the corporate employee himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.629" offset="874434">In addition to that restriction, the Act imposed one final restriction, and that was even if all of the other statutory prohibitions had been satisfied, and even if the corporation in its largesse gave permission, the potential contributor could only be solicited by one trade association, regardless of the amount of overlap of membership in other separate, distinct and autonomous associations.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="214.602" offset="994389">Mr. Cole, is there anything in the Act that prevents a trade association from seeking to add these people as members of the trade association?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_cole" startTime="223.895" stopTime="389.406">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Cole</label>
            <text syncTime="223.895" offset="1031483">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there is absolutely nothing except the practical realities of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.300" offset="1049141">The Act itself, as you rightly point out, does not restrict a trade association from going out and soliciting people to join with it as a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.374" offset="1081429">The difficulty is, and the record makes clear, that trade associations have rather large operating budgets.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.950" offset="1111731">Individuals do not have the wherewithal... and I suspect they do not have the inclination... to be able to support a trade association's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.664" offset="1154572">So the right to solicit for individual membership is largely illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.895" offset="1179545">But even if it were not, Your Honor, if underlying your question is the suggestion that has been made by the government that we could thus avoid the restraints of the sections of the Act, then I think we are giving constitutional significance to an irrelevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.343" offset="1241298">I am aware of no case in the history of this Court, or any court, which has said otherwise unconstitutional prohibitions are okay and are palatable simply because there is a method of avoiding them.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.852" offset="1311411">And that is what the Seventh Circuit said and that is what the government is suggesting to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.426" offset="1333667">The effect of these various restrictions, both collectively and individually, was I think as the district court's unchallenged findings of fact make clear, at once profound and immediate.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.108" offset="1396361">The district court found that the Act found that the Act had substantially curtailed the solicitation activities of the trade associations; that it had impaired substantially their right to collect voluntary political contributions and thus to make further contributions; and perhaps most importantly, it had limited the rights of potential solicitees, those people having this commonality of political interests, from being able to affiliate with the trade association political action committee and with other like-minded people.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.907" offset="1531571">As a consequence of these restraints and as a consequence of the impositions imposed by the Act, we filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District for Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.262" offset="1577024">After some very protracted proceedings in that court and in the Court of Appeals, the case ultimately came on for hearing before the Seventh Circuit sitting en banc pursuant to Section 437h of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.351" offset="1633344">The decision of the court below was divided in some instances and unanimous in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.079" offset="1684230">The court unanimously held that the plaintiffs had standing under 2 U.S.C. 437h to maintain the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.016" offset="1687992">The court, however--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="389.406" stopTime="401.324">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="389.406" offset="1693530">Mr. Cole, on that point, how does the committee fit under the language of the statute, 437h, as a plaintiff?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_cole" startTime="401.324" stopTime="535.128">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Cole</label>
            <text syncTime="401.324" offset="1741282">--We certainly do not contend that we fit within the explicit enumerated categories of people set forth in 437h.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.930" offset="1775659">We are not the Federal Election Commission, and we are certainly not the National Committee of a political party, and we are certainly not, as an entity, individuals eligible to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.300" offset="1821112">Although, Your Honor, let me point out that our members, at least the members of the Political Action Committees themselves, which are separate, distinct entities as this Court held in California Medical Association, are comprised solely and completely of members, of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.183" offset="1884642">The Federal Election Commission has never contested that point from the time the Seventh Circuit panel announced its decision in 1979 saying that aside from everything else, the plaintiffs had associational standing under the rules of this Court by virtue of our representation of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.832" offset="1967293">The Commission has never suggested or said that we do not represent individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.329" offset="1989236">They simply have said that we don't fall within the literal language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.765" offset="2006999">So I think, Your Honor, that we have associational standing without any question at all, but beyond that, it seems to me that merely because we don't fall within the explicit enumerations of the Act does not mean that we are not a proper party.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.822" offset="2063215">The purpose of that statute, 437h, as this court unequivocally held in Buckley, was to provide standing to the limit of Article III of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.317" offset="2109190">That beneficent purpose cannot possibly be fulfilled if only the three explicitly enumerated parties are accorded standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.765" offset="2147016">It would mean that unions, trade associations and corporations, who are the entities most intimately and profoundly affected by the 1976 Amendments, at least in the context of this case, could not maintain an action under 437h, even though an anonymous voter from Boise, Idaho who had absolutely no interest in the particular provisions could come into court, get the substantially expedited review that the statute allows, while unions, corporations and others--</text>

            <text syncTime="535.128" offset="2276478">Well, is this an argument that if Congress, after enumerating those three, had said "and no one else", the statute would be unconstitutional?</text>

            <text syncTime="544.732" offset="2314931">--I think, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the Congress perhaps could well have suggested that only those three explicitly-enumerated categories of people could avail themselves of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.945" offset="2375744">The question is, though, it does not say "and only those".</text>
            <text syncTime="563.756" offset="2390999">And thus, one must divine the legislative intent underlying that statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_cole" startTime="585.357" stopTime="619.109">

            <text syncTime="585.357" offset="2477412">If by that, Mr. Chief Justice, you mean it is meant to be explicitly exclusive, I disagree with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.386" offset="2501549">If you mean it says what it says, of course I agree with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.760" offset="2515029">But I recall Mr. Justice Frankfurter's admonition that the notion that because the words of the statute are plain it's meaning is also plain is pernicious over-simplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.428" offset="2549615">And one must look at the legislative intent underlying the statute, and the intent clearly is to provide expedition in appellate review, and the certainty of review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.331" offset="2593292">And that's perhaps the most important factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.577" offset="6666304">I would like to deal first with the issue of regarding 437h, which is the sole basis for jurisdiction asserted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.965" offset="6699845">In effect, I think that the question before the Court is a question that was explicitly left open by the California Medical Association case last term, and that is whether the parties not enumerated by the statute have standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts to hear cases under the specialized procedures of Section 437h.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.473" offset="6781869">Basically, we have here a conflict with appellants on both questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.204" offset="6812798">Appellants, it seems to me, assert two bases under which this Court should read 437h as allowing them to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.653" offset="6850519">First they argue that as a matter of this Court's associational rights doctrine, that they are sufficiently related to individuals to be able to assert those rights as an association on behalf of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.054" offset="6908198">They draw on the long line of cases, some of them referred to by this Court, in Buckley with regard to associations that were there, that say that individuals... that started from the premise that individuals should be able to assert constitutional rights when those rights might be lost if they didn't assert them, and have since been expanded to a much broader basis that allows associations to assert individual constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.761" offset="7011016">We would urge this Court, however, not to extent that to this case because the plaintiffs here are not associations which represent individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.273" offset="7049050">They are, indeed, trade associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.100" offset="7056364">They represent the business interests, they are controlled by corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.959" offset="7071829">The record is replete with the fact that all of the governing structure of all of these trade associations comes from the corporate membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.143" offset="7108505">The voting rights... there are not individual voting rights, and by and large, the control of those is left to the business interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.811" offset="7139225">And therefore, what is represented by these trade associations and by their separate segregated funds, the political committees which they have established, which they finance and which they control, are the interests of the trade associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.165" offset="7192619">And I would have this Court look at its decision in the Pipefitters case for the fact that clearly, a corporation's separate segregated fund... the political committee that it was allowed to establish under the 1971-72 Amendments and that this Court examined in the 1973 case of Pipefitters, that the control there is with the trade association, with the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.828" offset="7291257">Moreover, under those amendments, they are explicitly allowed to establish and to finance, to maintain, those, so that there is in this statute not... the political committee is not the paradigm of a political committee made up of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.133" offset="7356459">The statute establishes these committees as controlled by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.708" offset="7382790">Accordingly, while they are,... as we have not contested, while the contributions to them are ones that are made voluntarily by individuals, they are not associations in the sense of individual associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.062" offset="7440155">They are not a situation of ten individuals getting together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.624" offset="7454470">Indeed, one of the balances struck by Congress in the statute was explicitly noted by this Court in the CIO case and in the legislative history, that nothing in this statute bars ten individuals who are members of the union from going out and setting up a political action committee, or of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.349" offset="7529389">What is barred by this statute is the use of the corporate or labor organization funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.659" offset="7550601">So that what is at issue here with regard to the 437h issue in the associational sense is the question that we have put forth, and contrary to my brother, Mr. Cole, I think that the Commission has consistently challenged the fact that they have standing to assert individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.231" offset="7628864">A second challenge that they bring to the 437h area is that it's the nature of the challenge which should dominate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.789" offset="7663136">They agree, as was said in response to Justice O'Connor's question, that they are not among the enumerated parties, but they say that those enumerated parties are not what establishes the standing; that the standing is much broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.378" offset="7713501">That indeed, as they have phrased it, particularly in their opening brief, it is the nature of the challenge that Congress was putting forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.782" offset="7747042">In support of that, they have... as the bare words of the statute, which say explicitly and which we have contented throughout say explicitly, only three parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.494" offset="7801899">The opinion of the court below indicated that they felt that the reason for putting in those three parties was to expand the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.427" offset="7837634">That there might have been doubt about any one of those three... the Commission, the national committee of a political party or an individual eligible to vote,... as to whether they could bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.549" offset="7870131">The words of the statute are bare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.954" offset="7883819">The legislative history of the statute does not seem to me to support the idea that that was meant to be read that broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.514" offset="7914016">So it seems to me that this Court is remitted to the basic idea that Congress would be the one that establishes the jurisdiction, and indeed, appellants here do not challenge the fact that this is a question of interpretation, of what was Congress' intent in enacting this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.319" offset="7981203">And once again, we would urge this Court to view that as not being a broad base attempt to say that anyone can bring suit, but that the Congress very explicitly set forth those parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.955" offset="8031776">That particularly where you are talking... and as we've noted in cases cited... particularly where you are talking extraordinary jurisdiction, as you certainly are where you have a certification of issues from a district court, an en banc court of appeals and a right of appeal to this Court, that the ordinary thrust would be to construe that narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.775" offset="8115055">Thus, with regard to the 437h issue, we would urge this Court to reject both of the theories that they have put forth for the broad interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.663" offset="8282656">I think that question goes to the heart of another disagreement that we have with appellants, which is really the effect of the 1976 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.628" offset="8318496">Which is to say, as was said in response to Justice White's questions, in the Commission's view, this statute is part and parcel of the 441b prohibitions which have been in the statute since 1907; they were originally there as 18 U.S.C. 610, and contain a broad prohibition on the use of corporation funds, any corporation whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.261" offset="8405014">But that prohibition has been balanced over time by the Congress and by decisions of this Court and the Congress' reactions to those decisions for those parties specified in 441b, corporations and labor organizations, a balance of that that allows them to establish, finance, maintain and control a fund which is allowed to solicit contributions from that are part of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.920" offset="8539597">What it referred to in the legislative history as the beneficial owners, that going back to 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.467" offset="8545866">In 1947, the amendment to include labor organizations where the statute then put that forth as members, that members were the parallel in the labor organization situation to the shareholders of the corporation, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.056" offset="8596126">So that the statutory interest underlying this is a limitation of the use of the corporation's funds, and these trade associations are corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.411" offset="8629563">The use of those funds to solicit outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.410" offset="8649625">That the compromise, the balance that was reached between the initial enactment, the 1947 enactments, the response to that in the CIO case and then the Pipefitters case, was a special situation for these organizations, which allows a corporation to spend all of the corporate funds for the limited purpose of communicating with its beneficial owners and the operators, the executive and administrative personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.541" offset="8758085">So that the government purpose underlying, the governmental basis underlying it, is that of 441b.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.587" offset="8914297">So in that sense, I think the response is yes, you could have that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.672" offset="8998621">So there are really three prongs to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.812" offset="9007189">They establish it, maintain it, financial support, pay for its solicitations, put out the money to put the solicitations out, and pursuant to the Pipefitters case, control these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.401" offset="9053582">Now, if none of those four elements were there,... in other words, if they didn't establish it, didn't maintain it, didn't finance it, didn't finance its solicitations and didn't control it, it would seem to me you would then have a truly voluntary situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.596" offset="9134353">But with those four elements there... and I think any one of those four elements is sufficient, but those are the four major ones... you don't have a situation where the trade association could use volunteers, because it would have established the separate segregated fund and maintained, financed and controlled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.967" offset="9171865">I would note, incidentally, that throughout this case there has been no challenge to the basic provisions of 441b.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.042" offset="9200077">Appellants here have no desire whatsoever to give up the permission of the statute that allows them to do that financially-valuable support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.055" offset="9236126">The trade associations... there's a rising number of political committees in all areas, but particularly in the corporate and trade association area, one finds that in recent years with the development of the law, here has been a vast expansion of trade associations using their funds to support political committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.172" offset="9304671">The permission of the statute allowing them to do that is very, very valuable to them and is very valuable to the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.958" offset="9407803">Yes, I think that's correct, and I think that one of the factors with regard to this case is that this is an area in which Congress, over the course of time, particularly in 1971 and 1976, has come to regulate the area with great precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.813" offset="9463182">There is a very narrow regulation here compared to the historical development, in the sense that the 1907 statute was just what is the beginning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.620" offset="9510412">You now in 1976 the insertion not only of Subsection (D), but of Subsections (A), (B) and (C), (4)(A), (B), (C) and (D), which spell out with great precision the balance, in terms of the solicitation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.146" offset="9568508">And quite frankly, our view is that the corporation's rights to solicit it shareholders and executive and administrative personnel have been here expanded by Section (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.625" offset="9610408">Thus, the argument from appellant's side is without Section (D)... Section (D) was a limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2380.557" offset="9658160">What you have in Section (D), what Congress did in 1976, was to add a broader permission that was brought in front of them that trade associations therefore had very limited solicitation rights, and they came to the result that is now in front of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.997" offset="12775927">Appeal taken from that goes up to the court of appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which determine that the jurisdiction lies under 437h, and remands the case to be treated as a 437h case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.266" offset="12901001">With regard to the two issues raised with regard to the narrow matter of the Subsection (D) here, the basic... and I think I indicated this in response to Justice Brennan's question... but the basic congressional interest there was similar to that in the anti-proliferation area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.992" offset="12983966">Section (D) permits only the solicitation of only one... allows a corporation to allow solicitation of its employees, of its shareholders and executive and administrative personnel only by one trade association, and it is quite explicit in the legislative history that the congressional balancing there, once again, was the limitation of the fact that otherwise, corporations being members of many trade associations would be able to... you would have a proliferation of the funds available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.511" offset="13109981">And that the basic underlying congressional thrust for this statute was the limitation of those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.477" offset="13137879">Finally, with regard to the once-a-year provision that Congress has enacted, that appears to be a provision that is designed to assure that the permission that is granted is one that is not done on a continuing basis; i.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.453" offset="13221785">e, that the reaffirmation that that is the trade association that the corporation feels that its members can be solicited by is one that is reaffirmed constantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.247" offset="13252923">I would note that it is also one that the Commission, in speaking in its recommendations to Congress, has thought that Congress may want to re-examine as perhaps not being worth the effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.305" offset="13301197">But it seems to me that as to its basic constitutionality, the underlying basis for it is the same as the overall basis for the 441b(4)(D) to support the 441b(4)(D) provisions altogether.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Cole</label>
            <text syncTime="3309.188" offset="13372668">Yes, Your Honor, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.860" offset="13379355">The government has conceded, as I think that it must, that the avowed purpose of the restraints in Section (D) are to limit the fund-raising potential of trade associations as opposed to all other groups, unions and corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.761" offset="13435048">This Court, in Buckley, has specifically and unambiguously repudiated that sort of an attempt as being violative of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.600" offset="13470366">The Court there said that attempts to equalize the relativability of individuals in groups to influence the outcome of elections is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.863" offset="13511430">The concept that government may restrict the speech... and it seems to me a fortiori the associational rights of people... of some elements of society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.716" offset="13562839">The purposes underlying the Federal Corrupt Practices Act and its successor are twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.729" offset="13594918">It is to eliminate the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large campaign contributions, and equally important as Mr. Justice Powell pointed out in Belotti, as Jr. Justice Frankfurter initially pointed out in the Auto Workers case, indeed as Mr. Justice White pointed out even in his dissent in the Rent Control case against Berkeley, is to preserve the citizens' confidence in government and to actively underwrite and encourage their participation in our Democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.625" offset="13710483">The restraints of Section (D) make a mockery out of that second but equally primary goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.512" offset="13737964">The notion that a citizen's right to be solicited, to talk to another person about the ability to contribute money and to affiliate himself thereby with other like-minded people, that that can be made to depend upon the whim of his corporate employer, in ny view trivializes the First Amendment and makes a mockery out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.395" offset="13817585">It goes a giant step towards not advancing, but retarding the goal of citizens' participation and confidence in government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.438" offset="13853739">At pages 8 through 13, of our reply brief, we have addressed at some length the question that Mr. Justice Brennan raised about the purposes of the anti-proliferation rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.776" offset="13903058">And obviously, time simply does not allow me to answer those questions, but I do urge the Court to review those pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.040" offset="13932106">And there is one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.538" offset="13938062">I have mis-spoke myself, Mr. Justice Powell, and I want to apologize if I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.241" offset="13956870">I'd like to clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.567" offset="13962199">Prior to the 1976 Amendments, trade associations solicited without regard to the restraints imposed now by Section (D), they solicited all those people within the range of affinity of interest without regard to whether they were corporate employees of member corporations, and they did so without obtaining anyone's prior permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.948" offset="14055718">Those funds that were voluntarily contributed were then expended by the trade association PAC's in federal elections, consistent with the course of behavior that had gone on for the last 30 or 40 years.</text>
