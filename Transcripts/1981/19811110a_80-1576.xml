            <text syncTime="1249.642" offset="5075925">I -- I have no problem with PruneYard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.958" offset="5093271">I think PruneYard first involved the shopping center, had no expressive activity and I think that was quite clear that the premises had never been used for expressive activity even though there were some concern by at least some members of the Court in that regard when it came to the expressive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.893" offset="5176967">Secondly, the basis for that decision in Justice Newman's Court in his state court decision was that shopping centers had replaced downtown centers into a dangerous degree and that the problems of communicating on political matters with large numbers of people were seriously impaired by the exclusion of those activities on shopping centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.268" offset="5294518">So, there was I think a compelling state reason for requiring the owners to permit these activities on those premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.171" offset="5358048">And the third reason that I would urge which was -- is related to it is that the California court having made that decision set a rule which it set all shopping centers which may be somewhat vague, but all shopping centers have to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.588" offset="5427743">And there is no test which analyzes the content of what the visitor on the premises wants to say as against the content of what the person whose expressive activities are involved wants to say --</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.802" offset="8916552">Yes sir, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.740" offset="8924389">But under Flagg Brothers, we would argue that is not the kind for state action which Princeton can assert that if this case is properly styled as Princeton University versus Schmid, Princeton University and the State of New Jersey on the appellant side which is the style for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.297" offset="9010593">What Princeton University must show is state action residing in appellee Schmid and there is no such state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.362" offset="9046851">Perhaps, Princeton University has an argument with the State of New Jersey obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.365" offset="9070884">Princeton University has an argument with the State of New Jersey but it would say that's it's precisely the kind of argument held by Brooks with the State of New York as to whether or not the State of New York could allow of the garage in that case to sell the property without first running a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.929" offset="9149147">And this Court held that that was not state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.879" offset="9160954">Under power of a state law, yes, state action, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.639" offset="9179971">That we feel is a serious problem facing the Court should it reach the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.592" offset="9207765">In all candor, I might say that appellee Schmid would endorse the overruling of Flagg Brothers verus Brooks in returning indeed to Logan Valley because that would make state actions what Princeton asks for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.117" offset="9269832">The use of coercive state processes to punish a person for exercising free speech rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.434" offset="9303165">We do not argue that if you find state action, Schmid loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.795" offset="9324585">We argue that Schmid wins either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.891" offset="9336915">But Flagg Bothers must be addressed both by appellant Princeton and by this Court if their claims on the merits are to be reached at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.734" offset="9380383">In the PruneYard case, neither of the parties briefed the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.932" offset="9401071">There is one mention of Flagg Brothers in one footnote of an amicus opinion and therefore, this Court cannot address the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.878" offset="9432941">It easily submits a fresh issue before this Court on what the implications of Flagg Brothers are for cases like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.523" offset="9475468">We therefore move to the issue on the merits where we obviously are willing to defend of a highly differential New Jersey State decision, a decision differential to the interest of Princeton University as we point out in our brief and as the amicus brief of the American Association of University Professors points out at length, the New Jersey Supreme Court took full recognition of the legitimate rights of Princeton University.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.914" offset="9605036">What they correctly found is that Princeton University presented no reason whatsoever to keep Schmid off its campus and the State of New Jersey has a strong tradition in support of political speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.585" offset="9675775">That is not only the rational interest but we would argue if need be the compelling state interest that the state sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.847" offset="9716735">The brief mentions of the Republican forms of Government Clause that is obviously not judicially enforceable by this Court going back -- back to Luther versus Borden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.101" offset="9765845">But we would argue that the Republican forms of Government Clause points to the essential underpinning of what our system of government is about which is a free relatively unrestricted, relatively unstructured public dialogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.680" offset="9832092">And that is what the State of New Jersey, the very state protected even if not of -- protected by judicial enforcement, protected in the federal constitution and surely a State Supreme Court can construe its own state constitution to protect those basic Republican institutions of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.681" offset="9932089">And that's what they did in this case taking full measure of every interest that Princeton University could properly put before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.984" offset="9969287">And thus we argue -- we would be delighted if this Court reached the merits in spite of the jurisdictional and state action hurdles because it would seem inconceivable that a state could not act so as to protect the political dialogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.048" offset="10045565">In PruneYard versus Robins, United States participated in oral argument before this Court to point out its grave reservations as to the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, should the shopping center be upheld in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.339" offset="10134799">Similar issues are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.838" offset="10144725">What Princeton University argues on page eight of its reply brief and in oral argument this afternoon is that there is, “The right of a private university to determine its educational policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.863" offset="10204807">With educational policy being whatever is defined as such by Princeton or any other university.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.091" offset="10237721">This point has also made it like in the amicus brief of the American Association of University Professors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.318" offset="10262694">What if the policy which you referred the special authority of white males by hiring only white males to teach?</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.205" offset="10302191">Indeed, what if in furtherance of some notion having alleged educational policy princeton sought to use New Jersey trespass law in the context with attempting to keep up uninvited blacks though issuing a generous invitation to all whites and to invited blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.862" offset="10380872">Could New Jersey truly not refuse its aid or does the constitution compel that giving over of public power to such indefensible private ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.924" offset="10437088">The Bob Jones case will be before this Court later in this term and raises serious constitutional issues for the constitutional issues are those of the Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.366" offset="10486825">If Princeton University hang before this Court arguing that Presbyterian Doctrine forced the policy adapted in 1978, that would present a truly challenging question of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.157" offset="10562058">That does not raise questions of academic freedom at all however.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.132" offset="10581911">It raises questions of the free exercise of religion and issues blessedly not before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.487" offset="10615347">Neither the holding nor the opinion of the New Jersey Supreme Court reaches this far as Princeton would have us believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.913" offset="10645023">The decision of the court below is extremely narrow in its holding after a careful and detailed examination of the relationship between Schmid's speech interest and the actual policy operation from Princeton University had found Schmid's interest more weighty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.479" offset="10707298">So a vague recognition of the narrowness of the holding below, Princeton constantly asks this Court in its brief and in its argument to decide cases not before it even as plausible hypotheticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.252" offset="10762365">On the other hand, all of the arguments put forth in our argument are all too plausible because Princeton University has not offered and cannot offer a cogent distinction between what it asks for in this case and any future request to be exempt from the most basic statutes found necessary by Congress, state legislatures or the people of the state acting through their constitutive document in order to provide elemental social justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.389" offset="10906978">One final argument must be addressed more before by conclusion and that is the purported use by the court below of inadmissible content distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.861" offset="10944804">The court below does argue with distinguished among categories of speech but so of course does this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.897" offset="10976987">For example, political speech versus commercial speech, not to mention offensive speech or obscene speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.785" offset="11008543">Categorical distinctions, whatever the difficulties are wholly different from genuine content distinctions which say that for example within a given category certain speech is acceptable while other speech is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.895" offset="11068938">One cannot say for example that political speech about domestic policy is protected though debates about foreign policy is not or that one can only praise but not criticize public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.132" offset="11121914">That is the meaning of graded mostly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.629" offset="11131945">But it is far too late in the day to argue that all speech is one undifferentiated whole so that the deceptive (Inaudible) strength of a commercial salesperson is the constitutional equal of a political address.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.594" offset="11191818">In summary that this case graces a host of complex issues not the least of depth of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.457" offset="11223269">And these complexities can be most easily avoided through recognizing this as the moot controversy that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.542" offset="11251586">But my concluding remarks return to the merits because there, Princeton's arguments are not only wrong on the law but profoundly dangerous to the meaning of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.464" offset="11299233">The decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court does not open up the Princeton campus so those wishing to expound on the merits of their pizzas or used cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.138" offset="11341969">But to Chris Schmid who wishes to engage his fellow citizens in this course relating to the polity of which we are all apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.193" offset="11378123">It has become the duty of this Court to reject Princeton's claim of exemption from New Jersey's constitution and to reassert instead the right of a state to assure the preservation of the public discussion that undergirds a Republican form of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.686" offset="11448131">Indeed, this case presents an example of our uniquely federal system at its best.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.746" offset="11472373">The fact that the United States Constitution is interpreted by this Court has not been held to provide by its own force access to non-state controlled property saved for company towns does not preclude a state from structuring its laws to afford additional protection for important public values.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.496" offset="11559413">States are not to be sure of -- free to act without limits but their willingness to be imaginative and creative in responding to the exigencies of modern life should not be stifled unless constitutionally compelled.</text>
