            <text syncTime="9.153" offset="170108">Mr. Gottesman, you may proceed whenever you are ready--</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="12.449" offset="183274">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.728" offset="196440">At the 1978 convention of the Steelworkers Union... that is its highest governing body, including several thousand delegates selected by the members of each of its locals... the Constitution of the union was amended by adopting the rule that is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.095" offset="285883">That rule forbids candidates and their supporters... candidates for office within the union, for high office within the union... from soliciting or accepting campaign support from persons who are not members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.197" offset="354324">The purpose of the rule was to assure that those who got elected to high office in the union would be beholden only to the members of the union, and not, by virtue of the financial benefits they had received from outsiders, be beholden to those outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.096" offset="425899">The analogue in the federal statutes and with respect to federal elections to the rule that the steelworkers adopted is that provision which makes it unlawful for any candidate for federal office to solicit, accept or receive any contribution from a foreign national.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.588" offset="503849">The court below has held that the steelworkers rule violates Section 101(a)(2) of the Landrum-Griffin Act, a part of Title I of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.192" offset="550242">We sought review, and this Court granted a writ of certiorari to review two questions: first, whether that construction of the Landrum-Griffin Act is correct; and second, if it is, whether the Landrum-Griffin Act as thus construed to deprive the union and its members of the right to insulate their elections from outsider involvement, abridges the First Amendment freedom of association of the union's members, by taking from them the power to determine the appropriate standard of participation by others in its elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.193" offset="706246">I will talk first about the statutory construction issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.925" offset="725158">Whenever, as here, the question is the legitimacy of a union's election rule, statutory analysis properly begins... though, of course, it doesn't end... with Title IV of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.465" offset="787330">That is the title, entitled elections, which lays down election rules with respect to union elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.056" offset="821707">In that title, Congress prescribed a number of rules to govern union elections, frequency of elections, notice of elections and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.943" offset="861308">And one of the subjects that Congress specifically focused on in Title IV was the subject of campaign financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.938" offset="893282">In Title IV, Congress expressly provided that union monies and employer monies could not be donated to any candidate in a union election.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.450" offset="939258">And in Title IV, Congress expressly provided that every member of the union would have the right to provide campaign support to a candidate in a union election.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.601" offset="983875">Now, of course, there is a middle ground between that which Congress expressly forbad and that which Congress expressly protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.708" offset="1020342">There are non-members of the union whose capacity to contribute is not addressed on the face of Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.282" offset="1046569">But that does not mean that Title IV has no relevance to that question, because Congress in Title IV, having laid down and mandated for unions certain rules that they had to comply with in their elections, closed the circle; it didn't stop with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.666" offset="1120130">It said, beyond the rules that we prescribe in this title, unions will be free to choose their own election rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.583" offset="1155865">We have laid down certain minimum requirements, and beyond this we expressly provide that the choice as to any other election rules, not inconsistent with those that we, the Congress, have laid down, rests with the members of the union through their democratic processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.311" offset="1234755">That decision is reflected in two difference places in Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.996" offset="1249488">First, in Section 403 which provides that no labor organization shall be required by law to conduct election of officers in any different former manner than is required by its own constitution and bylaws, except as otherwise provided by this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.895" offset="1325034">And it is provided again in Section 401(e) which is one of the provisions that lays down the rules unions must obey.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.798" offset="1360665">And one of those rules is that the election shall be conducted in accordance with the constitution and bylaws of such organization, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of this title.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.654" offset="1540074">It would not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.731" offset="1544358">The rule has an express exception for volunteered personal services, so that a non-member of the union is free to donate his or her personal time to supporting a candidate in a union election.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.282" offset="1662641">Well, we have the same distinction here, Your Honor, that you have in the federal sector between expenditures and contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.233" offset="1686464">If they took these contributions from others, who presumably are not members of the union, and didn't give them to a candidate, or didn't spend them in cooperation with a candidate, the steelworkers rule would not implicated because they--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="406.053" offset="1757726">I am assuming good faith on the part of these people, that they want to get support, voting support, they want to get money to generate further support, and they want to get it from members of the union, members of the public, anywhere they can get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.860" offset="1816972">Do the union rules inhibit them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="425.609" stopTime="475.635">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="425.609" offset="1835885">--If they get the money from non-members and then give it to a candidate, or spend it with his cooperation, they would violate the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.449" offset="1879248">If they got money from non-members in order to finance activities of their own, independent of the candidate although expressing their support for him, that would not be a violation of the union's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.724" offset="1928358">In that sense, the distinction between expenditure and contribution in the union's rule is parallel to that in the federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.518" offset="1967542">And indeed, it is I think fairly obvious when you look at the union rule and the way it is structured that those who drafted it were not oblivious to the fact that some of these same questions had been considered and addressed in the federal statute, and many of the lines are the same, including the exception for volunteered personal time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="512.542" offset="2183627">Well, if the Court agrees with us that the union rule does not violate 101(a)(2), it has to address that only because respondents have offered it as an alternative basis for invalidating the entire rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.582" offset="2247784">We did not seek review of the court of appeals' holding that the rule violates that, because implicit in that, in our view, would simply be an injunction saying don't apply your rule to litigation, which is no problem for the union because we didn't think it applied to litigation in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.169" offset="2318210">But if the Court agrees with us that the rule does not violate 101(a)(2), that other provision comes into play only in the sense that respondents are here saying you should use that other provision to invalidate the whole rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.772" offset="2384561">And therefore, in that sense, the Court would possibly reach that issue and have to decide it one way or the other.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="570.550" offset="2415699">Mr. Gottesman, how common a situation is this?</text>
            <text syncTime="576.063" offset="2437746">Are you aware of any campaigns involving unions other than the steelworkers which... where outside funds played a prominent part?</text>

            <text syncTime="585.247" offset="2474422">The briefs for respondents recite... the record doesn't... that such outside funds were contributed substantially to the election in the mineworkers union several years ago, in which Tony Boyle was defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.273" offset="2530533">Beyond that, I personally am not, and the record does not show... it certainly had been the experience in the steelworkers in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.362" offset="2566895">It was George Meany's statement at that time that it was unprecedented in the history of the AFL-CIO that any of its affiliates had suffered an experience of an organized, concerted outsider involvement such as had occurred in the 1977 steelworker election.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.038" offset="2689671">No one has ever gotten less than 40 % of the vote in any presidential election in the steelworkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.348" offset="2714853">That is a strange statistics, but unquestionably a correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.657" offset="2748081">One challenger won and defeated the incumbent, so... and he got 51 % of the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.341" offset="2774830">The other three all got in a range of 40 % to 43 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.105" offset="2793952">Sadlowski got 43 %, the prior ones had gotten 41 % and 40 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.181" offset="2814223">The statement that appears in their briefs that he was the first serious challenger to an incumbent is, therefore, one that comes with some surprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.566" offset="3027800">The judgment of the union was that it would not, Your Honor, and the reasons are explained in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.033" offset="3049638">The problem with simply having disclosure and no ban is that you can counter exactly what happened in the 1977 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.843" offset="3084851">There was a candidate for office in the union who was, indeed, a very popular candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.575" offset="3099793">And who had taken a lot of outside money, and who wound up getting substantially less of a vote than people I think generally had thought he would get.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.712" offset="3136365">And what happened was, the voters in that union had to make a choice: they had to become one-issue voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.381" offset="3159039">They had a candidate that they would have preferred to leave the union, but the price for having him was going to be that they were going to have a candidate beholden to outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.363" offset="3198954">Now, it seems to me... and certainly it seemed to the union... that it is entitled to make the judgment that it is not enough, either in the way of protection or in the way of satisfying the members' interests, for people to know that one factor about a candidate is that he is potentially beholden to outsiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.730" offset="3272410">Because they can't adequately vindicate their concern about without automatically voting against him on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.398" offset="3299055">And beyond that, once you have some candidates doing this, it is inevitable they are all going to do it, just to equalize things, and then you are going to have a situation where the voter has no choice at all to avoid candidates beholden to outsiders, because they will be competing to see who can get more.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.844" offset="3368855">And the notion that incumbents are going to be less successful at getting outsider money is, I think, contrary to at least intuitive good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.154" offset="3406053">It was not the case in this election, but it could well be the case in other union elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.386" offset="3571042">The Labor Department's interpretation is that because the word "employer" is not qualified by "interested" employer, as it is in a different provision of the statute, it was Congress' intent that anybody who is an employer within the meaning... in interstate commerce, within the meaning of the statute, even though he has no involvement with this union, this union does not represent his employees, he doesn't do business with this union in any commercial sense... anybody who meets the statutory definition of an employer cannot contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.952" offset="3697266">And that includes any managing person cannot make personal contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.824" offset="3724747">So that a partner in a law firm, a dentist who employs two assistants, the person who owns the neighborhood bar, all of those people under the Labor Department's regulation and the Sixth Circuit decision are, in any event, precluded from contributing.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.875" offset="3832998">The term employer, as I recall it, is defined in the statute as anyone who is an employer under any other federal labor relations statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.372" offset="3866957">So that it picks up Railway Labor, National Labor Relations Act, and indeed, many people who aren't covered either because they are too small but are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.150" offset="3902066">So it is anybody, in essence, who employs one or more employees can't make either an institutional or a personal contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.773" offset="3932577">And that much is imposed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.553" offset="3943653">And the Sixth Circuit, the decision that I referred to, is Marshall versus Local 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.753" offset="3960476">It is 611 Fed 2d, 645.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.876" offset="3976985">The Sixth Circuit explained, this is what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.548" offset="3987643">It wanted these unions to be for their members and it wanted all of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.859" offset="4004884">That case involved a personal friend of the candidate who employed two people; he was a dentist.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.326" offset="4022752">And the court said that his contribution was a violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.761" offset="4036544">So that what the union is doing is filling a space that Congress in Title IV left open, but not such a broad space as perhaps is suggested by the briefs of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.522" offset="4095581">Now, in that Title IV scheme there is clear evidence as to why it is that Congress not only laid down certain rules but also laid down the additional provision that beyond these rules, the union shall be free to adopt their own and make their own choices with respect to election rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.482" offset="4171441">And what the legislation shows is that Congress was struggling with two objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.043" offset="4193697">On the one hand, the McClellan hearings had shown without doubt that there were some undemocratic unions, and that there were, in fact, certain statutory necessities that were going to be required if those unions were going to be made democratic and put back in the hands of their union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.551" offset="4263705">And so, Congress said we are going to lay down and mandate by federal law those rules that we have determined are essential to the achievement of union democracy, and those we have done in Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.467" offset="4319398">But the other congressional concern is that we do not intrude too far on union autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.762" offset="4348551">This was, after all, the first time that Congress had ever legislated with respect to internal union affairs, and the legislative reports are replete with statements... we are dealing here with private associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.881" offset="4404975">We, by enacting this statute, are tinkering with the mechanisms by which the leadership of private associations are selected, and in doing so, we want to act as limitedly as we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.781" offset="4460564">We have defined certain evils; we will mandate the correction of those evils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.357" offset="4478954">Beyond that we will not go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.340" offset="4490866">And more, beyond that, we will make clear that the choice will be for the union members of what their rules will be beyond this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.401" offset="4523049">More than that, the whole point of this statute was to return the governance of unions to their members, so the legislative history is replete with statements... we shouldn't go too far in legislating rules of the unions, not only because we violate their autonomy, but because we are unfaithful to the very purpose of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.234" offset="4610402">The purpose of this statute is we will create minimum standards that will be sufficient to give the union back to its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.325" offset="4638824">And certainly the record in this case shows that the steelworkers union is in the hands of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.213" offset="4662334">Candidates for office are defeated all the time, incumbents are removed at a rate equal if not exceeding that in federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.806" offset="4688665">And we will let the members make choices on all the matters except those that we have specifically dictated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.458" offset="4719281">And thus, we have in Title IV the closing of the circle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.363" offset="4734954">Certain rules laid down and a specific mandate that beyond that, the choice is for the union members and it cannot be dictated by any provision outside of Title IV.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.224" offset="5970337">We can't have all these... we have all these wonderful structural titles in this bill like Title IV, but if members are afraid to get up and speak because they are going to be expelled if they do so, those titles aren't going to work, nor will any of other objectives work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.608" offset="6027911">So we need here something that tells the union member if you speak, if you become a candidate, if you do these things, you are not going to be punished for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.432" offset="6063228">That was the objective of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.415" offset="6079111">Now, there is, to be sure, an overlap between Title IV and Title I, but it is not a redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.115" offset="6101994">If a member makes a campaign speech, to discipline him would violate both titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.536" offset="6123624">But in the statutory scheme, what Title IV says is that violation, the remedy will be setting aside the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.142" offset="6154030">What Title I says, and what was added by 101(a)(2) is that it is not going to be sufficient to protect the member's freedom to say that if he gets thrown out of the union, the election will be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.262" offset="6202513">We have got to give him personal protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.915" offset="6221113">He gets a personal remedy, and that was designed to give him the sanctuary that would allow him to be free to enforce his rights and to voice his views.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.659" offset="6292166">And the emphasis I think is on the word "any".</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.144" offset="6302092">This was a protection to members who express any views, even those that are disapproved by the leadership of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.390" offset="6335006">And it is not, I think, legitimate, given what Title IV expressly says about election rules, to say that what Congress was doing over here with those words was creating a new campaign finance provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.586" offset="6391849">There is nothing in the language and nothing in the legislative history that suggests that that was Congress intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.944" offset="6417240">The sole argument on the other side is an analogy to the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.067" offset="6441795">We have dealt extensively with that supposed analogy in our briefs and shown why we think it to be flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.891" offset="6469067">If... not the least of which is that it fails to note that the constitutional analogy that is being relied upon is one that was first articulated by this Court 17 years after this statute was enacted, and that it is not likely that Congress could have conceived, even if it was intending to legislate the First Amendment, that to do so would have carried with it those implications.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.342" offset="13486810">In 59, Congress realized they had to do something to protect the rights of the public and to make those rights count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.245" offset="13522441">So what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.306" offset="13526726">They set up a statute where union democracy would flourish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.851" offset="13548877">All four judges below have held that both the purpose in two express provisions of this bill repel the steelworkers attack on union democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.690" offset="13588270">I believe in exclusivity of union representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.140" offset="13622020">I believe in the union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.935" offset="13633201">I have worked for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.748" offset="13640515">But those things bring something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.982" offset="13657442">They bring a responsibility with them, and this provision, this stopping of the slightest help for those who would challenge an incumbent, those are not carrying out the responsibility and the favors and the held that the Congress of this country gave unions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.000" offset="13765485">There is a certain iron in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.063" offset="13773739">We are told that what the union did here is a terrible blow to democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.436" offset="13795264">But what the union did here is an expression of democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.621" offset="13808012">There is no debate about the fairness of the union's convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.198" offset="13822327">Delegates elected by the members from all over the country came, and overwhelmingly, by a ten to one margin, said we want this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.773" offset="13852629">Now, that is democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.960" offset="13861302">The question is whether Congress intended to stifle that democratic choice, and whether it constitutionally can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.457" offset="13891290">Mr. Rauh has recited in the last half hour facts about union elections that so diverge from the facts in this record and the facts about--</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.124" offset="13934027">Well, Mr. Gottesman, on that point, we asked you about independent expenditures, and you gave me quite a different impression than I get from reading Joint Appendix, 74.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.397" offset="14019081">It is rather strongly worded, his duty to stop that sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.879" offset="14044995">The union can't stop them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.958" offset="14049279">And I apologize for having forgotten that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.597" offset="14059833">It is important I think to remember the posture of the case, and the posture of this case is that summary judgment was granted to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.156" offset="14098076">So that while Mr. Rauh recites as fact that people can't get money from the members of the union, and the staff always supports the incumbents, the evidence in this record is quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.822" offset="14148753">Indeed, there is virtually nothing supporting what he is saying, but more importantly, there is a great deal supporting the other side.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.727" offset="14172368">Well, if you are talking about summary judgment, is there really any evidence in the record... I mean, in the sense that you would have after a case was tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.909" offset="14209148">There are substantial affidavits that there are numerous people who have unseated incumbents in steelworker elections relying solely or almost solely on member contributions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="3534.418" offset="14271111">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.653" offset="14272051">If we are right that 101(a)(2) doesn't create this right, we also moved to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.964" offset="14289292">And of course, the complaint didn't allege 101(a)(2), but I think we are entitled to have it treated as amended, since that is what the court of appeals relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.601" offset="14319908">Our position was they don't state a claim under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.615" offset="14331924">That is our first proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.474" offset="14339343">And if we are right about that, dismissal is the proper disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.020" offset="14357524">But if we are wrong about that and we are down to fighting about whether the facts are what Mr. Rauh says they are, there is not a fact he recited that can be accepted in the present posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.219" offset="14406321">Most of what he said has no record support; all of what he said is flatly contradicted by affidavits that show, as I say, that outsiders have defeated incumbents relying on contributions within the union; that show that Sadlowsky did not make a serious effort to raise money from the union because he did not have to, he had all the money he wanted from outsiders; that show that the staff frequently supports the opponents, sometimes unanimously supports the opponents of incumbents; that shows that the Staff are really just rank and filers, almost all of the staff are people who worked in the plant, worked their way up to local union positions, went on the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.656" offset="14556159">They are members just like everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.483" offset="14563369">And they have the same rights to participate and they have contractual protection against any harm being done to them because they support whoever they choose or choose not to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.229" offset="14606419">This record shows that 64 % of the staff did not support either candidate, at least financially in the 1977 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.195" offset="14638288">It also shows that the union has 1,300,000 members, all of whom are eligible contributors: that other candidates have had no trouble with in-plant solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.144" offset="14682069">The people who run for top office in the union... and the record shows this... aren't some person who doesn't know anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.828" offset="14704848">They are people who achieved some status, as this Court said in Buckley, they are incumbents of other offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.388" offset="14727000">In that capacity, whether local union, whether staff, in those capacities they have gotten to know throughout this union, they have the mechanism by which they can get fund raising within the union going.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.650" offset="14780081">The record also contains evidence of elections under this rule that successfully raised substantial money to oppose an incumbent.</text>
