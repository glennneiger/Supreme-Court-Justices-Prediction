            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="61.164" offset="380189">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Petitioner, Earl Enmund, has been sentenced by the state of Florida to be executed for the crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.251" offset="436509">Now, two factual determinations of the Florida Supreme Court surrounding Mr. Enmund's actual involvement in that crime are critical here, and I would like to take a moment to summarize those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.231" offset="480499">First, the Florida Supreme Court determined that Earl Enmund did not himself take life.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.074" offset="499829">Rather, it determined that Sampson Armstrong, Mr. Enmund's confederate in a robbery, killed both of the victims, that is, Mr. Thomas Kersey and Mrs. Eunice Kersey, in an exchange of gunfire that was initiated by Mrs. Kersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.441" offset="565240">The Florida Supreme Court determined that during these events and during the robbery, Petitioner was not on the scene but was 200 yards away in the get-away car.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.391" offset="605051">More importantly, the Florida Supreme Court secondly expressly determined that the killings committed by Sampson Armstrong were not intended or contemplated as a part of the robbery scheme with which Mr. Enmund had associated himself and had helped plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.384" offset="673074">Rather, the Florida Supreme Court, in its own words, determined that those killings by Sampson Armstrong</text>
            <text syncTime="147.097" offset="723960">"were spontaneous and were precipitated by the armed resistance of Mrs. Kersey. "</text>
            <text syncTime="148.518" offset="729602">again, at a time when Earl Enmund was 200 yards away, and was not at all able to take any part in that spontaneous decision by Sampson Armstrong to return Mrs. Kersey's fire.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.165" offset="832211">In fact, the prosecutor told the jury both in the opening argument and in the closing argument that it was not going to be able to tell them anything about the guns or even how many guns there were.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.052" offset="863767">They didn't know that.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.042" offset="951643">Well, that is unclear also, but there were at least Sampson Armstrong, Jeanette Armstrong and Earl Enmund, and possibly Ida Jean Shaw, and then there was Mr. and Mrs. Kersey at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.882" offset="1003052">One other fact that I should mention is that Sampson Armstrong told J.B. Neil, his friend, who testified at trial against Sampson, that both Sampson and Jeanette Armstrong had guns.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.430" offset="1149234">They just couldn't determine it, because those bullets were too injured to allow conclusive ballistics determinations.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_s_liebman" startTime="261.755" stopTime="559.180">
            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="261.755" offset="1182566">Mr. Kersey was shot twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.987" offset="1195522">Mrs. Kersey was shot six times.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.703" offset="1214331">They found a total of nine bullets, those eight plus an additional ninth bullet, but they could only do successful ballistics tests on five of the bullets.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.434" offset="1249230">Now, in order to affirm Petitioner's conviction of first degree murder on those findings that I just mentioned, the Florida Supreme Court found it necessary and said that it found it necessary to rely on two what it has called in the past constructive devices, and to establish murder, the court first relied on Florida's constructive malice doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.316" offset="1340763">Under that doctrine, a person who is engaged in a robbery who kills is conclusively presumed, despite any other evidence, to be... to have intended that death, and thus to be a murderer.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.498" offset="1393531">The court then applied Florida's accessorial rule under which all of the robbery confederates who are either actually or, as the Florida Supreme Court determined was actually the case here, are only constructively present at the time the killings took place are also conclusively presumed to have an intent to kill, and therefore to be murderers.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.021" offset="1475660">Now, I want to stress that under the Florida rule, including, and this is stated in the Pope case which is cited repeatedly by the Supreme Court in affirming Petitioner's conviction, and also the Hampton case, and both of those cases are cited on Page 13 of our opening brief, the Florida courts have clearly held that in a case in which the jury would find that there is no foreseeability that the deaths would occur, that there was no contemplation by the accomplices of any possible death, even in that kind of a case, Florida's felony murder rule and its accessorial rules apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.084" offset="1615885">Now, in this record, Mr. Enmund's principal submission, which we have set out in Point 1 of our opening brief, is that execution is an excessive and disproportionate punishment, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, for one who did not himself take life, attempt or assist in taking life, and for one who did not intend that life be taken by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.543" offset="1721733">Now, at the outset I want to make very clear that Petitioner's submission here does not in any way challenge Florida's authority to devise rules governing accessorial liability or its ability to define the crime of felony murder or to punish those crimes severely, but Petitioner's first submission does raise the single question of the constitutionality of inflicting the one punishment, the unique punishment of death on one who has not taken part in a design himself to take life or to have it taken by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.763" offset="1854540">And we believe that the answer to that question, that death is a disproportionate punishment in that situation, is mandated by this Court's prior decision, the logic of its decision in Coker versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.227" offset="1912427">In Coker, the Court decided a question that Gregg versus Georgia had left open, and that was whether there are certain crimes short of deliberate homicide committed by the defendant that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the states from punishing by death, and indeed, the Court determined in Coker that Ehrlich Coker could not constitutionally be executed for the serious, in fact, the often life-threatening crime of rape, even where that crime in that particular case had been carried out in part by the offender holding a knife to the victim's throat during the rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.775" offset="2046592">Now, the crucial point I want to make here is that in condemning Earl Enmund to death, the state of Florida has proved nothing more on his part than a degree of participation in the crime of robbery that is identical to Ehrlich Coker's degree of participation in the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.003" offset="2127571">Insofar as anything the two men did or intended or even foresaw, they are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.561" offset="2165815">Now, here it is true that two deaths occurred, but I want to stress, I think it is important for purposes of Eighth Amendment decision-making here that that was at the hands and at the decision of Sampson Armstrong, and as the Florida Supreme Court expressly determined, that was not by any design or act on Earl Enmund's part, apart from being himself a part of the robbery, and therefore the Florida Supreme Court, the Florida courts all the way along, the instructions, in order to link Mr. Enmund to those deaths, they could not rely on anything he did or intended, and they did not purport to.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.607" offset="2325998">Rather, they linked him to those deaths solely by virtue of the constructive malice and constructive presence devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.151" offset="2352120">Those are the only links, and those are the links that the Florida Supreme Court expressly relied on.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.180" offset="2372287">You say it would be irrational for reasonable jurors to have concluded that everybody involved in that automobile knew about the number of guns that were present and who had them?</text>

            <text syncTime="575.829" offset="2438847">Well, the first point, Your Honor, is that on the instructions given here, the jury was not asked to confront that point and made no finding on it, and the--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="584.576" offset="2473851">My question didn't go to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.545" offset="2481687">Suppose... Jurors often conclude things which are not covered by instructions, and they are permitted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.165" offset="2512198">Would it be irrational or unreasonable for a juror to conclude that everyone in that car knew that this was an armed enterprise?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_s_liebman" startTime="604.115" stopTime="791.853">
            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="604.115" offset="2552009">--I think, Your Honor, that on the proof that we have in this case, that would be a difficult inference for the jury to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.972" offset="2579385">I don't know if I can say it would be an irrational inference, but it would be extremely difficult, because the only time the state actually connected Mr. Enmund to those guns was two days later, when he participated in a plan with Sampson Armstrong and Ida Jean Shaw to dispose of the weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.918" offset="2647199">Now, we know something about the calibers.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.902" offset="2659111">We know that there was a.22-caliber gun, and that that belonged to Ida Jean Shaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.570" offset="2685756">She disposed of that weapon and said it was her gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.147" offset="2688159">She also said that the.38-caliber weapon that she disposed of was one that she had seen in the hands of either Sampson Armstrong or Jeanette Armstrong some time before these events occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.846" offset="2738941">So, all of the evidence is at least consistent, with the possibility that those guns were on the persons only of the Armstrongs and Mrs. Kersey, and that Petitioner didn't know, and of course the jury here was instructed that if there are two possible inferences that it can draw from the evidence, you know, equally strong, then it must draw the inference in favor of the defense, and I would suggest that that instruction here would make it quite difficult for the jury to determine that Earl Enmund knew something about the guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.756" offset="2858582">But, of course, in any event, the jury was not asked here to make any determination about the guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.847" offset="2882928">The state said it couldn't really prove very much about the guns, and it just didn't have to, because the felony murder rule that it was acting under allowed it not to have to prove that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.249" offset="2928486">And I want to stress that for purposes of criminal liability and for purposes of severe punishment, I have no doubt that these vicarious devices and these conclusive presumptions that the Florida Supreme Court relied upon are perfectly okay to establish a nexus between what the offender actually did and these killings, but here the punishment is death, and in that qualitatively different situation, the Eighth Amendment implies it requires that the courts apply qualitatively different standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.220" offset="3060456">And in particular, as this Court stated so recently in Eddings versus Oklahoma, what the Eighth Amendment requires in death penalty cases is a sensibility to the uniqueness of the individual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.245" offset="3128479">What this Court repeatedly has called in Woodson, Roberts, Lockett, a concern, a concern for the individual culpability of that offender for his particular offense, and for his particular character, and what we suggest here is that that crucial Eighth Amendment concern in death penalty cases for individual culpability simply will not permit the gap between what Earl Enmund actually did and intended here as a robbery and the Kerseys' deaths at the hands of Sampson Armstrong to be bridged by nothing more than what is really a legal fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.091" offset="3263898">In short, the Eighth Amendment requires that actual individual culpability be the touchstone of how we determine who lives and who dies.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="791.853" offset="3302977">Well, is it a legal fiction or is it an irrebuttable presumption that a participant in a felony which results in death has that consequence?</text>

            <text syncTime="802.535" offset="3345714">Well, let me explain why I call it that, because I did carefully use those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.643" offset="3354073">The Florida Supreme Court has stated that even in a case where it is in fact provable and the defendant could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not intend death, that he did not know that there was any reasonable likelihood of death, that no death was contemplated, even in that situation, the felony murder presumption, conclusive presumption of malice applies, and in that case, where the defendant could make that proof, it has to be a fiction, because the jury could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no intent, there was no malice, and yet they would be forced to find malice.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="842.347" offset="3504956">Well, isn't it in fact something a little different from a fiction, just a judgment by the state involved that if you participate in a robbery, and because a robbery is sufficiently likely to lead to a fatal killing, that you are going to be held accountable for the killing, too, without regard to your intent as to kill?</text>

            <text syncTime="862.277" offset="3584682">Well, Your Honor, that's why I say that that type of reasoning is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.993" offset="3603490">There is no constitutional wrong there so far as finding criminal liability or even punishing the person with a severe term of years, but where the problem comes in with that is in the Eighth Amendment area, where the death penalty is involved, because there individual culpability must be crucial, and we can't just say that because in most cases this would be true, we are going to presume that it is true in all cases.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="892.904" stopTime="906.149">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="892.904" offset="3707144">Yes, but I think the argument is aided by stripping away whatever there is of a fiction, and just looking at the, you know, what facts the state has proved and what reasons are traditionally held out for the felony murder doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.467" offset="6801400">Earl Enmund, in an attempt to alibi his involvement, went out and made a big record in the town there, the local town, of buying a.38 caliber pistol for defense two or three days after the murders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.704" offset="6926370">The Court should refuse to read an absolute intent requirement into the Eight Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.909" offset="7063147">Now, in the Florida Supreme Court, Petitioner argued this point, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.032" offset="7087702">"Absence of direct proof that the defendant intended to cause the death of the victim is highly relevant in determining the appropriate penalty. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.044" offset="7131692">Now, however, Petitioner is claiming that absence of proof of actual intent to kill should be an absolute constitutional bar to the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.587" offset="7169831">He is asking too much from the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.538" offset="7177668">Florida's position, as was reiterated in our brief numerous times, is that the Court should refrain from drawing a bright line in a case like this in an area which has traditionally been left to the state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.019" offset="7223643">Now, Petitioner counters with the fact that, well, death is different.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.329" offset="7248825">Yes, death is different, but it's different for the innocent victims as well as the defendant, and that is the precise reason, the precise reason this case is different from Coker v. Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.879" offset="9367042">Now, Petitioner has attempted to cloud his culpability in this case by making reference to the spontaneity of the crime, the fortuitousness of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.964" offset="9443425">Unfortunately for Petitioner, but more unfortunately for his victims, Earl Enmund's case is fatally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.619" offset="9465994">By his willful, reckless participation in a foreseeably dangerous felony involving deadly weapons, Petitioner took the risk that death might result, and once that risk came to fruition and once death did result, the rationale behind Coker is no longer constitutionally controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.205" offset="9536316">The best and the only solution is to make intent merely one of the numerous factors which make up the sentencing equation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.420" offset="9589188">This is what Lockett requires, and this is exactly what Florida's law has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.588" offset="9609877">Intent should be just a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.494" offset="9617505">Now, Petitioner in his reply brief has said that we have grudgingly admitted that intent can be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.054" offset="9643731">We would be trying to fool the Court if we said intent was not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.739" offset="9662435">But intent is not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.426" offset="9673198">Intent should not be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.473" offset="9677377">There is no requirement in the Eighth Amendment for intent before a death sentence can be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.924" offset="9695245">Now, in Coker, the Court set forth a two-pronged test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.516" offset="9717606">The first part of the test was whether a particular punishment contributed to the acceptable goals of punishment as recognized by Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.168" offset="9752192">The first part that needs to be discussed is deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.838" offset="9770896">Now, Petitioner has argued that one who does not intend death can't be deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.585" offset="9793883">He can't be deterred from what he didn't intend to commit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.132" offset="9800048">But Petitioner has missed the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.303" offset="9808721">The point is that Florida's law is designed to prevent the commission of the the underlying felony, the foreseeably dangerous underlying felony the natural and probable consequences of which is death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.922" offset="9863265">If there was no felony in this case, no attempted robbery, or no robbery, there wouldn't have been deaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.265" offset="9884580">If the death penalty is made unavailable in situations like this, shrewd, cunning criminals will insulate themselves from the death penalty by procuring less mentally gifted criminals to do their dirty work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.680" offset="9938288">That would defy common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.678" offset="9958246">That would be going against public policy of allowing the states to enforce their criminal justice systems and protect their citizens by criminal laws which need to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.800" offset="10002758">A second situation that could occur would be where a smart criminal procures a juvenile who, depending on what happens in Eddings, might not be eligible for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.855" offset="10058974">Again, this would be against public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.870" offset="10070990">A second goal of punishment which a death penalty in this type of situation achieves is moral outrage, or retribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.100" offset="10111950">Florida's law meets this goal, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.926" offset="10131281">Earl Enmund's moral guilt was presupposed by his participation in this violent felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.816" offset="10158762">He has been made fully responsible for what he has done, the old</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.641" offset="10182063">"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and a life for a life. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.156" offset="10184153">This theory of retribution allows society to strike back for Earl Enmund's deliberate act which upset the moral order of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.589" offset="10221874">In fact, a felony murder is even more reprehensible than the average, if you have an average premeditated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.930" offset="10247265">That is because the victim of a felony murder is randomly selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.929" offset="10259281">There is no rhyme or reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.366" offset="10265028">It happens to be the poor student who is working in a gas station at night, or the poor person that happens to be on duty at a convenience store on the late shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.722" offset="10302435">There is no reason for them to die, but it doesn't make any difference to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.266" offset="10332633">They are murdered whether they are felony murdered, premeditatedly murdered, or whatever theory you want to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.296" offset="10340678">Society is hurt the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.203" offset="10348306">The victim is still dead, and society has the right to strike back on the person who caused these deaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.354" offset="10380907">A final theory which Florida's law meets is incapacitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.756" offset="10422598">If a criminal who has killed once is executed, he can't kill again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.663" offset="10426151">Now, you might say that this doesn't come up very often, but just the week before last the Florida Supreme Court affirmed a death sentence for a prisoner who had been sent to prison for murder, and he had a life sentence, and he murdered again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.392" offset="10473067">If he had been executed that first time, no second murder would have occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.681" offset="11022265">Actually, I think it is Hardee County, Florida, where the murders were committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.283" offset="11080675">The federal statute I just mentioned would also allow the death penalty where an accomplice intentionally participates in an act in which there is a risk of death and the victim dies as a direct result of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.167" offset="11156221">The direct result question would be a jury question, but it would allow for a death sentence to be imposed in the context like Earl Enmund's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2759.025" offset="11171581">Also persuasive, but not controlling, is the model penal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.130" offset="11200002">The model penal code, as outlined by the brief filed by the Washington Legal Foundation in this case, specifically includes accomplices to robbery as persons who could be capitally punished if death occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.203" offset="11256322">The intent and recklessness is presumed if the murder is committed during a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.389" offset="11277116">As the Foundation pointed out, if the model penal code had been in effect in Florida when these murders occurred and when the trial occurred, Petitioner could have been sentenced to death under that model penal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.369" offset="11321002">Next, I would like to discuss Petitioner's argument that the Florida Supreme Court has eliminated the death sentence in cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.222" offset="11372411">Petitioner has cited, oh, eight or ten cases at the conclusion of his brief, but what Petitioner fails to tell this Court is that those cases all involved jury recommendations of life sentences which the trial court overruled and the Florida Supreme Court rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.920" offset="11427163">Petitioner's jury recommended a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.868" offset="11471049">Petitioner's second argument in his brief was that this record cannot support his death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.290" offset="11476691">This argument should not be persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.993" offset="11479513">The trial court specifically found, and the Florida Supreme Court upheld this finding, that Earl Enmund's involvement was major, not minor, as Earl Enmund would have you believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.582" offset="11517860">But for Earl Enmund, these murders would not have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.939" offset="11543251">The jury, the trial court, and the Florida Supreme Court all agreed that death was the appropriate sentence for Petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.177" offset="12436221">Therefore, the only reasonable inference which the trial court can make was that Earl Enmund was not in that car, since the person who was seen in the car had long hair long hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.971" offset="12475405">That is in Robert Davis's testimony, and that wasn't discussed by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.954" offset="12491392">I don't know why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.642" offset="12494109">Finally, Florida disagrees with Petitioner's assertion that he presented evidence in mitigation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.934" offset="12531307">The record is clear that he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.855" offset="12542905">Petitioner's attorney did make a brief statement in his closing argument concerning Earl Enmund's involvement, but in Florida as well as probably most of the other states, what an attorney says is not evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.632" offset="12594105">Even Petitioner's trial attorney recognized this when asked by the trial court during the sentencing phase if he had any evidence to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.924" offset="12627229">He replied, and I quote, "We have no evidence".</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.392" offset="12637051">That is Page 1,677 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.765" offset="12650634">I don't see how Petitioner can come into this Court and argue now that the Florida Supreme Court or the trial court refused to consider what he didn't present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.498" offset="12681563">Despite his failure to present evidence in the sentencing phase, it is clear from the Florida Supreme Court's opinion and the trial court's findings of fact that the entire record was considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.024" offset="12735585">If there had been any evidence in mitigation, it would have been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.959" offset="12755333">There was none in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.896" offset="12759095">Florida's legislative and judicial conclusions comport with all the principles previously enunciated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.797" offset="12802667">In short, there is no constitutional barrier to prevent the state of Florida from carrying out the death sentence which was ordered six years ago on this defendant for a crime which was committed nearly seven years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.731" offset="12846448">The state of Florida urges this Court, let the Constitution be controlling rather than individual notions of what is fair in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.180" offset="12892215">The Court must continue to allow the various state legislatures to make the laws and to allow these laws to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.440" offset="12941325">Crime needs to be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.815" offset="12942788">The states should be allowed to enforce their criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.405" offset="12969119">Based on this record and the facts of this case, Earl Enmund's death sentence should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="3217.105" offset="13003914">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.996" offset="13007467">To begin with, I was rather startled that Mr. Kaden argued or appeared to be arguing that Earl Enmund was inside that house, and that the trial court made the correct finding on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.471" offset="13085416">In the Supreme Court of Florida, the state of Florida took the following position about the facts of Mr. Enmund's participation in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.999" offset="13127526">I am reading from their brief on appeal at Page 33:</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.888" offset="13151036">"Appellant Enmund in this case, being constructively present some 200 yards away and aiding in the escape, was therefore a second degree principal, and therefore guilty under Florida's felony murder rule. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.133" offset="13204012">They argued there and they took the position that the facts were only enough to support exactly what the Florida Supreme Court found, that he wasn't at the house, that he was 200 yards away, and I just think that if the Court reviews the record, it will see that the Florida Supreme Court, whose findings are do respect, as this Court held, for example, in Sumner v. Mada so recently, that those findings are absolutely correct on the record, and the state took that position in the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.529" offset="13309651">Now, turning to Justice O'Connor's argument or question during my opponent's argument, I would like to refer the Court to Page 55 of the Joint Appendix, the tan Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.865" offset="13383003">On that page, the Florida Supreme Court finds that two of the four aggravating circumstances that the trial court had found were not present in the case, and then it cites the Elledge case in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.722" offset="13410380">The Elledge case is the Florida rule that if there are any aggravating circumstances that are rejected and there is any mitigating evidence, any mitigating circumstance at all, then you have to remand for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.467" offset="13465446">And what did the Florida Supreme Court say, having wiped out two of the aggravating circumstances in the case and then applying the Elledge rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.510" offset="13505570">It said, and I am quoting, and this is from the very last two sentences on the page, "The finding"... it's referring to the trial court's finding...</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.727" offset="13534409">"The finding that no mitigating circumstances were present was not error. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.099" offset="13555934">"Therefore, the sentence of death is appropriate, and we approve it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.705" offset="13594386">They found not that there was some mitigating circumstances or whatever, they found that there were no mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.672" offset="13606194">They say it no less than three times on that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.325" offset="13636809">Sandra Lockett helped plan the murder in the Lockett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.778" offset="13638690">She pointed out the store, the pawn shop that was robbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.340" offset="13648930">Sandra Lockett hid a gun from the police while the police were searching a taxicab she was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.042" offset="13663663">Sandra Lockett hid two of her cohorts in the attic when the police were searching her house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.696" offset="13686337">And yet this Court held, and even in Justice Blackmun's more narrow rule in the Lockett case, that the lack of involvement in the homicide and I am quoting Justice Blackmun's opinion there, it's</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.068" offset="13727820">"involvement in the homicide was a mitigating circumstance that if no other circumstance was considered had to be considered. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.377" offset="13761047">And here, I think, in black and white, at least three different occasions on Page 55, the court has said that there were no mitigating circumstances, that it did not consider those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.889" offset="13791036">Moving to a question that Your Honor, Chief Justice asked--</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.748" offset="13934500">But in any case, for the Court to turn dire consequences on whether there are mitigating circumstances but they are statutory or non-statutory, I think, would also violate the principle in Lockett that all of these mitigating circumstances have to be considered, but I would also point out that what the trial court found, and I believe that this is on Page 34, if I am not... well, it's on Page 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.578" offset="14069815">"The Court can find no mitigating circumstances as it applies to this Defendant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.171" offset="14084234">That is what the trial court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.796" offset="14086742">That is the finding that the Surpeme Court said was not in error, and based on which it affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.528" offset="14109625">If I could turn for just a moment to a question that the Chief Justice asked about a statute saying that guns would be enough, if guns were involved and everybody knew about it, could that be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.601" offset="14165945">My opponent also mentioned Senate bill 114 and the model penal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.928" offset="14179216">All of those examples, I want to point out, involve a subjective state of mind with regard to the homicide that was not proved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.456" offset="14217354">Now, we think the intent line is the best line, but there is also another line that would be a subjective state of culpability with regard to the homicide be it recklessness, serious... some sort of awareness of it, and that was not found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.264" offset="14272629">It would be enough under the model penal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.841" offset="14286840">It would be enough under Senate 114.</text>
