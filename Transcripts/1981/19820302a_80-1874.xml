            <text syncTime="12.355" offset="171567">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.682" offset="184942">The issue in this case is whether plaintiffs in 1983 actions can generally be required to exhaust administrative remedies, despite this Court's consistent and repeated holdings that such exhaustion is not required, despite clear congressional recognition of and reliance on those holdings, and despite the absence of any historical basis to support a change in this Court's longstanding construction of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.094" offset="282535">Unlike most cases that come before the Court, this case pronounced not a new issue, but an old, previously settled one and respondents have not come near to making the sort of showing required to justify a change in settled statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.681" offset="344916">The case is here more than three years after petitioner first filed a complaint in the Federal District Court in Florida under Section 1983 alleging unlawful employment discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.144" offset="394757">The plaintiff has sought injunctive relief and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.799" offset="409386">There have been no proceedings on the merits and no discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.954" offset="422029">The district court granted defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.640" offset="440733">The Fifth Circuit initially reversed that decision, relying on this Court's cases, but the court of appeals reheard the case en banc and decided that 1983 plaintiffs would henceforward be required to exhaust administrative remedies under traditional exhaustion standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.307" offset="503427">This Court's holdings to the contrary were distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.524" offset="516279">The court remanded for a hearing as to the adequacy of the particular remedies available to this plaintiff, and she thereupon sort certiorari here, and either summary reversal in light of recent legislation of which the Fifth Circuit had apparently not been aware, or plenary consideration which this Court granted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles S. Sims</label>
            <text syncTime="148.222" offset="715123">--I do not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.424" offset="719930">The rule against required exhaustion, which this Court has announced and adhered to as a matter of statutory construction, is, of course, not etched in stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.155" offset="758800">Our submission is that in light of congressional action in 1871 and more recently, that it is written into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.653" offset="788788">The question here is not one of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.683" offset="800909">Instead, it is what Congress has meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.946" offset="806029">The imposition of an exhaustion requirement onto Section 1983 would be a revision of that statute, and statutory revision is a matter for Congress, not for the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.459" offset="848034">I plan to address here the three principal reasons why exhaustion cannot be required under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.111" offset="874679">First, because of this Court's cases in stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.361" offset="887636">Second, because of recent congressional action; and third, because it is violative of the intention of the 42nd Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.577" offset="912504">Of course, this Court's non-exhaustion precedents do not themselves prevent the court from changing its mind in deciding that it has misconstrued the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.980" offset="946150">But neither can they simply be ignored, as respondents have ignored them.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.900" offset="961824">They form the background against which this case must be decided, and they impose a heavy burden of justification on those who would change the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.490" offset="992126">The Court has held in six cases, all either unanimous or eight to one, that exhaustion cannot be required under 1983 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.488" offset="1024099">It has repeated that holding in eight additional cases without qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.174" offset="1042908">Just this term, in Fair versus McNary, every member of the Court subscribed to that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.312" offset="1063492">And two terms ago, in Board of Regents versus Tomanio, when the court held that state statutes of limitations would not be tolled pending exhaustion, the court reasoned that such tolling would be appropriate only where... as was not the case under 1983... Congress itself had required resort to administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.133" offset="1138725">In short, the rule against required exhaustion has not just been frequently repeated and applied; it is part of the fabric of this Court's 1983 jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.833" offset="1173520">Moreover, their construction was not lightly reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.941" offset="1185954">Pertinent history for the 1871 Congress was before the court in McNeese, as it had been somewhat more fully before nearly the same court two terms before in Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.406" offset="1227855">The consequences of the rule were fully pointed out by Justice Harlan dissenting in McNeese and Damico.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.356" offset="1251574">And Judge Friendly's famous attack on the rule in Eisen versus Eastman was squarely before this Court at least in Carter versus Stanton in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.883" offset="1285742">The Indiana officials in that case relied squarely on Eisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.350" offset="1299639">Arguments based on Eisen were before this Court at oral argument, and Eisen itself was being fully considered by the court in another case that term, its other principal holding being reversed in Lynch versus Household Finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.643" offset="1344779">Beyond their significance as precedent, however, McNeese and its progeny assume an overriding importance here, because Congress has accepted and relied on those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.421" offset="1383858">Even if the court's original construction in McNeese were dubious, congressional knowledge of that decision and acquiescence in it would require that further alterations be made by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.433" offset="1427952">Significantly, although Congress was plainly aware of that rule, it did not seek to alter it when it amendment 1983 in 1979 for the first time in a century to reverse this Court's somewhat restrictive decision in District of Columbia versus Carter, although Congress did re-emphasize the vital role of 1983... and I quote from the Conference Report...</text>
            <text syncTime="346.393" offset="1507783">"in providing a neutral federal forum for resolution of civil rights complaints. "</text>
            <text syncTime="352.906" offset="1533801">As this Court has held in United States versus Rutherford and in the Red Lion case, once an authoritative statutory construction has been brought to the attention of Congress and Congress has not sought to change that construction, although amending the statute in another respect, then presumably the legislative intention was correctly discerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.396" offset="1615825">But retention of the rule is required here for reasons far stronger than simple congressional acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.332" offset="1639544">Congress has not just acquiesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.441" offset="1648008">It has built and relied upon the rule in a way that precludes its reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.751" offset="1665249">Acting with the full knowledge that 1983 plaintiffs could not, under present law, be generally require to exhaust administrative remedies, Congress passed a law a year and a half ago authorizing exhaustion in certain 1983 actions under narrow and specified conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.370" offset="1731704">In Section 7 of the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 USC 1997e, Congress authorized courts to defer consideration of some 1983 cases for a maximum of 90 days, in suits brought by certain adults convicted of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.521" offset="1796279">The statute applies only to those who are in institutions which have adopted particular grievance resolution procedures in compliance with minimum procedures set forth by Congress and promulgated in somewhat greater detail by the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.639" offset="1856779">Four important points stand out from the legislation history of 1997e, and from its design.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.028" offset="1882274">First, the legislative history makes absolutely clear that Congress knew the non-exhaustion rule was settled law.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.852" offset="1909650">Sponsors repeatedly called it settled law.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.149" offset="1918741">Representative Kastenmeier said that the statute was necessary to permit... that was his word... exhaustion which was not allowed under current law.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.208" offset="1951028">And the Conference Report used similar language.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.238" offset="1959179">Representative Wiggins, one of the Republic sponsors of the bill, indicated that some in Congress would have preferred a broader rule, but he acknowledged the impossibility of mustering a majority in Congress to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.422" offset="2003900">Second, Congress was not just looking at a small portion of a problem without attention to 1983 generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.308" offset="2035456">The general problem of 1983 filings in federal courts was a major focus of congressional concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.916" offset="2061892">Congress knew that prison filings which this Court had held and were wording, were subject to the same standards as all other 1983 cases under current law with the largest, single category of 1983 cases burdening the federal courts, and by far the most burdensome because of their generally pro se nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.517" offset="2136289">Aware of that entire problem, Congress decided to deal with it piecemeal, one step at a time, by attacking its major source.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.139" offset="2166800">Third, Congress was extremely and deliberately selective.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.918" offset="2185817">It did not require exhaustion for all 1983 cases, or even for all 1983 cases that generally fell within the purview of the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.118" offset="2226672">Instead, only certain claims, those of adults convicted of crime, or in particular institutions which had adopted particular demanding grievance resolution procedures, were subject to exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.425" offset="2275887">And even as to them, only those complaints having to do with conditions of confinement were subject to exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.156" offset="2302846">Congress was thus not hostile to the rule generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.936" offset="2317892">Instead, it made a small exception to the rule because it decided that prisoner cases posed a unique problem warranting a unique solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.464" offset="2348090">Finally, and most importantly, Congress built on the non-exhaustion rule for its own special purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.384" offset="2371704">Congress rejected a proposal to subject prisoners to general exhaustion requirements such as those imposed on 1983 by the Fifth Circuit below, and last year by the Seventh Circuit in a case which was vacated by this Court, Jenkins versus Brewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.331" offset="2431472">The motivating concern was not federalism, or even having as many 1983 cases as possible efficiently resolved at the local administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.061" offset="2470447">Traditional exhaustion, which Congress rejected, would have accomplished that.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.621" offset="2488628">Instead, Congress used this new exhaustion requirement for some 1983 cases, as an inducement, a carrot you will, to achieve particular substantive goals as a matter of national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.867" offset="2537634">The non-exhaustion rule is thus not just the background against which this case must be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.413" offset="2555815">It was the principal justification for 1997e, and indispensable for its effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.488" offset="2580161">Congress would not have passed 1997e if exhaustion was already permitted under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.299" offset="2603358">More importantly, reading a general exhaustion requirement into 1983 would render the statute a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.748" offset="2629167">Only on the premise that 1983 cases cannot already be subject to exhaustion does the inducement mechanism that Congress created make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.198" offset="2663022">The states have no reason to adopt the particular procedures Congress meant to foster if their 1983 prison cases are already subject to exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.836" offset="2697504">In short, we think that 1997e makes this case even easier than its predecessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.114" offset="2722686">The legislative history shows far more than passivity and silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.706" offset="2737001">Instead, it shows that Congress has accepted the rule and built on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.408" offset="2751838">Congress has put itself directly in the business of deciding when and to what extent and under what conditions exhaustion will be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.154" offset="2786842">In these circumstances, further alteration of the rule is plainly a matter for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.824" offset="2805441">As the court held in the Alyeska Pipeline case, when Congress begins making an exception to a general rule, even a general rule which is completely judiciously created, further adjustments should be left to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.209" offset="2855074">Whatever the needs for courts to engage in interstitial adjustment with a hundred-year old statute untouched by Congress and unconstrued by the courts, surely the courts need not and should not intervene once Congress has placed a problem on its agenda and begun addressing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.860" offset="2921634">By adopting an exhaustion requirement in reliance on the very policy considerations that Congress is in the current business of weighing, the Fifth Circuit usurped the legislative rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.887" offset="3573755">Read against the background of this Court's cases, we think that 1997e is controlling because even if the court got 1983 completely wrong in McNeese, the fact is that Congress has relied on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.585" offset="3620566">As the court said in similar circumstances in Cannon against University of Chicago, when Congress acts in reliance on one of this court's statutory constructions, the question is no longer whether Congress misperceived the law, but rather, what its perception was.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.533" offset="3680335">But this is not a case where the court needs to perpetuate its own mistakes to give effect to more current legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.716" offset="3705099">The fact is that the court got 1983 right the first six times around, as the lopsided decisions in those cases should suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.324" offset="3735505">Respondents argue only that the 42nd Congress could not have said anything on the matter one way or the other because in their view, there was no law concerning exhaustion in the federal courts as of 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.054" offset="3782421">Their argument misconceives both the state of the law in 1871 and the principal themes of the legislative debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.816" offset="3809484">First, the notion of exhaustion was not unknown to the 42nd Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.503" offset="3828188">The very year that Congress passed 1983 in United States against Clyde, this Court had held that federal courts were without any power to require exhaustion unless Congress had expressly done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.559" offset="3876462">In another case that year, the Collector against Hubbard, the court there applied a statutory exhaustion requirement, but indicated that if Congress had not expressly provided that requirement by statute, the court would have been powerless to impose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.803" offset="3933409">In fact, Congress had imposed exhaustion requirements in 1857, 1866, 1868 and 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.394" offset="3963815">In short, there was clear exhaustion law in 1871, and the law was no exhaustion unless Congress had expressly provided for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.775" offset="4049288">And for that purpose, I think the court needs to focus on what the law was in 1871, and not what it later became.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.302" offset="4111355">It just focused on general principles which the judiciary had established by then governing exhaustion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.299" offset="4139358">With respect, Your Honor, the court in the Bethlehem versus Myer case paid very close attention to the particular administrative proceeding that Congress had established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.326" offset="4175512">And as one of its principal justifications for applying the exhaustion rule in that case, it said that it was obviously consistent with what Congress did, and an aid to the accomplishment of Congress's purpose; that is, that Congress had set up deliberately a particular administrative proceeding, and the court was only helping Congress along by making sure that it was not bypassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.162" offset="4254819">That is plainly not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.036" offset="4262343">As with immunities and the res judicata questions which this Court has focused on in previous years, Congress in 1871 should be understood to have acted against the background of the settled law at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.547" offset="4312393">Second, as to the debates themselves, not only is the conclusion of McNeese not plainly wrong, as would be required to reverse the non-exhaustion rule, it was plainly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.057" offset="4358473">The debates in 1871 strongly suggest that if an exhaustion requirement had been placed before Congress, it would have been squarely rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.851" offset="4389611">The debates' responses have repeatedly described their goal as providing a prompt federal judicial remedy in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.722" offset="4429108">Representative Elliot explained that 1983 provided for, quote, "the immediate jurisdiction" of the federal courts without, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.000" offset="4466202">"the appeal or agency of the state. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.046" offset="4474352">Opponents like Representative Storm opposed 1983 precisely because it takes the whole question away from the states in the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.230" offset="4507162">Senator Blair explained that Section 1 superseded state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.822" offset="4525448">Representative Kerr complained that it transferred jurisdiction from state tribunals to those of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.257" offset="4551257">Representative Arthur complained that it swallowed up state institutions, tribunals and functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.036" offset="4574349">Representative Swan, another opponent, focused on precisely this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.862" offset="4589605">He complained that it ignored state tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.439" offset="4603920">Section 1 was the centerpiece of a vast transformation of power and of federalism enacted by Congress after the Civil War that this Court has frequently reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.576" offset="4640491">The very model that Congress relied on, Prigg versus Pennsylvania, as Justice Stevens pointed out in Monell, makes clear how inconsistent required exhaustion would be with what Congress was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.166" offset="4682810">Under Prigg, critical federal rights... in that case, the rights of southern slaveholders... could be enforced directly in federal court without the interference of state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.380" offset="4723665">After the Civil War, of course, Congress was interested in a very different set of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.269" offset="4739234">But for safety's sake, and to make sure that its meaning would not be lost, it relied on the Prigg model with its direct enforcement of federal constitutional rights free from any opportunity of state interference, obstruction, hindrance of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.091" offset="4798584">Justice Story's opinion for the Court in Prigg said that it would make impermissible even state laws that would complement congressional legislation by auxiliary provisions for the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.571" offset="4844455">The 42nd Congress intended to provide for the prompt federal judicial protection of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.506" offset="4868175">Subsequent congresses have not waivered from that goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.708" offset="4881027">The Court should give effect to that choice, to its own decisions and to the subsequently expressed will of Congress... the rule 1983 itself does not generally require exhaustion... and reverse the judgment below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1330.854" offset="5445585">We are here asking this Court to affirm the decision of the Fifth Circuit below and its adoption of a flexible exhaustion rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.441" offset="5499920">We contend that this is a procedure with a relief oriented result without substantial denial of anyone's rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.894" offset="5973781">In this case, they provided for them statutorily.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.733" offset="6009099">And I think there is an indication there of their desire to require exhaustion in these circumstances and to provide a mechanism by which the courts... I mean, the states, and the agencies that are concerned to address those particular problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.164" offset="6234901">The issue that we responded to was... on the certiorari... as to whether or not the exhaustion rule should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.300" offset="6271368">But yes, there is an 11th amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.471" offset="6288086">However, we feel that this particular issue of exhaustion transcends the Patsy and the state of Florida, and is one that should be addressed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.402" offset="6359766">And it does not... the adoption of a flexible exhaustion remedy does not require the overruling of prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.366" offset="6403652">I will not bore you with a recitation of those, but they are outlined in both the amicus brief that we filed... or that was filed on behalf of respondent, as well as an analysis of the case law and the opinions of this Court and the Fifth Circuit below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.857" offset="6485572">And to respond to Justice Blackmun's question as to why the members of the original panel may have reversed themselves, I would suggest that a possible reason is that there was an opportunity for them to be persuaded that exhaustion or no exhaustion is not required, and it is not an ironclad rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.767" offset="6589226">And that by analyzing the previous decisions of this case, you can come to the conclusion that exhaustion may be a procedural rule that can be adopted by the Court and is consistent with the plain language of the statute itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2488.731" offset="10077095">It is a deferral, and it does permit administrative agencies to address those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.616" offset="10124638">I indicated that it does not require overruling prior decisions, and I think that the commentaries in Chicago and Harvard Law Review articles that we have cited in our brief are indications of how the Fifth Circuit reached the result that they did below.</text>
