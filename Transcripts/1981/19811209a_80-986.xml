            <label>Ms. Susan K. Krell</label>
            <text syncTime="53.135" offset="340109">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.168" offset="340214">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the validity of regulations promulgated by the then Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, now the Department of Education, pursuant to Sections 901 and 902 of the Education Amendments of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.881" offset="423074">It is the Petitioners' position that Section 901 was drafted with an unmistakable focus on the beneficiaries of federal financial assistance and not as a general prohibition on discriminatory conduct by recipients of such federal financial assistance, and thus the regulations in question are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.678" offset="510219">I will briefly present the facts in the North Haven case, and counsel for Trumbull will address the facts in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.716" offset="538431">The legal issues are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.183" offset="548253">The North Haven case arose when a former teacher who had quit her job applied for an open position and a different female applicant was hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.606" offset="585974">The rejected applicant filed charges of sex discrimination in employment with the EEOC and with HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.629" offset="618052">She also filed a federal court suit under Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, under 43 US Code 1983, and under Title 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.837" offset="662878">When HEW attempted to investigate her charge, the Board of Education pointed out that it believed HEW did not have jurisdiction over general employment practices, and that several district courts had so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.596" offset="717944">HEW, however, persisted, thus necessitating the North Haven Board filing a suit in district court in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.283" offset="748664">Judge Ellen B. Burns granted North Haven's motion for summary judgment, and held the regulations in question void, invalid, and of no effect whatsoever, and granted an injunction prohibiting further investigation by HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.210" offset="808328">The Trumbull litigation followed a similar path, and the Department of Justice appealed both cases to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, where they were consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.149" offset="844168">The cases were held in abeyance pending a decision by this Court on three petitions for writs of certiorari filed by Justice Department from three court of appeals decisions that, similar to Judge Ellen Burns' decision, had held the regulations invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.641" offset="902055">When those petitions were denied, the cases were reactivated and heard by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.379" offset="925043">At that time there were 15 court decisions in various district courts and courts of appeals, all holding these regulations invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.151" offset="960152">The Second Circuit, however, reversed the decision of the district court and upheld the validity of those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.239" offset="988468">It is our position that an analysis of the legislative scheme of Title 9 in its entirety, of the statutory language of Sections 901 and 902, and the legislative history all establish that employees in general are not among the class protected by Section 901.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.402" offset="1069135">The Department of Education has recently indicated its agreement with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.789" offset="1090659">The genesis of what became Title 9 were hearings, extensive hearings held before the House of Representatives in 1970, and at that time two problems were brought to its attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.530" offset="1141650">One was sex discrimination in employment against women employed in educational institutions, and at that time Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act explicitly excluded women... excluded educational institutions from its parameters.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.660" offset="1218137">The Equal Pay Act at that time excluded people in positions of executive, professional, and academic.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.433" offset="1249275">That would also work to the detriment of women faculty members of educational institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.753" offset="1274561">So, thus there was one very special problem of women employees of educational institutions who were victims of sex discrimination and who were not protected by Title 7 of the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.978" offset="1323463">Another problem that was brought to Congress's attention was the problem of student beneficiaries who were also or might also be victims of sex discrimination and who were not protected by Section 601 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a section that protected beneficiaries of federal financial assistance from race, color, or national origin discrimination, but did not prohibit sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.212" offset="1428370">Growing out of these hearings was the bill that became Title 9, which very explicitly addressed the problem of women employees by amending Title 7 to remove that exemption for employees of educational institutions, and by amending the Equal Pay Act to remove the exemption for academic, professional, and executive positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.059" offset="1519799">So, employees of educational institutions now have federal forums, federal agencies that could investigate their claims and could go into federal court pursuant to those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.866" offset="1567028">The problems of student beneficiaries were addressed in what became Section 901 of Title 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.205" offset="1596390">The section that was enacted prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.943" offset="1615303">That Section 901 language was chosen over other proposals that had been suggested to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.399" offset="1657099">One proposal by the Department of Justice had suggested that instead of amending Title 7 in the Equal Pay Act to protect employees of educational institutions, HEW should be given that jurisdiction, and it proposed what would have been comparable to Section 901(a), a general prohibition against discrimination of beneficiaries, and explicitly would have given jurisdiction over employment to HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.982" offset="1763469">That proposal, however, was not adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.918" offset="1775172">Similarly, Senator McGovern had proposed a bill that would have first banned general discrimination against beneficiaries in educational programs, and again would have explicitly covered employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.792" offset="1822715">Those proposals were not adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.178" offset="1832224">What was adopted was the scheme to protect employees under Title 7 in the Equal Pay Act, and to protect student beneficiaries under Section 901.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.366" offset="1872975">The statute then is clearly addressed to those beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.837" offset="1890842">The exceptions to Section 901 are also all addressed to the student relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.007" offset="1919577">They address admissions to educational institutions, certain programs or activities that would affect students, or exempt institutions in their entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.232" offset="1960433">Nothing related to employment is under Section 901.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.451" offset="1977360">When Congress does address employment, it has put certain exceptions into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.938" offset="1999303">Title 7, for example, makes an exception for bona fide occupational qualification, or for a national security exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.710" offset="2034411">Those exceptions were missing from the Section 901 exceptions, further indication that employment was not covered in that general prohibition to protect students.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.068" offset="2079760">The HEW regulations in question, however, go much further than the statutory language.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="494.488" offset="2105464">Ms. Krell, how do you deal with the fact that Title 9 was patterned after Title 6, and Title 6 had an express provision excluding employment practices from its coverage, and a similar section proposed in Title 9 was removed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="susan_k_krell" startTime="517.670" stopTime="591.018">
            <label>Ms. Susan K. Krell</label>
            <text syncTime="517.670" offset="2198251">Title 9 in its entirety did address employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.572" offset="2209850">Sections 906 and 908 of Title 9 were the sections that amended Title 7 and amended the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.161" offset="2248197">To have a Section 904 in it prohibiting agency action if there was employment discrimination would have been inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.684" offset="2278290">So therefore it was eliminated in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.553" offset="2293755">But I think it is also important to remember that Section 604 is not an exclusion from coverage under Section 601.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.010" offset="2335551">It was instead a clarification of what Senator Humphrey had said had always been intended by the language of Section 601 on which Section 901 was patterned.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.168" offset="2384243">Further, as we note in our brief, Representative O'Hara had said that what they had done in preparing Title 9 was take a copy of Title 6 and just cut and paste it, mark out Section 601 and make 901, mark out 604 and make 904, but when you took that and added to it the amendments to Title 7 in the Equal Pay Act, it made no sense whatsoever, and thus it was dropped out.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.491" offset="2529484">It is not, because the Justice Department apparently has not gone along with the proposal of the Department of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.097" offset="2559890">President Carter had delegated his authority that was given to him under Section 902 to approve the regulations promulgated pursuant to 901 to the Attorney General, and when the Department of Education had proposed a revision of the regulations along the lines we have been discussing, apparently that was not agreed to by Justice, because right after we saw that letter, we got the Justice Department's brief, which indicates it intends to pursue this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.197" offset="3412318">They very explicitly put into the very first regulation in question that general prohibition on employment discrimination, which had been rejected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.604" offset="3449935">They further, recognizing that if employment was to be covered, there were certain situations in which there had to be exceptions, put in a bona fide occupational qualification into the regulations, which had also been missing from the statutory language.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.992" offset="3579502">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I represent the Trumbull Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.979" offset="3603430">After the Trumbull Board of Education declined to renew the contract of a non tenured guidance counselor, Linda Potz, Ms. Potz commenced seven different actions and proceedings in various forums, including a claim under the Subpart E regulations promulgated by HEW under Title 9, and so, we too commenced an action seeking to declare the Subpart E regulations to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.397" offset="3717115">Ms. Krell has described how the structure of the statute shows clearly an intent by Congress to regulate employment by its amendments to the Equal Pay Act, and Title 7, and on the other hand to address beneficiaries by Section 901, and that analysis is strongly buttressed by an analysis of the derivation and legislative history of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.730" offset="3822441">As this Court pointed out in Cannon, Section 601 was the basis of Section 901.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.720" offset="3850444">Title 9 was derived from Title 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.005" offset="3863505">And when President Kennedy first proposed Title 6 in 1963, he proposed a Title 6 which would have covered employment expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.711" offset="3902375">However, the committee later deleted that language, and noted that employment was now being covered under Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.101" offset="3951904">Once that coverage of employment was deleted from Title 6, both the floor leaders and the Justice Department, which was the principal proponent of the legislation, went out of their way to make clear the intention that Title 7... Title 6 was generally not intended to cover employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.199" offset="4036331">For example, a Justice Department memorandum stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="980.401" offset="4049079">"The mere fact that an aid recipient violated Title 7 would not itself warrant termination of aid. "</text>
            <text syncTime="987.989" offset="4079486">"Moreover, the agency administering the aid would not adopt a non discrimination in employment provision in connection with its aid program unless assistance to employment was one of the purposes of the program. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.147" offset="4128073">As Ms. Krell pointed out, this all occurred before the Section 604 language was ever added to the statute and when they did add Section 604 to the statute, Senator Humphrey went out of his way to make clear that</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.740" offset="4186483">"We have expressed in specific language what has always been intended. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.192" offset="4204246">In other words, Section 604 did not change the meaning of Section 601.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.509" offset="6189553">I turn first to the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.861" offset="6194986">On its face, it clearly includes employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.730" offset="6206480">It says no person shall be subjected to discrimination, and person clearly includes employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.383" offset="6233020">Title 9's kinship to Title 6 has been noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.452" offset="6249321">Title 6 does contain the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.804" offset="6258725">Title 6 does not pertain to employment, but Title 6 contains this express disclaimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.874" offset="6278996">Title 9 does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.508" offset="6285579">I recognize the argument that my opponents have made that 604 in Title 6 was just there for purposes of clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.514" offset="6321628">I will simply refer to Pages 34 and 35 by brief, and note that that issue is far from clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.320" offset="6348795">But analysis should not tarry there, because in any event, even if it was only in the statute for purposes of clarification, once you put a 604 clarifier onto a 601 basic prohibition, then any future Congress that wants to prohibit discrimination by using the 601 prototype needs to use the clarifier with it, because once the clarifier has been used, the defect becomes a procedure of art, if you will, and it must be used if the purpose is to exclude employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.445" offset="6501350">The case here is, of course, much stronger, because a Section 604 counterpart was included by the House version of the 1972 Act and taken out in conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.119" offset="6552028">The legislative history concerning the reason for that deletion is short, but equally clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.756" offset="6578568">The conference report devotes two sentences to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.458" offset="6589330">The first sentence describes the difference between the House and Senate version, and the second sentence states simply, "The House recedes".</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.230" offset="6624439">Now, in response to a question by Justice O'Connor, there was suggested a different reason for the deletion of Section 904 than the one given by the conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.903" offset="6659130">It is suggested that the reason for that change was simply to correct a drafting mistake because the bill was obviously inapplicable, or rather, the disclaimer was obviously inapplicable, and it was, to other parts of the 1972 amendment, namely, that part that extended the coverage of Title 9 and the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.649" offset="6746170">This is an inadequate explanation for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.768" offset="6758604">The first is that receding and correcting are two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.755" offset="6782532">The conference knew which it was doing and said which it was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.326" offset="6800818">The conference report does not say that the conferees picked up a mistake, and nowhere in the legislative history is there even the slightest hint that what they were doing was to correct a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.384" offset="6849092">The language that they used was the language that says that there was a substantive difference between the Senate and the House, and that on that issue it was the Senate version that prevailed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.534" offset="6961628">If you look at it from the standpoint... in recognition of the fact that whereas from 1972... from 1970 to 1972 there were four... three or four efforts, depending on how you count, to include some kind of guarantee in the civil rights laws of the United States providing against discrimination against women in education, and much of the legislative history that is quoted from and that might imply therefore some confusion comes from those earlier efforts, the 1970 and the 1971 efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.461" offset="7121393">The legislative history that really counts the most occurred all on one single day, and it consists of statements by one Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.369" offset="7173010">The case probably is not unique in this respect, but it certainly is distinctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.921" offset="7187221">Now, the reason that the statements by Senator Bayh on that particular day are so important is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.475" offset="7213448">The version that eventually prevailed was the Senate version.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.879" offset="7235077">That is the one that became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.580" offset="7241869">The Senate version was passed on the same day that it was introduced by Senator Bayh as an amendment to an existing Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.419" offset="7277187">It didn't go through committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.903" offset="7283143">So that introduction, debate, and final Senate passage all occurred on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.709" offset="7318356">And as a consequence, the views of Senator Bayh are the only views that were expressed in the legislative history, and his views really are the legislative history, because of the peculiar way that this particular bill was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.655" offset="10094127">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I represent the private respondent in this case, Linda Potz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.076" offset="10123802">Three years ago, after an investigation, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare found that the Trumbull Board of Education had violated Title 9 when it demeaned Ms. Potz before her colleagues and students, when it asked her to falsify a report which would have shown unequal services to female students, and when it terminated her employment, leaving female junior high school students without a female guidance counselor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.410" offset="10225157">The Trumbull Board of Education complains that Ms. Potz has pursued multiple remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.664" offset="10258176">I suggest that the record shows that some of her proceedings merely addressed gross irregularities in the termination proceedings, and certainly no inference should be drawn from those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.805" offset="10302793">Ms. Potz's complaint of discrimination went in the very first instance to the agency which has special expertise concerning education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.660" offset="10342186">It went to HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.095" offset="10347933">Only after the district court had enjoined the Title 9 employment regulations did Ms. Potz resort to Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.401" offset="10389102">Justice O'Connor has expressed interest in why private litigants would be interested in complaining to HEW rather than to the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.276" offset="10428599">The reason for that is that the EEOC has no special expertise concerning the education setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.930" offset="10455244">It has no particular knowledge of the ways in which that setting, in which decisions in that setting may differ.</text>

            <text syncTime="2648.053" offset="10719708">I am suggesting only that there may be a superior familiarity of HEW, because it deals with education all of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.973" offset="10751368">The other reason for resort to HEW is that the EEOC, as this Court knows, has labored under an enormous burden of a case load which it cannot keep up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.197" offset="10796299">The record indicates in this case HEW was able to come in, do a thorough investigation, and come up with findings within a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.386" offset="10829108">That is a very substantial difference, and since this Court has shown great interest in the idea of resolving these problems at the administrative level, it is a difference of which note should be taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.021" offset="11039655">However, the remedies offered under Title 9 can also be attuned finely to the perception by HEW that employment discrimination is having an impact on students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.413" offset="11097229">It has been brought to this Court's attention that there is a vast body of social science literature indicating that there is a real lesson to students when female teachers are discriminated against.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.859" offset="11286983">I am suggesting that the reason that Title 9 governs employment is because the employment does have an effect on students, and that that effect can be adjusted by the administrative agency which knows about that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.735" offset="11342467">The present change of position by the administering agency is not really germane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.175" offset="11376217">The standard of review here is not what the agency's philosophy is now, and it is not what other courts' philosophy might have been as to an efficient administrative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.332" offset="11428880">The flaw with the Alvo, the Romeo, the Seattle cases are all that these courts decided to look into how they thought this regulation should best be enacted, not according to the standard of review which this Court has said is germane to administrative regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.044" offset="11499724">As recently as last month, the court decided in Federal Election Commission versus Democratic Senatorial Campaign Commission that an administrative action is valid as long as it is not inconsistent with the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.005" offset="11567538">As the Solicitor General has indicated, there was a statutory purpose here to avoid the use of federal funds to support discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.677" offset="11602228">This Court has so found in Cannon versus University of Chicago, that one of the purposes of Title 9 was to keep those who accept federal largesse from using it in a discriminatory manner, and the view that these regulations should be inspected as to their efficiency is simply one which does not comport either with this recent case I have just cited or with the Mourning case or the other precedents from this Court which show deference to administrative regulations and to the contemporaneous view of the agency which accepts the mandate of interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.986" offset="11763456">There is no confusion by Senator Bayh when he addressed the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.342" offset="11796893">The division in his remarks was not, as the petitioners suggest, a division between remedies for faculty members and remedies for students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.964" offset="11831375">Rather, the division was, remedies concerning recipients of federal funds and remedies concerning other kinds of educational institutions which did not receive funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.988" offset="11879440">I would point out that the record does not permit any inquiry into the program specificity question because despite Ms. Potz's effort to make a record concerning infection of the educational program and the loss of equal services to students, the district court enjoined all of the regulations on their face, and that this is not therefore an instance in which program specificity is really raised as an issue to be decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.441" offset="11997304">There is no indication in the legislative history or in the language of the statute that Title 7 and the Equal Pay Act were ever intended to be the exclusive remedies, and this Court has recognized the validity of overlapping remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.636" offset="12062088">There is no reason for the Court to depart from that recognition in this case whatever its own view of efficiency might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.473" offset="12093435">The question is whether at the time of enactment, with broad language which contained no exemption concerning employment, it was proper for the Department of HEW to include regulation of employment because of its expertise in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.268" offset="12164593">The Court in reviewing other discrimination statutes has taken note of departures from prior models.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.790" offset="12202731">In the context of age discrimination, the Court has said that where Title 7 is abandoned and different procedures are engrafted, that difference will be respected, and the change from the Section 604 model of Title 6 must similarly be given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.351" offset="12280890">I urge then that the Court affirm what the Second Circuit's view has been, and I suggest that the number of court decisions is of nowhere near as much significance as the validity of the reasoning, and in this case the application of the traditional standard for judicial review of administrative actions favors upholding those regulations as enacted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul E. Knag</label>
            <text syncTime="3062.967" offset="12379424">Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to correct several things that were said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.535" offset="12397709">First of all, it was suggested that back pay is awardable under Title 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.820" offset="12414846">I would simply point out, although that is not an issue in this case, several courts have now held that damages are not awardable under Title 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.942" offset="12455283">I would also like to get to the statements by the Solicitor General concerning his two big points about why the legislative history shows that Congress intended to cover employment under Section 901.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.868" offset="12514947">Now, the fact is that Senator Bayh doesn't state one way or the other whether he intended employment to be covered exclusively under Title 7 and the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.861" offset="12574924">The fact is also that the Solicitor General made an error when he was quoting from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.884" offset="12607107">At one point he referred to a statement by Senator Bayh referring to coverage of employment discrimination, which he said must refer to Section 901.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.757" offset="12646604">We don't think it must refer to Section 901.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.875" offset="12659038">But then he quoted what he said was the next sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.325" offset="12668860">Well, the fact is that he didn't quote the next sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.779" offset="12682653">The very next sentence talked about the parallelism between Title 6 and Title 9, and similarly, the other statement that he specifically referred to here talks about employment discrimination, and then in the very next sentence, again in the very next sentence talks about the parallelism to Title 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.644" offset="12778052">Now, if you look at the statement that he is referring to, here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.596" offset="12793935">It has got hundreds and hundreds of words in this first part of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.033" offset="12815668">There are only six words that just mention employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.268" offset="12836566">And so the focus clearly of this part is on student discrimination, and the way to reconcile that passing reference to employment discrimination if you construe it to refer to Section 901 is that he intended that it would be covered in the same way that it was covered under Title 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.765" offset="12914620">Now, that is exactly what the Secretary of Education is proposing to do, based on his letter to the Attorney General, and we think this Court should declare the regulations as presently written invalid, because it doesn't contain that nexus requirement that the Secretary is imposing... is proposing, and then allow the Secretary to amend his regulations to conform them to the statute.</text>
