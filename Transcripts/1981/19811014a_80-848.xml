            <label>Mr. James M. Fitzsimons</label>
            <text syncTime="74.648" offset="298527">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.598" offset="302289">Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court, the order which permits us to come before this Court today restricts the appeal to the sole question of whether a federal court action brought by a non-resident foreign plaintiff against an American defendant, whether in that type of action the plaintiff may defeat a motion to dismiss brought on the ground of foreign non-convenience merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied if the case were litigated in that plaintiff's own court would be different or less favorable than it would be if it were tried here in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.343" offset="473339">The factual background of this case is quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.212" offset="488803">In 1976 there was a small six-seat aircraft that crashed into the mountains of Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.885" offset="519523">It was on a charter flight from England to Scotland, and the crash resulted in the deaths of all six people on board; five passengers and the pilot.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.274" offset="565081">All of these people were Scottish citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.894" offset="579500">The aircraft had been owned, operated and maintained for several years prior to the accident by Scottish interests, and the pilot was employed by a Scottish company.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.385" offset="629447">The aircraft was registered with the British authorities, and the pilot was licensed by the Scottish authorities, and the accident was investigated by the British Department of Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.626" offset="682423">The Department's proposed report was the subject of an evidentiary hearing which was conducted by a review board headed by Mr. and later Lord Jauncey, who was assisted, again, by two technical advisors from Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.773" offset="759014">Substantial documentary evidence went before this hearing, and some 13 witnesses testified, most of whom were technicians from Great Britian.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.247" offset="804885">The hearing took place in Edinburgh, Scotland, and as I say, it lasted for nine days.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.085" offset="832261">In addition, Lord Jauncey spent a day in Farnsborough, England, inspecting the wreckage of the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.074" offset="864235">Presently, what remains of the wreckage is still at Farnsborough.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.059" offset="884193">As a result of the accident, a California resident, Gaynell Reyno, has brought this action to recover for the heirs and next of kin of the decedents, that is, the passenger decedents, and her complaint alleges negligence and also strict liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.604" offset="954410">Although she sues as the personal representatives of the estates of these passengers, she is in no way related to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.876" offset="991504">At the time of bringing this action, all of the heirs and survivors of the deceased passengers were Scottish.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.984" offset="1027866">Gaynell Reyno was a resident of the state of California, and a secretary in the office of the attorney for the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.605" offset="1062348">The only connection which the United States has with this accident at all was the fact that some seven years or so prior to the time that the accident occurred, the aircraft had been manufactured in the United States by Piper Aircraft Company, and at the time of its manufacture, it was equipped with a propeller that was manufactured by Hartzell in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.805" offset="1159210">Almost immediately after its manufacture, the aircraft was sold to an interest in Ohio, and by some chain of events not known to defendants, found its way over to Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.881" offset="1219500">On the motion of the defendants, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania granted an order dismissing this action on the ground of foreign non-convenience, and it conditioned that dismissal, as courts generally do, on the defendants waiving any statute of limitations defense they might have and agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.014" offset="1320020">It might be well to point out here at this particular time that these same plaintiffs have brought actions in Scotland against the operating company, against the owner of the aircraft, two Scottish interests, against the pilot, pilot's estate, a Scottish interest, and indeed, against the British Civil Aviation Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.497" offset="1421897">And the pilot's estate himself has also started an action over in Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.151" offset="1444571">In the memorandum opinion which accompanied the order, the district court considered the factors set forth by this court in the seminal foreign non-convenience case of Gulf Oil against Gilbert and its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.911" offset="1507579">And it concluded that the defendants had shown overwhelming reasons for a foreign non-convenience dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.434" offset="1537672">And that court also said that it would be no less than an abuse of discretion on its part if it did not dismiss on the ground of foreign non-convenience, as the Gilbert criteria, quote, "overwhelmingly point to dismissal".</text>
            <text syncTime="401.628" offset="1606426">The district court weighed all the private interest factors set forth in Gilbert, and found that they all clearly pointed to trial in Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.834" offset="1647282">The district court also weighed the public interest factors laid down in Gilbert, and similarly concluded that all of these, too, favored the trial in Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.209" offset="1688764">And in considering these public interests, the district court said that uppermost in its mind was the fact that a trial could be complex and confusing to a jury because it would have to apply the rule of law of Scotland to Hartzell and the rules of liability law of Pennsylvania to Piper.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.453" offset="1965767">Yes, Your Honor, and I believe that that was required because the court over in California had no jurisdiction to pass upon the situation with respect to Hartzell where jurisdiction did not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.361" offset="2017384">And the district court found that this did not constitute any reason why it should not be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.385" offset="2057509">In any event, the circuit court also found that the product liability law of Scotland would not apply to Hartzell, but that indeed, the law of Pennsylvania would apply to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.243" offset="2112888">And what the court said was this: the court held that if the case were transferred over to Scotland, that the Scottish law would apply, and the plaintiffs would lose their cause of action for strict liability and that this was impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.371" offset="2185404">The Third Circuit cited DeMateos against Texaco, Inc. as authority, and it held that a dismissal for foreign non-convenience, like a statutory transfer under 1404(a), should not, despite its convenience, result in a change in the applicable law.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.183" offset="3940728">It is difficult to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.700" offset="3946789">But if one reads what it said and reads as it decided, it is comparatively clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.490" offset="3985868">It went first to the so-called private factors discussed by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.677" offset="4018678">As to three of them, it found the district court in error in relying upon them for grounds for transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.785" offset="4059115">It did not say that they were grounds for retaining the case in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.123" offset="4084402">They had a weight of zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.725" offset="4090880">One of them, the inability of the defendants to implead those in Scotland, whom we believe were responsible for the accident, the court said the district court erred in assigning it great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.536" offset="4166113">It was entitled to weight, the court said, but not so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.506" offset="4185966">We're left then, on the private factors, with all being given the weight of zero and one being given a lesser weight but still weight toward dismissal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.370" offset="4277394">It got, if I may say so, bewitched by the intricacies of the choice of law problem, and ended up with the belief that the Pennsylvania law could be applied by the Pennsylvania court--</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.698" offset="11938691">As a matter of fact, the law of the United States so far has, where there is a U.S. connection and a reason particularly to apply American law, the courts of the United States have been open to the victims of aviation accidents around the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.141" offset="12000549">And in a design case, it's particularly important that they be open because design involves not just one defective article, but involves perhaps a fleet of articles; articles operating in this country and elsewhere in which the United States has a significant interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.753" offset="12070975">We have, then, the manufacturers trying to use a procedural rule to bring about a substantive result, a procedural rule which would under given circumstances deny causes of action and deny in some circumstances the right of recovery against U. S. manufacturers for defectively made products here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.903" offset="12175569">That, in my opinion, is a policy which should not be encouraged and should not be sanctioned by the highest Court of this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.909" offset="12211618">The dismissal process should not be used as a protective shield to determine the outcome of litigation, but to the contrary, it should be used only when there is no real nexus to the United States of America and no conceivable basis upon which the manufacturer could play a role in... the U. S. base manufacturer could play a role in the manufacturing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.826" offset="12315272">I think our position is that based on the limited issue to which certiorari has been granted, that no matter how this Court decides that issue, it should not be determinative or result in a reversal of the Third Circuit Court opinion, because of the very detailed and elaborate weighing of all of the Gulf Oil versus Gilbert factors, and as urged in our brief, because the decision clearly, from the depth of that decision and the detail in the decision in examining those factors, the decision turns not on foreign law or whether it does or does not apply, although it was a significant factor by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.263" offset="12545045">It is clear that all of the other Gulf Oil versus Gilbert factors also were found by the Appellate Court to cause this court, the Appellate Court to believe that there was an abuse of discretion by the trial judge and a failure to meet the burden of proof which the forum non-convenience cases impose upon a moving party, and there was no evidence presented which shows that suing a manufacturer in his own back yard, where the alleged wrongful conduct was conducted, is somehow vexing or harassing a--</text>

            <text offset="0">Mr. Gardner, we have a pretty narrow question here, and we hope for some enlightenment on that narrow question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.472" offset="13729855">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text offset="0">I have two minutes and 56 seconds in which I hope to make six categorical propositions which I hope further will add some enlightenment to this narrow question.</text>
            <text offset="0">One, I was not able to answer the question of Justice Stevens as to product liability cases.</text>
            <text offset="0">At Page 9 of our reply brief, we list seven or eight product liability cases dismissed for forum non-convenience.</text>
            <text offset="0">Two others cited in our briefs... I will not give the citations here... are the Michell and the Harrison cases.</text>
            <text offset="0">The case of Canada Malting was mentioned here.</text>
            <text offset="0">We are of the view there is no way the court below can be affirmed without overruling Canada Malting, which very clearly dismissed a case despite seriously adverse changes in the law.</text>
            <text offset="0">I don't wish to resume my quarrel with the court below, but in 38 pages they never mentioned Canada Malting.</text>
            <text offset="0">Mr. Cathcart explained correctly that the suit in Scotland does not... was not brought against the manufacturers.</text>
            <text offset="0">His statement should he supplemented by the fact that in the United Kingdom there is a suit brought by the Pyrex estate against the American manufacturers over whom jurisdiction has been asserted.</text>
            <text offset="0">The estoppel point, which has figured here and there because of statements made in the District Court of California, decided adversely to the Respondent by two courts below.</text>
            <text offset="0">There was no petition for certiorari based upon that nor any statement in the brief in opposition relying upon it.</text>
            <text offset="0">We think it is a little late to bring it up at this point.</text>
            <text offset="0">What to me was a critical sentence in the opinion of the Court below lay just one sentence beyond the extracts which Justice White read from Page 131.</text>
            <text offset="0">The last sentence of the paragraph on that page is,</text>
            <text offset="0">"The District Court's wide discretion may not serve the defendants as a burden-shifting device on appeal from an order in their favor."</text>
            <text offset="0">In short, discretion of the District Court is given great weight if it be exercised in favor of the plaintiff, not otherwise.</text>
            <text offset="0">The last and brief sentence is that the statements that the court below considered all factors under Gilbert is flatly wrong.</text>
            <text offset="0">If you read the public factors enumerated by the District Court, you will find them ignored by the Court of Appeals, except for the one factor which is categorically described on Page 139.</text>
