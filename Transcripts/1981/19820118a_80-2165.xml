            <text syncTime="8.437" offset="176828">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in June of 1977, an individual raped a young lady at a resort in central Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.328" offset="224475">One day later, that individual was arrested and bond was set at $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.148" offset="251747">In September of that year, that individual pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.152" offset="275780">Bond was continued pending sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.004" offset="287169">Three days later, that same individual, while free on bond, raped again, and this time killed his victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.960" offset="323009">In January of that very next year, in 1978, the Nebraska Legislature proposed an amendment to Article I, Section 9 of the Nebraska Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.618" offset="373582">Prior to the time of the proposal of that amendment, Article I, Section 9, had withheld from persons charged with murder and treason the right to demand bail pending trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.427" offset="424886">The amendment proposed the addition of the crime of forcible rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.812" offset="442336">At the general election in November of 1978, the people of the state of Nebraska, by a vote of 356,000 in favor to 80,000 opposed, adopted this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.303" offset="492387">In May of 1980, Mr. Hunt, the appellee herein, was arrested and charged with multiple counts of forcible rape, and the commission of that crime with the use of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.981" offset="555081">In September of 1980, he was convicted of a number of those charges, and sentenced to consecutive terms of confinement of a maximum of 50 years and a minimum of 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.770" offset="598235">In June of 1980, he filed in the Federal District Court of the District of Nebraska a habeas corpus action naming the judge as the... excuse me, the sheriff as the respondent, and at the same time filed in that court a civil rights action naming Judge Murphy, the appellant herein, as the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.816" offset="670438">In October of 1980, the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska unanimously or... excuse me... in both cases, one judge held that that Nebraska constitutional provision was constitutional in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.175" offset="727802">An appeal was taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and in May of 1981, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit found that in the habeas corpus action the matter was moot, and with reference to the civil rights action, reversed the lower court, and held that the Nebraska constitutional provision violated both the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.774" offset="818186">This appeal was thereafter taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.059" offset="827381">In October, this Court noted probable jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.019" offset="6343189">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, Eugene Hunt was held without bail for a period of four months and three days between the time of his arrest and the commencement of his first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.881" offset="6406614">He was held solely because he was charged with the crime of forcible first degree sexual assault, and upon a finding that the proof was evident and the presumption great by two trial judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.254" offset="6448096">We have a survey that is contained in the joint appendix that reflects the disposition of these no bail cases during the first year that the constitutional amendment was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.496" offset="6501073">It reflects that there were 32 defendants held without bail during the first year that we were able to identify, 20 of whose cases had been disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.204" offset="6547989">Two of these defendants were acquitted by juries after having spent a total of 120 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.410" offset="6584769">Only one defendant out of those 20 was convicted of the original non-bailable offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.333" offset="6616429">The remainder had their charges dismissed, or they pled guilty to reduced bailable misdemeanors or felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.455" offset="6653001">We think this reflects the injustice of this law, the unfairness of this law, the over inclusiveness of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.894" offset="6690722">The central issue in this case, we think, is not whether the state of Nebraska has a legitimate governmental interest in preventing the crime of rape, which we concede it does, but whether Eugene Hunt and other defendants charged with rape have a fundamental right or otherwise constitutionally protected interest in pretrial liberty, which we argue that they do, or even whether preventive detention in general is constitutionally permissible, which we believe is an issue that need not be reached in this case, because Nebraska in fact has not provided for any individual determination of dangerousness by a trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.573" offset="6865429">It is simply presumed dangerousness from the nature of the charge, and the weight of the evidence at the time of the initial charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.012" offset="6899179">The central issue is whether the means chosen by the state to promote its legitimate interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.202" offset="6935959">The means, being denial of pretrial bail to all defendants merely charged with rape where the proof is evident and the presumption great, is substantially related to the effectuation of the state's legitimate purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.658" offset="7085798">Nebraska's evidence code, which was enacted a few years ago, provides that bail hearings or summary proceedings to which the rules of evidence are not applicable, the proceeding is contained in about five pages of a transcript which is contained in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.836" offset="7150477">The proceeding that is contained in the joint appendix was an appeal from the initial denial of bail by a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.773" offset="7178271">The typical proceeding is that the defendant appears with his counsel and the prosecutor before a magistrate initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.712" offset="7214006">The charge is read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.631" offset="7221634">The court makes... sometimes the prosecutor will say a few words about the nature of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.366" offset="7240547">The defense attorney may say a few words about the background of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.570" offset="7253399">The court summarily fixes bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.704" offset="7261967">According to the statutory scheme, our bail reform statutes, which were enacted in the early seventies, and are similar to the Federal Bail Reform Act, the defendant, if he is unable to make the fixed bail within 24 hours after it is initially set has a right of review to another judge, a district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.750" offset="7338140">That was done in this case, and that hearing is contained in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.971" offset="7363009">At that time, I attempted... I told the court that the defendant had roots in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.708" offset="7385997">At that time we told the court that he had a minimal criminal history, and according to the statute, the only factor to be considered in fixing bail is the risk of flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.133" offset="7439704">The statute says nothing about dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.418" offset="7448795">It says nothing about any other factors to be considered other than the risk of non-appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.821" offset="7474395">And those were the background factors that I attempted to provide to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.644" offset="7501667">The court ignored those, and said, according to the constitutional amendment that was passed in 1978 and Parker versus Roth, which was the Nebraska Supreme Court case upholding the constitutionality of that provision, bail is denied.</text>
