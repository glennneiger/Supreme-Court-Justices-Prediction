            <text syncTime="27.021" offset="238350">The issue in this case is whether, under standard Atomic Commission management contracts, three private contractors received and disbursed funds of the United States as agents of the federal government and are, therefore, constitutionally immune from New Mexico's gross receipts and compensating use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.728" offset="345139">Each of the contractors is a party to a management contract with the Department of Energy, a form of contract developed by its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.023" offset="838331">That's the primary reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.366" offset="843764">It really started--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. George W. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="183.254" offset="863304">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.082" offset="866543">It would be very difficult, I imagine, for the government to do the job because they'd have to hire all of these people who have expertise in particular areas who might well be working for private companies in different areas using that expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.123" offset="922759">And very early on... I think this is primarily historical.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.512" offset="940313">The Manhattan Engineer District, which is responsible for the development of the atomic bomb in World War II, decided that the quickest and most efficient way of getting the manpower and the knowledge and the know-how for the development of the atomic bomb was to draw on the resources of private industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.110" offset="1042713">And Congress after World War II when it created the Atomic Energy Commission and gave it statutory authority to control the development of atomic energy, it specifically indicated that the Commission should be permitted to, or the Commission could continue this policy of drawing on or relying on private contractors for the carrying out of its functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.364" offset="1159741">And although the Atomic Energy Commission replaced the Manhattan Engineers District in 1947 and then was in turn replaced by the Energy Research and Development Administration in, I guess, 1975, and then ERDA, the Energy Research and Development Administration, was replaced by the Department of Energy in 1977, they have all continued to use these same kinds of management contracts for the purpose of carrying out their responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.882" offset="1309789">The United States filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that sales to the management contractors were sales to its agents, and therefore, to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.518" offset="1352316">And as a result, immune or exempt from New Mexico gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.155" offset="1374886">The United States also sought declaratory judgment that the funds disbursed by these three contractors were not subject to either the New Mexico gross receipts tax or the compensating tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.946" offset="1437998">On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held that the management contractors were, in fact, agents, and that the sales of personal property to them were exempt from both the gross receipts and compensating taxes, and that the disbursements by the contractors were also exempt from such taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.421" offset="1523888">The Tenth Circuit reversed, holding that the management contractors were not agents and consequently subject to such taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.246" offset="1547190">The court of appeals explained its decision by saying our reiterated antipathy to wholesale deprivations of state treasuries without congressional action requires at the least some special arrangement before tax immunity attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.756" offset="1617302">The relevance of the court of appeals' hostility to federal immunity or deprivations of state treasuries would be dubious in almost any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.736" offset="1661188">And I will attempt to show, that the court's stated antipathy is misdirected is misdirected in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="390.717" offset="1693162">Well, Mr. Jones, are you going to elaborate on your footnote on page 27 of your brief of the Carson-Roane and then repeal of 9(b) and then Kern-Limerick?</text>
            <text syncTime="403.493" offset="1744257">Because certainly, Congress itself was not entirely happy with the Carson-Roane decision, I take it.</text>

          <turn speaker="george_w_jones" startTime="414.536" stopTime="464.750">
            <label>Mr. George W. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="414.536" offset="1788352">But, Justice Rehnquist, there's a substantial difference between saying that the... everyone or all of the contractors with the Atomic Energy Commission are completely immune from state taxation and saying that the contractor shall be immune to the extent that all other contracts with the federal government would be immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.961" offset="1906112">And Congress clearly recognized the distinction because they made it clear that all they were doing was repealing the decision that this Court had interpreted as creating a statutory immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.831" offset="1957626">And I'm not sure what further elaboration on that point you were seeking.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="464.750" offset="1989286">In other words, the government concedes that these contractors are on the same footing as any other sort of government contractors; they don't occupy any special status by virtue of the earlier legislation that was passed in the forties.</text>

          <turn speaker="george_w_jones" startTime="483.883" stopTime="515.401">
            <label>Mr. George W. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="483.883" offset="2065772">We concede only that there's no statutory immunity, such as Section 9(b), but it is not our position that these contractors are like any other contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.188" offset="2127004">I mean, their immunity from taxation is determined in the same way that any other private contractor's immunity would be determined, but the nature of their relationship with the Atomic Energy Commission we think is very different from that of many other private contractors.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.250" offset="2295232">In our view, there is no distinction, no reasonable distinction, to be drawn between the disbursements by these contractors of funds for the payment of services and their disbursement of funds for the payment of goods, because in both cases, the contractors are acting on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.021" offset="2394288">They have no interest in the money they use to purchase these things.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.043" offset="2498465">It had no existence until 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.056" offset="2514452">As I mentioned earlier, it receives no fee from the government, it does no other work.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.163" offset="2538902">Furthermore, in the contract between the United States and Sandia, and Sandia's parent company, Western Electric Company, it indicates that if the contract is terminated, Western Electric, which owns all of the stock of Sandia, would be required to dispose of that stock as directed by the Department of Energy, and before doing that, required to designate a new board of directors, as indicated by the Department of Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.038" offset="2698458">The employees at Sandia were hired solely to perform functions for the government in exactly the same sense as Sandia's purchase of supplies from a third party vendor are made solely for... on behalf of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.297" offset="2779438">Sandia is the largest of the three contractors and it was created in 1949 as a special subsidiary of Western Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.197" offset="2819039">From 1949 until the present time, Sandia has carried on its responsibilities for the government, notwithstanding the changes in the various government agencies that had responsibility for the development of atomic energy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.447" offset="4844052">In addition, New Mexico has what's called a compensating tax imposed on the use of property that is imported into the state without the payment of a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.410" offset="4903924">Although use is one of the aspects of... one of the factors that triggers application of the tax, it is not a use tax of the sort considered by this Court in Boyd, which was a tax on the use per se of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.979" offset="4994204">The use tax involved in this case is essentially a complement to the gross receipts tax to protect New Mexico businessmen from the unfair competition that would result from businessmen, their competitors, being able to buy property outside the state and bring it into the state without paying a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.078" offset="5090543">Since 1819, it has been unquestionably clear that the federal government and its instrumentalities are constitutionally immune from any form of state taxation, absent congressional consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.338" offset="5143624">In our system, the tax immunity of the federal government is the unavoidable consequence of the supremacy declared by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.224" offset="5195137">Kern-Limerick establishes the principle that the federal government's immunity from taxation is preserved even though the federal government chooses to exercise or to perform its work through private contractors or private agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.703" offset="5257100">Kern-Limerick rests very soundly on the truism that the government can only function through employees or agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.791" offset="5301404">And if the individuals or entities through whom the government works can be taxed with respect to their activities on behalf of the government, federal immunity would be largely illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.537" offset="5360440">Accepting this analysis, the court of appeals nonetheless found that the management contractors in this case are not agents for the purposes of procuring goods and services for the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.979" offset="6694148">But it does depend on the nature of the interest that the state purports to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.258" offset="6715255">For example, this Court last term affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit in a case, United States v.

            <text syncTime="1672.544" offset="6820476">And the Tenth Circuit held in that case that there was no meaningful use that the state could tax to the contractor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel H. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="1697.580" offset="6920577">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.933" offset="6989959">I'd like to begin by responding to Justice Stevens' question because I think that question hit the nail on the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.571" offset="7016499">The only thing that is different, if anything is different, about these contractors compared to the contractors in the Kern-Limerick case or King &amp; Boozer is that they get their money up front instead of after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.408" offset="7075849">When you read particularly the reply brief of the United States, it is clear that that is all that they are saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.328" offset="7107614">Now, the benchmark I believe that would assist in analyzing the contractors today is the Boyd case, the case that this Court considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.494" offset="7156202">It is true that there a use tax was being considered rather than a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.101" offset="7182638">But principles were enunciated in that case which indicate that this Court has already scrutinized standard management contractors and said that the mere fact that they contract with the United States, the fact that they operate in a government facility, use advance funds, have a complete absence of risk as a result of advanced funding, undertake important federal duties, have the title to their purchases passed to the United States, that all of this is simply symptomatic of government contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.586" offset="7328610">It does not create agents, it does not create instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.241" offset="7347209">An important concession found at page 201 of the Appendix is the concession by the United States, which I think is proper following the Boyd decision, that these contractors are not instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.938" offset="7406037">Now, I'm never sure what an instrumentality is, but in some way I read that to mean that the mere fact of a contractual association is not enough to make you an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.918" offset="7453893">Advanced funding was used from the beginning of the Atomic Energy Commission, it was used at the time this Court decided Roane-Anderson, it is continued to be used after Congress legislatively reversed the Roane-Anderson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.270" offset="7523379">The United States is simply selecting one contractual element of the relationship and after the fact reading in great significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.783" offset="7561413">There is really no difference, as shown by the history of advance funding within the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.342" offset="7587640">We have cited in our brief and in the transcript the fact that the Atomic Energy Commission has always viewed these contractors as cost plus contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.760" offset="7625257">This Court in Boyd called them cost plus contractors, even though they were getting advanced funding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.768" offset="7705296">I believe Justice Brennan pointed out licenses, payments effectively of overhead to Western Electric, totaling some $300,000 in the year in which the interrogatory was responded to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.509" offset="7788261">They might, indeed, Justice Burger, and basically, it's important to remember, I believe, that Sandia, although it was created to undertake these contracts, was created, if you'll pardon the colloquial expression, by the telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.754" offset="7837266">Sometimes I feel as if the telephone company is the government of the United States, but that is only in jest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.924" offset="7861926">Route 128 around Boston, Silicone Valley in San Francisco, is surrounded by companies that are created to work for the government, that only exist to work for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.825" offset="7905603">The real comparison, I believe, is with the corporations that the United States did set up in World War II to build ships, to build munitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.148" offset="7950847">There were reasons why the United States has chosen to go the private route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.334" offset="7971640">And as Justice Brennan asked about GOGCO plants, government owned, contractor operated, I believe the Michigan property cases are decisions by this Court recognizing that even though you are working in a government facility, using government property, you're still subject to taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.406" offset="8035901">I think what the United States confuses in looking at advance funding is the difference between absence of risk, which I say is endemic to government contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.073" offset="8086579">If you're on cost plus, whether you get paid in advance or get paid after, unless you're taking vacations in Tahiti with the money, there is no risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.397" offset="8127852">What the government is confusing is the absence of risk compared to who has the obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.755" offset="8605266">Apparently not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.396" offset="8607879">And an example that I would give you is in the Boyd case, after the decision in Boyd by this Court that the Boyd contractor was subject to property taxes, it was paid from advance funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.205" offset="8651033">And I've cited in my brief from the pleadings in that case indicating that it was the contractor who paid the tax, but he paid it with advance funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.700" offset="8689067">The important point I believe from that illustration is that it was the contractor's obligation to pay the tax; he was the one that was liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.354" offset="8727624">And turning to a question that was asked, similarly with the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.181" offset="8746955">And remember there are 7000 employees of these contractors, only 160 of whom are involved in procurement, meaning transactions with third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.911" offset="8789900">Fifty-eight percent of all these contractors' receipts are not in that classic agent relationship of dealing with third parties; 58 % are simply to meet the payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.796" offset="8837443">And we are in a situation in which the United States has conceded they are not instrumentalities; we are not liable for their torts, we don't want to be involved in their labor relations; we conceived that the contractors are independent contractors in hiring and supervising these employees, and yet when the taxman comes calling, suddenly as the reply brief says, they are simply independent contractors working for a fee for the Zia Company or for Sandia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.659" offset="8964920">This to me strains the concept of employee greatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.625" offset="8980803">The United States has made so many concessions in this case about its relationship vis a vis the contractors' employees that there is no way of finding that the contractors' 7000 employees in some way have a direct contractual relationship with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.650" offset="9052901">True, advanced funding is used to meet the payroll, but the question is, is it the United States' obligation to pay those employees or is it the contractor's?</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.848" offset="9101697">I think the distinction has to be that under these contracts, as under any cost plus contract, it is the United States that has an obligation to Sandia, Zia and LACI to pay them.</text>
