            <label>Mr. John J. McAleese, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="96.431" offset="539093">That's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.227" offset="542228">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="109.612" offset="591860">In this case the courts below stretched the reach of the contract portion of Section 1981 of Title 42 to impose liability for racial discrimination on a private business organization and three private trade associations who themselves did not practice discrimination, did not have any intent to discriminate, did not conspire to discriminate, and neither knew nor had reason to know that the discrimination for which they were held liable was being practiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.079" offset="757685">Thus, the general question presented hereby is whether Section 1981 does indeed reach so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.200" offset="794152">The case began in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 1971 when 12 blacks in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sued, among others, a construction union, a construction contractor, and three contractor associations for racial discrimination under, among other statutes, Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.864" offset="880774">The focus of the complaint was the union's exclusive referral system which was found by the trial court and not challenged, was facially neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.328" offset="930721">The action was certified as a class action on both the Plaintiff and the Defendant's sides, the construction contractor, Glasgow, being the class representative for approximately 1500 other contractors, and the associations being the class representatives for other associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.239" offset="1022358">This afternoon I will argue on behalf of Glasgow, and Mr. Kester on behalf of the associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.660" offset="1052033">The case was bifurcated for trial into a liability phase and a damage phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.126" offset="1073872">The former has been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.078" offset="1081708">The latter essentially has not started.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.701" offset="1092157">Following trial, the trial court imposed liability under Section 1981 on the union, on Glasgow, and on the three associations, and thus on the members of the defendant classes that these defendants represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.836" offset="1164673">It issued an extensive injunction against all defendants and class members, which included hiring quotas and training programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.596" offset="1207723">Stated in a somewhat simplified fashion, the trial court's decision under Section 1981 respecting Glasgow was that the union, defendant union intentionally discriminated against minorities in the operation of its referral system, and solely because Glasgow, acting pursuant to a lawful contractual duty, notified the union of its need for workmen, and thereafter hired persons referred by the union, it, too, was enveloped within the Section 1981 net.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.643" offset="1371981">I might again add that the trial court found... and those findings are unchallenged... that Glasgow itself did not discriminate, did not intend to discriminate, did not conspire to discriminate, and neither knew nor had reason to know that the union was practicing discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.650" offset="1447945">The Third Circuit en banc divided equally, thereby affirming, and did not seek... and did not issue any opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.836" offset="1480755">The union did not seek review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.771" offset="1496428">Some background facts are helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.349" offset="1506773">In 1961 Glasgow, a Philadelphia unionized excavating contractor, had a collective bargaining agreement with the Operating Engineers Local Union which represented operating engineers employed by Glasgow.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.452" offset="1563197">Operating engineers run heavy construction equipment, cranes, bulldozers and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.668" offset="1588066">Up until then, Glasgow was free to obtain operating engineers from any available source.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.446" offset="1615129">He could hire off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.914" offset="1629026">Glasgow's labor agreement with the engineers was scheduled to expire around mid-1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.755" offset="1656402">In the negotiations that year for a new labor agreement Glasgow was represented by one of the contractor associations which is a petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.796" offset="1696526">Glasgow was participating in these negotiations pursuant to its legal duty under federal law to bargain in good faith with the Engineers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.605" offset="1743756">Glasgow was faced in these negotiations with a demand by the union for an agreement to obtain operating engineers for employment from no other source except the union's referral system.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.582" offset="1799658">As presented by the union in the negotiations and as found by the courts below and unchallenged here, the union's referral system was racially neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.171" offset="1850022">Glasgow and the other employers who were involved in that particular negotiation wanted no part of this provision, and accordingly gave an outright rejection to this union demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.089" offset="1905715">An impasse in bargaining ensued, and because the demand was and is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining under federal law, the union, with impunity, struck Glasgow and the other employers to force their agreement to the union's referral system.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.860" offset="1980843">After a ten week strike which the trial court called destructive, Glasgow and the others capitulated to the union and thereupon agreed to notify the union of the need for workmen so that referrals could be made by the union to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.979" offset="2057330">In 1963 an attempt was made by Glasgow and other contractors to rid themselves of the referral provision but a strike, another strike, lengthy strike rendered this unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.221" offset="2122218">The duty to notify the union of a need for workmen and to consider referrals for employment has been a part of all labor agreements between Glasgow and the Engineers Union since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.966" offset="2181254">The union's referral system places engineers in groups upon length of service and aligns and refers them on a first in-first out basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.259" offset="2218453">Throughout the entire period covered by this case, the registration, the grouping within this referral system, the aligning within the groups, and indeed, the referrals were performed solely and exclusively by employees of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.563" offset="2307583">As contractually and indeed legally obligated to do, Glasgow used the system by notifying the union of its need and then hiring referrals therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.041" offset="2361499">The District Court specifically determined that the employees of the union who, without the knowledge or any reason to know by Glasgow that these employees who registered, grouped, aligned and referred engineers, failed to do so in accordance with the rules governing the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.174" offset="2442061">In the words of the trial court, the union procedures in general constituted a motley fabric of arbitrary departure from the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.934" offset="2489081">Instead, and in breach of the collective bargaining agreement with Glasgow, those employees of the union registered, grouped, aligned and/or referred engineers in an intentionally racially discriminatory fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.206" offset="2578211">The collective bargaining agreement, Justice Rehnquist, contains an outline of how the system is constructed, the union's referral system, and specifies, as it were, the rules for the running of that system, and when the union, instead of complying with those rules, but instead engaging in this conduct, as it were, outside the agreement, engaged in a breach of the agreement.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="659.140" offset="2789908">Counsel, I suppose respondents rely in part on a theory that 1981 imposes a non-delegable duty on the employers, and secondly, that the employers had an obligation to enforce the terms of the collective bargaining agreement as to hiring in a nondiscriminatory fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.958" offset="2889173">Would you address those theories?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_mcaleese_jr" startTime="686.442" stopTime="772.985">
            <label>Mr. John J. McAleese, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="686.442" offset="2899099">Yes, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.645" offset="2899935">With respect to the second question that you asked, treating that first, they do intend... indeed contend that we had an obligation to enforce, but keep in mind that there are unchallenged findings that Glasgow, and indeed, other contractors, neither knew nor had reason to know that the union was practicing discrimination, was, as Justice Rehnquist said, its conduct was contrary to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.490" offset="3027308">Now, with respect to your first question, there is a contention indeed that 1981 imposes a non-delegable duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.440" offset="3067119">I think that question can be approached analytically in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.001" offset="3093346">I think first, going directly to the issue, does it contain a non-delegable duty, I think that in turn depends upon the construction of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.214" offset="3138277">The non-delegable duty spoken of by the trial court in its lengthy opinion was a duty stemming from 1981 imposed on Glasgow under these circumstances to prevent the discrimination being practiced by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.191" offset="3222182">In a sense, it was a strict liability standard that was imposed on Glasgow--</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Kester</label>
            <text syncTime="1505.408" offset="6174959">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.078" offset="6185721">I'm coming before you this afternoon to speak on behalf of the forgotten persons in this case, the three trade associations who were held liable, along with the employers, along with the Apprenticeship Committee and along with the union for discrimination which was practiced by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.025" offset="6253431">This case comes before the Court with a very sharp and very clear legal issue, and that issue is not whether the victims of racial discrimination may recover under 1981 against the discriminator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.082" offset="6305676">The issue before the Court is how far that liability under Section 1981 is to be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.908" offset="6333052">The issue is, in that respect, not whether 1981 reaches private action, but whether it also extends to reach private inaction, and the issue is very sharp because the case comes up with the benefit of some unusually candid, clear and conscientious findings by the district judge who tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.538" offset="6423540">The district judge found, as Mr. McAleese said, that the associations did not discriminate, they didn't know the discrimination was going on, and they didn't even have reason to know that the discrimination was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.300" offset="6470561">And I think, Mr. Justice Marshall, that is at least a partial answer to the question you raised to Mr. McAleese before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.906" offset="6496997">We have in this case a clear, specific finding that they didn't have knowledge or notice, and I think that this Court, unlike the NAACP case that was before you a little while ago, where there is some contention among the parties as to what is a finding of fact and what is a conclusion, we don't have any of that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.274" offset="6566482">It's clear findings of fact what we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.929" offset="6577036">There was no appeal from those findings of fact, and we all take it on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.694" offset="6592187">Now, what this court has to wrestle with are the legal conclusions of the district court, and the district court was equally candid about what his legal conclusions were, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.798" offset="6636595">He was persuaded on the authority mainly of a case called Davis against Los Angeles, which the Court will remember, which this Court subsequently vacated, he was persuaded that 1981 liability should be greatly extended beyond the discriminators, beyond the people who dealt with the discriminators to my client, the General Building Contractors Association of Philadelphia, which did nothing more than negotiate the collective bargaining agreement which the union later violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.942" offset="6761147">Now, to reach that conclusion... and unfortunately the legal reasoning in this case is a little bit murkier than the findings of fact... to reach that conclusion he first concluded that 1981 does not require any proof of intent to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.108" offset="6825826">He said that even though they had no knowledge and notice of the discrimination, the associations were liable even though they weren't employers, because not one operating engineer has ever been employed by one of my clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.320" offset="6882668">My clients wouldn't know what to do if an operating engineer came in the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.631" offset="6895939">They are an office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.335" offset="6898760">They are people sitting at desks, and all they do is administer administrative matters for the members of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.939" offset="6941078">I'd like to just touch briefly, before we go any further, on this question of non-delegable duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.451" offset="6979217">I think, Mr. Justice White, that, and Mr. Justice Brennan, that you two have framed essentially two alternative ways of deciding the case, but I don't think you can have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.337" offset="7030730">I think non-delegable duty is a word that, in essence it begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.741" offset="7052360">There is a lot of jargon floating around in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.864" offset="7060823">Non-delegable duty is one of the bits of jargon that's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.207" offset="7078169">But a duty not to discriminate does not exist in a void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.314" offset="7098649">Duties are something that somebody owes to somebody else, and the question before the Court is, with respect to my client, what kind of duty did my client owe to the people who were discriminated against by the union, like Local 542.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.034" offset="8489512">Now, I started to say with respect to the hiring hall... and that is the only basis on which discrimination was charged against my client... Judge Higginbotham in the district court referred on the very first page of his opinion to discrimination in what he called Local 542's exclusive hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.697" offset="8576134">On page 2 he says Local 542's function as an exclusive hiring hall, and he goes on throughout the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.757" offset="8604347">The notion that the hiring hall is anything other than the union itself is something that's just crept into this case at a very, very late stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.973" offset="8637261">The hiring hall is the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.956" offset="8645202">If you read the collective bargaining agreements, if you look at the Joint Appendix at page 231, 141, 255, the words hiring hall never appear in the collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.076" offset="8689715">The collective bargaining agreements say the union shall provide the work force, and that's exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.995" offset="8713330">On the question of control which came up a little while ago, I'd like to say a couple things on that, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.023" offset="8749483">In the first place, this Court has several decisions under Section 1983... and this of course is Section 1981... under 1983 which have said that even the right to control is not a sufficient basis for liability, in the Monell case and the Rizzo case, for examples, and what the district court said in its opinion really, was not, Justice O'Connor, that there was a right to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.950" offset="8861183">The pertinent language is at page 163 of the appendix to No. 280, in footnote 61, and at that point what the district court did was it equated the right to oppose with the right to control, and I think those are two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.241" offset="8930355">He said if something was... it's like saying if you now somebody's doing something wrong and you may have a cause of action to sue them, therefore you control them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.847" offset="8964732">Well, there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip in lawsuits and any other kind of quasi-lawsuit activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.687" offset="8996079">So there really was no finding of control here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.763" offset="9008409">But I would say even if there were a finding of a right to control, that still wouldn't be a sufficient basis for liability under 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.590" offset="9035681">I cannot believe that this Court would say that the obligations of distantly related private individuals under Section 1981 are greater than the obligations of government officials under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.132" offset="9093881">Now, we may want to think about what is the effect of this decision, whether it goes one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.610" offset="9147798">This Court has had a number of cases before it, going back to Jones against Myers Company in 1968 involving the post-Civil Rights... or the post-Civil War legislation, and I would say first of all the country's basic antidiscrimination law is not Section 1981; it's Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.960" offset="9237241">And Title 7 has a very carefully thought out set of remedies, set of procedures, and set of protections for persons who might be held liable under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.206" offset="9278201">Jones against Myers Company was decided four years after Title 7 was on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.345" offset="9298786">Now, 1981, which dates back to 1866 and 1870, is a law guaranteeing equal rights generally, an equal right to testify, to enter contracts, equal punishments, taxes, and licenses, and if there is in its legislative history, which goes on for hundreds of pages, there's not one hint of a kind of vicarious liability such as proposed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.349" offset="9402753">If this case involves an exception, if you would regard this as some kind of a loophole in civil rights liability, I'd have to say any requirement of intent, then, would be a loophole, and yet this Court habitually requires intent in all of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.655" offset="9479971">And this Court in Monell and other cases has consistently rejected thoughts of vicarious liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.730" offset="9508288">The respondents in this case are proposing a rather extravagant position that anyone who is in any way involved with a discriminator or, in the case of my client, anyone who even contracts with a discriminator becomes liable regardless of knowledge for any kind of discrimination that occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.081" offset="9593656">I don't know what kind of principle limit there would be to that kind of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.705" offset="9608180">It's as if you hire somebody to paint your house and it turns out that the house painter was discriminating, and you're held liable for his discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.076" offset="9645692">That's not what was intended by 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.292" offset="9654574">I dont think that the draftsmen in 1981 thought about this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.791" offset="9668575">I don't think any of this is what they had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.463" offset="9679233">And several members of the Court have already expressed reservations about drifting steadily into more and more extravagant interpretations of the post-Civil War legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.801" offset="9724582">I think perhaps the most pertinent citation for this case really is not any of the 1981 cases or the common law cases or the scholars that we cite or the extensive legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.167" offset="9810054">I think perhaps the most pertinent citation for this case is what this Court said at the conclusion of the little snail darter case, Tennessee Valley against Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.071" offset="9849656">In that case the Court quoted from Sir Thomas More as he is thought to have said and expressed in the play "A Man for All Seasons", and one of Sir Thomas More's friends expresses impatience with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.830" offset="9916739">The law doesn't do everything he wants it to do, and as quoted by this Court, Sir Thomas More said, what would you do, cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.920" offset="9953101">And when the last law was down and the Devil turned around on you, where would you hide, Gofrey, the laws all being flat?</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.807" offset="9980582">This is a case where impatience could lead to some very bad results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.383" offset="9998868">There's certainly nothing attractive for victimized minorities in this country if limits on liability are ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.818" offset="10028647">There would be nothing hopeful for the NAACP, which was the petitioner in the previous case, in a legal system where vicarious absolute liability could be imposed without regard to knowledge or intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.235" offset="10082355">That's not consistent with the law of a century ago, and it's not consistent with the prevailing sense of justice today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.435" offset="10111090">At page 420 of the Joint Appendix, the respondents said in the Court of Appeals, and I quote their position,</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.914" offset="10157065">"The notion of agency and control are smokescreens. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.241" offset="10166365">"Our theory of the case in the beginning, and it is the one found by Judge Higginbotham, is one of strict liability. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.192" offset="10194159">I would say to the Court, I don't think you can find strict liability in Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.799" offset="10220595">I think it requires intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.767" offset="10224461">I think it requires causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.871" offset="11496833">Now, in that particular instance it is clear that 1500 employers relied on Local 542, not on their foremen, not on employment agencies, and the result of that were that hundreds of minorities, solely because of their race, were denied jobs with the employers and were precluded from earning a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.128" offset="11589829">It is clear that 1036 employers out of 1500 never employed a minority operating engineer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.030" offset="11625460">Because they chose to rely on Local 542.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.216" offset="11642283">It is equally clear that the financial cost to minorities approximately 1 million hours a year in lost work, multiplied by the wages over a 15 year limitation period, that would be in excess of $100 million solely because of a persons race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.584" offset="11727756">Now, the hiring hall as such is not the only entity in this matter, and it is not the only area in which our opponents agree that there was racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.265" offset="11766417">They set up, as Justice Blackmun pointed out, an apprenticeship program which is called the Joint Apprenticeship Program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.369" offset="11834858">It says the entrustees for the employers shall represent the employers and their interests, and the same for the union trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.803" offset="11864533">The Joint Apprenticeship Program engaged in intentional discrimination, denying entry and jobs to minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.973" offset="11893268">And again, that is undisputed, it is intentional, and it is unchallenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.486" offset="11915315">But more than any other fact in this case, there is one other joint one that has not been mentioned, and that is the history of the Philadelphia Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.404" offset="11946975">Judge Higginbotham devoted a considerable amount of his findings to that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.791" offset="11980517">I don't think Judge Higginbotham forgot about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.431" offset="11991070">He described his clients, Mr. Kester's, and he said it in these words: The conduct of the associations, particularly with respect to the affirmative action program which substituted for the Philadelphia Plan, demonstrated a reckless disregard for equal employment opportunity for minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.301" offset="12058570">The Federal Government, after years of experience, and I must say as the Court took judicial notice in Weber of the historical discrimination against minorities in the construction industry, the Federal Government decided on a common sense approach, namely, the employers pay the wages, the employers put people to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.573" offset="12131713">And so as a result they put the operating engineers as a craft, not the union, the craft, the employers, under the coverage of the Philadelphia Plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.206" offset="12362218">So at stage one he dealt just with liability and with issues related to injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.853" offset="12456781">He then concluded that 1981 does in fact have a vicarious liability component.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.679" offset="12484053">In doing that he drew on essentially two theories, one, the non-delegable duty, and two, essentially one of agency or joint enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.156" offset="13017996">Section 1981, in our judgment, does create non-delegable duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.886" offset="13052895">It seems to me, as Justice Cardoza said in the Sheffield case, that an employer in the end must be responsible for his own work force, regardless of who he delegates things to, whether or not it is an independent agency, whether or not it's a foreman, it is the employer in the end which has a duty to make sure that its work force isn't plagued with, as was the case here, intentional racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.531" offset="13163445">If, for example, an exemption was found under 1981 because instead of relying on a foreman an employer chose to rely on a union or an employment agency or any independent contractor, it would be a massive loophole in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.008" offset="13229379">Faced with virtually this question in Radio Officers, a case under the National Labor Relations Act in 1954, the Court imputed intentional discrimination under Section 8(b)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act to employers, and that's all that we are saying here, and it is vicarious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.578" offset="13311717">There's no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.109" offset="13317777">But in the end, can any employer function in this day and age except vicariously?</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.748" offset="13340347">After all, if we phrase this in terms of a foreman and posed it in terms of Glasgow, not knowing whether or not its foreman engaged in racial discrimination, I would submit that the Court would conclude that whether Glasgow knew what its foreman was doing would be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.631" offset="13407847">In fact, that was virtually the facts in the Furnco case with Henry Dacies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.926" offset="14357032">But we are saying with respect to the Associations that here they created an industrywide system, a system which compelled their members, and as a matter of fact non-members, to rely on a union which practiced intentional racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.826" offset="14420667">Now, the fact that they're an association and not an employer doesn't advance the argument much further, because in the end of course associations don't employ people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.774" offset="14456507">Employers often for purposes of collective bargaining will create associations to bargain on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.944" offset="14481166">They also created them in this instance to set up the joint apprenticeship program, and the associations appoint trustees, and the apprenticeship program engaged in intentional racial discrimination, all of which is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.205" offset="14534143">Now, in our judgment, faced with those facts, Judge Higginbotham correctly held the associations liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.607" offset="14563818">As a matter of fact, in a subsequent proceeding in assessing the remedial costs of the injunction Judge Bechtel assessed more liability against the associations because of their high degree of culpability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3636.750" offset="14700386">There is no exemption in 1981 for that, and it seems to me that the statute must create a responsibility in the end on an employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="4048.521" offset="16347459">They were necessary because the only way minorities could get a nondiscriminatory share of the work in the next five years is to include them in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.954" offset="16389150">And I say nondiscriminatory because it's a gradual remedy over five years, and it's not until the fourth or fifth year that nondiscrimination as measured by the population of minorities in the labor force will be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.418" offset="16447037">So that's the first reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.902" offset="16452993">The second reason, and the critical reason, is that the District Court was in this instance more than just familiar with the history of the Philadelphia plan and the history of discrimination in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.960" offset="16501163">He knew, as the Federal Government knew, that a Philadelphia type plan remedy was absolutely necessary, or else equal employment opportunity could never be achieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="4124.600" offset="16651733">I think, phrased another way, the question is can the District Court as an exercise of its discretion assess remedial, as opposed to damage or back pay, relief against parties whom it found to be critically necessary to achieving the injunctive relief we achieved here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.326" offset="16722681">And I think the answer is that the District Court did have the discretion to do so and just as in Kuran, for example, in the Eleventh Amendment case, where the state could not be sued in damages because of the bar of the Eleventh Amendment, this Court has held, despite that bar, District Courts have the discretion to award costs against the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="4286.910" offset="17301032">However, if the Court reaches that separate question, just as Zipes last week held that a union which was not culpable, had no claims to anything other than wrongdoer status, was being compelled to reorder its seniority lists in order to make whole as a matter of an injunction the victims of discrimination, Judge Higginbothem in this case I think had that same discretion to exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.803" offset="17424539">And I think he correctly exercised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.709" offset="17432167">As a matter of fact, it has been obscured but ought to be pointed out here that in this particular case the employers themselves suggested the very remedy which Judge Higginbothem imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.829" offset="17480650">They recognized in the end that the duty not to discriminate, the duty to comply with Section 1981, was on them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4394.272" offset="17730485">so in answer to Justice White's question, the Associations not only do have the power to file grievances, but in this instance exercised it to seek an arbitration award that relieved them of any responsibility for Local 542.</text>

            <text syncTime="4411.797" offset="17800598">But Judge Higginbothem found that that order would have denied minorities the equitable relief against the employers that they were entitled to, and for that reason denied it, denied the motion to uphold that arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.431" offset="17859112">But I think as well, Chief Justice Burger, the notion that Local 542 held a pistol to the heads of 1500 companies and associations and compelled it to rely on it and compelled it to engage in collective racial discrimination that was intentional, misstates the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.797" offset="17940510">Again, Your Honor, for the last 18 years there's never been any evidence of any strike or coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.671" offset="17968095">But even if there was a strike and a coercion, suppose a union compelled in some sort of way an employer to rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.513" offset="17995472">The question becomes, if the employer's work force is then found to be the product of intentional racial discrimination, must it be free?</text>

            <text syncTime="4550.366" offset="18354812">They have a right, in our judgment, to work on the same basis as whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.193" offset="18378113">People who've given their lives to this country it seems to me have that right, and it's been guaranteed since 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.282" offset="18406534">And I think ultimately the question here is, what if we sued just Glasgow and did not sue Local 542.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.562" offset="18435583">What if we showed the same set of facts, that Glasgow had zero minorities and all whites, and that that work force was the product of intentional racial discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.729" offset="18488245">Could there be any doubt that for purposes of injunctive relief, simply to get prospective nondiscrimination, that minorities with respect to Glasgow, under those sets of facts, would have a right to work equally?</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.316" offset="18542685">Not quotas, not something special, but nondiscrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.331" offset="18562642">That's all paragraph 12 of this decree provides, nondiscrimination, to prevent the reoccurrence of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.296" offset="18594512">In this particular instance, in our judgment the employers have recognized what we have contended, that the duty is on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.809" offset="18628575">They have recognized, I think, what Justice Cardoza said, and that is the duty under labor laws must be non-delegable, because if they were not non-delegable there would be enormous loopholes in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.599" offset="18683746">In the Sheffield case, which I think is interesting only because it doesn't deal in the race area, there was a New York statute which said that employers could not employ anyone under the age of 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.204" offset="18742156">And the bus company had one of its bus drivers, as a matter of helping him, hire a boy who was 12 years old.</text>

            <text syncTime="4661.651" offset="18799939">Justice Cardoza said, in upholding criminal liability under a New York labor statute, that it is not an example of respondeat superior; it is an example of non-delegable duty, a duty the employer owed in that case not to employ children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.768" offset="18872454">In this case, after Alexander versus Gardner-Denver Company, this Court has said that the ban against employment discrimination and the need to protect the right of minorities in that respect is of the highest priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.309" offset="18934626">It seems to me in the end that the employers in this case must have that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.572" offset="18959703">If it were just left up to Local 542, my clients could not get a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.945" offset="18981124">It would be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.554" offset="18987602">In the end, Judge Higginbothem in our judgment, A, properly imputed intentional discrimination of the union and the apprenticeship program to the employers; secondly, he properly exercised his discretion to give the Plaintiffs a make-whole remedy that would ensure nothing more nor less than nondiscrimination over the next five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.839" offset="19088748">After years of intentional discrimination, proof of which is undisputed in this case... examples of people could be told and told again, but Judge Higginbothem has done that far more eloquently than I can... it is our submission that minorities do have the same right to work as whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.224" offset="19162309">They did not have.</text>
