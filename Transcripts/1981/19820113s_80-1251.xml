            <text syncTime="7.487" offset="107342">The first is 80-1251, United States versus Vogel Fertilizer Corporation. This is a case here on certiorari from the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.124" offset="165856">It's a tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.938" offset="173171">The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 limits a controlled group of corporations to a single surtax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.707" offset="220191">The group of corporations involved in this case consists of two corporations, Vogel Fertilizer Company and Vogel Popcorn Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.996" offset="265435">There are two stockholders in the Fertilizer Company, one, Vogel, who owns 77.5% and one, Crain, who owns the remaining 22.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.480" offset="311306">But Crain is not a stockholder of the Popcorn Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.085" offset="329696">Vogel owns 87.5% of that company stock and the rest is also held by him as trustee of the family trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.742" offset="368358">Now in implementing Treasury Regulation interprets the relevant statutory term to constitute two or more corporations, a controlled group.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.578" offset="407750">If the same five or fewer persons own “singly or in combination” certain prescribed percentages of voting power or total value 80-percent of the total of the one corporation and more than 50-percent of the total of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.652" offset="484028">Since Vogel and Crain between them own more than 80-percent of the stock of the Fertilizer Company and Vogel alone owns over 90-percent of the Popcorn Company, if the provision of the regulation singly or in combination is valid, then the two companies are a controlled group entitled only a single surtax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.003" offset="569396">But we hold that the implementing Treasury Regulation is invalid as not being a reasonable interpretation of the statute it purports to implement.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.595" offset="611819">We read the statute to require that precisely the same shareholders must satisfy both the 80-percent and 50-percent requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.073" offset="653719">And since Crain is not a stockholder of the Popcorn Company but only the Fertilizer Company, the statutory requirement is not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.146" offset="686007">We therefore affirm the Court of Claims would reach the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.992" offset="709412">Mr. Justice Blackmun joined by Justice White, dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
