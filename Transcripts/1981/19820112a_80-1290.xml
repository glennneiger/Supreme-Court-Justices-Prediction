            <label>Mr. James P. Allison</label>
            <text syncTime="38.625" offset="286295">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves Article XVI, Section 65 of the Texas Constitution, the resign to run provision, and Article III, Section 19, concerning eligibility to the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.885" offset="355363">The action was brought for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief alleging violation of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.942" offset="391621">The officeholder plaintiffs were a judge of the county court at law, two justices of the peace, and a constable.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.179" offset="424535">Other plaintiffs included citizens and registered voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.833" offset="439163">The defendants were the local and state officers who were charged with the enforcement of the challenged provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.403" offset="465390">The district court held that both Article XVI, Section 65, and Article III, Section 19, contravened the equal protection clause of the U. S. Constitution, and therefore the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.163" offset="532473">The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court opinion adopted in the memorandum pending in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.852" offset="559222">A short, very brief historical background on these provisions and the Texas political system would be helpful in analyzing these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.724" offset="602690">The current Texas constitution was adopted in 1876.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.445" offset="621603">The constitution provides for a very decentralized system of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.766" offset="646889">Under this constitution, almost all local and state offices are elected, and from 1876 until the 1950s each of these, almost all of these were elected for a two-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.776" offset="698925">In the 1950s, four-year terms were extended to most of these offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.893" offset="719405">In 1954, four-year terms were extended to the precinct and county offices included in Article XVI, Section 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.618" offset="758275">In 1958, after the people of the state had extended four-year terms to these offices, the resign to run provision in Article XVI, Section 65, was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.426" offset="809475">Article III, Section 19 has been included in the Texas constitution since the constitution of the Republic of Texas was drafted in 1836.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.615" offset="850226">I would first like to point out an error in the conclusions reached by the district court in its memorandum opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.970" offset="883663">The district court found and apparently relied heavily upon a distinction between the application of the resign to run rule to the office of justice of the peace and its application to the office of municipal court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.730" offset="950746">The district court stated that the justice of the peace is included under Article XVI, Section 65, and the municipal court judge, who has very similar jurisdiction, is not, and found that to be a distinction of some great importance in finding that the resign to run rule contravened the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.945" offset="1043637">What the district court overlooked was Article XI, Section 11 of the Texas constitution, adopted in 1958, at the same time as the resign to run rule in Article XVI, Section 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.336" offset="1101106">Article XI, Section 11, states that any municipality which extends the terms of its officers from two years to four years, that once that is done, that those officers will be under the same resign to run provisions as offices that are under Article XVI, Section 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.285" offset="1188982">So there is no distinction between the application of the resign to run rules, between the office of justice of the peace and any municipal office, whether it be municipal judge--</text>

            <text syncTime="546.931" offset="2319562">I would further point out that among the activities not restricted to Article XVI, Section 65, is the right to test the water, that persons who contemplate running for office in Texas have the opportunity to go out and solicit possible support without having to resign an office, and that is in direct opposition to the position taken by the plaintiff appellees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.963" offset="2423634">I would further point out that the Texas resign to run rule does not involve any suspect classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.652" offset="2450383">There is no direct burden on any particular portion of the electorate or upon any particular political viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.639" offset="2478386">The only effects upon the voters would be if they wished to support a particular candidate and that candidate was in mid-term of an office he was holding at the time, and he declined to run because of the resign to run rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.566" offset="2538050">In that limited sense you could say that the Article XVI, Section 65, resign to run provision has some slight effect upon the pool of candidates available to the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.207" offset="2584652">Otherwise, it has none.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.740" offset="2590817">Article XVI, Section 65, appears to be a unique resign to run provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.812" offset="2619030">Although a majority of the states now have some resign to run rule, Article XVI, Section 65 differs as nearly as I can determine from all of these, in that Article XVI, Section 65, applies only to the first three years of a four-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.857" offset="2687261">In the last year of your term in Texas, you are free to run for any office, either re-election of the office you then hold or for any other office that you might choose to announce for.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.713" offset="2730625">I believe this is important in weighing the rationale behind the adoption of the resign to run rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.569" offset="2762076">In 1954, when the four-year terms were extended, replacing the two-year terms, the people of Texas staggered the terms to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.841" offset="2803141">That is, they provided that approximately one-half of the officeholders would come up every two years, thereby shortening the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.697" offset="2834592">What this also did was create a temptation and an opportunity for an officeholder in mid-term, in the middle of the four-year term that had been extended to him, to run for another office, to take a free ride while continuing to hold the office that he had been elected to for a four-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.659" offset="2906481">The state interests served by the resign to run rule have been widely discussed in other cases, and were recognized by the district court in its opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.768" offset="2958830">The resign to run rule prevents abuse of office, and in this case, by applying it to the first three years of the term, it also prevents neglect of the duties of the office, and that a person may not go out and use his time to run for office while occupying the office he has been elected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.880" offset="3035317">It also prevents abuse of office by a losing candidate who if he were allowed to run in mid-term would return to the office that he had presently held and continue to serve for two years after having run and lost for another race, and certainly it also eliminates even the appearance of impropriety of candidates who are holding an office being allowed to run for higher office or other office in the middle of their term.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.495" offset="3133746">There is no less restrictive means to achieve these ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.982" offset="3151719">The other possibilities, a leave of absence provision, for example, would certainly not prevent the abuse of office by a losing candidate who would return to the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.374" offset="3197276">The criminal statute, which prohibits abuse of office or abuse of official power, does not in any way affect the neglect of duties that could occur while an officeholder left his office and went out and ran for another office in the middle of his term.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.973" offset="3395702">And I certainly see an analogy between that and the provisions of both the federal Hatch Act and the state Hatch Act, which also prohibits candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.495" offset="3433737">The plaintiffs in this case, the appellees here, argue that apparently the resign to run rule is defective because it is under-inclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.556" offset="3513985">The process at arriving at a decision through the legislature is always one of compromise, and certainly that was involved in the arriving at this resign to run rule, but to hold the resign to run rule unconstitutional simply because it makes too many exceptions would require that a statute or constitutional provision either go all the way in treating a problem or not attack the problem at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.651" offset="5994363">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Texas in Article XVI, Section 40, has a prohibition against dual officeholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.809" offset="6047026">That means that you cannot hold more than one lucrative office at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.129" offset="6068342">Article XVI, Section 65, is not a dual officeholding prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.850" offset="6095196">Article III, Section 19, started out as a dual officeholding provision, and in 1836, they added that clause,</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.491" offset="6141799">"during the term for which he is elected or appointed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.776" offset="6154860">That is what causes the problem in III, 19, that I will be discussing later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.228" offset="6176698">In terms of the legislative history here, Section 65 of Article XVI was passed in 1954, after the resolution of the legislature to place it on the ballot for the revision of the constitution at the general election, and its purpose, and if you look at the headnote, says it is a transitional article to provide for the staggering of elections between the various officeholders who had been granted four-year terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.966" offset="6299683">In 1958, the paragraph in question here in Section 65 was also made part of the constitution, and at exactly the same time, verbatim, the same clause came into Article XI, Section 11, that I will be discussing here in just a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.428" offset="6377528">There is no reason that I know, nor did the state advance any in the courts below, other than that it... well, the state in the court below simply said that it was going to prevent abuse of office, and therefore that is why the article was placed in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.906" offset="6459448">Now, the question was raised here this morning that the district court made an error of fact or of law in neglecting to mention Article XI, Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.947" offset="6503647">That was the provision enacted in 1958 which allowed cities in the state of Texas to give four-year terms to mayors and members of the city council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.473" offset="6557668">They had to vote it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.889" offset="6563415">They didn't give it automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.206" offset="6568639">Very few cities took advantage of that provision to give members of its city council four-year terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.781" offset="6610958">Perhaps counsel here in rebuttal can mention one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.566" offset="6622034">I don't know of any, but there may be some.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.435" offset="6633528">Certainly El Paso, Texas, where this case arose, did not take advantage of it, and where Judge Hudspeth sat at the time members of the city council and municipal courts only had terms of two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.428" offset="12401469">If you look at the state cases construing Article XVI, Section 65, you will not find a single case in which a person has been required to resign from an office in which they have made anything other than a clear and definite pronouncement of candidacy for another office.</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.659" offset="12510452">In fact, the election code was recently amended to provide that if you try to file for another office before January 1, and might thereby inadvertently violate Article XVI, Section 65, that your filing will be declined, and it will be refused, and that you can only file after January 1, between January 1 and the first Saturday in February, thereby preventing any inadvertent violation of Article XVI, Section 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.995" offset="12631764">Finally, also on the question of the burden, this case was decided on summary judgment, and the burden, if you use the rational basis test, was upon the plaintiffs to show that there was no rational basis for these provisions, and we have set forth in our brief several.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.492" offset="12713789">Number One, Article XVI, Section 65, applies to your basic entry level stepping stone political positions, the precinct and county level positions, thereby providing a possible basis would be that the people of the state of Texas thought that it is more likely that someone entering at that level would try to run in mid-term, trying to step up while trying to hold onto the office that he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.476" offset="12817756">They are entitled to make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.511" offset="12825802">Second, on statewide officials, such as the attorney general running for governor, they do not serve staggered terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.498" offset="12853805">They are all up at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.617" offset="12862269">Their terms expire at the same time, so they would only be running for another state office in the last year of their term, as provided in Article XVI, Section 65, anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.806" offset="12906990">We believe that the plaintiffs have not met their burden in this situation and that these provisions do not contravene the Constitution of the United States.</text>
