            <text syncTime="21.994" offset="224369">We bring before you this morning a constitutional law question involving the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.022" offset="256552">Nebraska's law prohibits the transportation of water into another state unless that state has reciprocal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.752" offset="295422">Colorado has no reciprocal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.718" offset="311304">In 1971 the Nebraska Department of Water Resources issued a well registration number for the well that is in question today.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.199" offset="357280">This registration filing noted on its face that the land in Colorado was to be irrigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.803" offset="395628">The well was then used by the Appellants' predecessors to irrigate the agricultural land in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.739" offset="423422">But later on in 1971, the Appellants purchased this land from their predecessors and renewed their intentions to irrigate the Colorado land.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.169" offset="481100">They obtained approval to proceed from the manager of the local water management district.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.416" offset="514119">This approval included the conveyance of water by pipeline from the well located in Nebraska to the Appellants' adjacent land in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.304" offset="549646">The well itself is located only a few feet from the Colorado state line.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.611" offset="1382847">The land upon which the water is to be used from the Nebraska well is immediately adjacent to and contiguous with the Nebraska land, as you will note on the map.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.207" offset="1509280">In 1976, the Nebraska Department of Water Resources issued a letter to the Appellants ordering them to cease transporting water from Nebraska into Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.718" offset="1555360">Suit was brought by Nebraska against the Appellants in the state court to enjoin them from irrigating the Colorado land from the Nebraska well.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.295" offset="1589633">At that point in time the Appellants argued that the law, the Nebraska law, was unconstitutional and was in violation of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.338" offset="1621815">The Nebraska Supreme Court, however, affirmed the state court's injunction and held the law constitutional, including the mandatory reciprocity requirements which were included in the Nebraska statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.301" offset="1673642">However, in that opinion Nebraska's Chief Justice Krivosha vigorously dissented on the reciprocity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.360" offset="1705930">This appeal followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.014" offset="1724529">Nebraska held that water is not an article of interstate commerce, and therefore the court concluded that the commerce clause did not apply to the reciprocity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.431" offset="1770191">The question before this Court today is whether water is a subject of commerce clause standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.725" offset="1803314">We know if this were any other natural resource the Nebraska statute requiring reciprocity would be unconstitutional under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.361" offset="1845842">This Court in the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company case said that a state cannot discriminate or unduly burden interstate commerce and that a mandatory reciprocity clause or requirement is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.527" offset="1902580">The question, then, is whether water is different from all other resources for commerce clause purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.413" offset="1946047">Nebraska argues that water is unique and should be exempted from commerce clause standards, and they argued this for three reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="464.674" offset="1995157">First, Nebraska has defined water under its state law as being publicly owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.720" offset="2007278">We acknowledge that in Nebraska water is publicly owned and that Nebraska is the public trustee of that water.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.243" offset="2561388">Since Nebraska is acting as a market regulator and not as a market participant, it is our position that Nebraska cannot discriminate against interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.796" offset="2651667">The second argument is that water is different because Congress by federal act has authorized the western states to restrict interstate transportation of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.058" offset="2696702">While Congress may enact such legislation, it is our position that it must do so in clear and unmistakable language.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.909" offset="2760127">Nebraska has relied for its basic references in connection with the federal laws on the Mining Act of 1866, the Desert Land Act of 1877, and the Reclamation Act of 1902, alleging that these acts constitute authorizations for the states to prohibit or restrict the interstate transportation of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.874" offset="3103899">But they did not say that the states had the power to preclude under interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.356" offset="3137858">It was directed to a joining of hands on those acts with the then current state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.166" offset="3169100">And in the Reclamation Act of 1902, Congress provided for the sale of public lands, the proceeds of which were to be used to fund the creation of irrigation projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.365" offset="3217897">Therefore, while we agree that Congress could authorize the states to prohibit water exports, much as they exempted the insurance industry under the McCarran amendment, it is clear that none of the acts cited by Nebraska exempt water from commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.342" offset="3289786">Finally, Nebraska argues that water is physically unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.746" offset="3299399">However, a western water law specialist, Professor Corker, would disagree with that theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.684" offset="3471180">Certainly, if they say it is subject to commerce within the state, they can't say it's not subject to commerce without the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.543" offset="5650629">It's our position that these compacts do not in any case, in any specific instance, represent a specific, clear language by the Congress to remove water from interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.429" offset="5702142">They simply are agreements or contracts between the states to help the states transport water back and forth among themselves, actually contrary to our position, because here Nebraska is attempting to keep water from being transported from Colorado into Nebraska, when the compacts generally are to allow water to go from one state to another by state agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.264" offset="5933482">Furthermore, our Chief Justice has said, in the opinion of the Sporhase case that reciprocity is unnecessary to carry out Nebraska's conservation goals.</text>
