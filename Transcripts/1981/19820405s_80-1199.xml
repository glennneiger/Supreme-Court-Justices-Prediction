            <text syncTime="10.558" offset="119668">Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employment practices are illegal if they are purposely discriminatory or if they have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.507" offset="175465">Section 703(h) of the Act however says that an employer may treat their employees differently pursuant to a seniority system if that system -- what was -- is not -- it was -- if -- provided that system is not racially discriminatory intentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.549" offset="271596">A seniority system that just has a racially discriminatory effect is not illegal under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.004" offset="305451">The Court of Appeals in this case held that Section 703(h) protected only those seniority systems that were adopted prior to the date the Civil Rights Act that was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.319" offset="358636">We reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.098" offset="369816">We hold that 703(h) applies to all seniority systems whether they were adopted before or after the date of the passage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.266" offset="422479">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun.</text>
