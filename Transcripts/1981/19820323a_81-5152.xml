            <text syncTime="56.228" offset="347586">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this honorable Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.318" offset="371932">This case comes out of the State of Alabama in reference to an arrest made on January 4, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.831" offset="414042">Now, the background, which I think is very important in all criminal cases, especially when the Fourth Amendment is involved, of the facts and circumstances applicable to the record generally turn... make the case turn one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.324" offset="479975">Now, there was a robbery, without question, on the 2nd day of December, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.369" offset="508187">Subsequent to that time, in the middle days of December a Charles Martin was arrested in reference to a completely different and separate rape and robbery, and he was in the county... or in the city jail in Montgomery, Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.167" offset="635351">There's no argument to that effect, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.683" offset="641411">In fact, one issue here is whether or not... there are several... how many people were involved in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.867" offset="670146">Initially--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="138.085" offset="675057">Well, today we're only really concerned about one of them, aren't we.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_m_beno" startTime="142.474" stopTime="257.052">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Beno</label>
            <text syncTime="142.474" offset="692611">--The fingerprints and the confession, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.052" offset="694910">And at the trial we didn't argue and did not move to suppress the fingerprints taken from the hotdogs and the package of sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.516" offset="736706">That's not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.469" offset="740572">The point here today is whether or not, first of all, there was an illegal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.295" offset="767844">That's a critical issue, because if there's no illegal arrest there's no need to be in front of the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.663" offset="833359">We have a situation where Mr. Martin said to the police officer, Mr. Mobley... I think if you'll refer to the record at page 7 of the record, his statement to the court was that he had heard... that's not in the appendix, that's in the record... he had heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.549" offset="876827">At which time I moved or I objected, and there was a discussion in front of the court and in front of the officer, and during that discussion the judge came to the conclusion and stated that, well, I think that this, what he heard from someone else, if it cannot be substantiated, certainly cannot be grounds to base a credibility upon which an arrest can follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.039" offset="982780">Well, if you'll notice, on page 15... no, on page 13 of the record, after this discussion is over we come back and we ask Mr. Mobley another question, and now he says:</text>
            <text syncTime="233.452" offset="1056445">"Well, I don't know where he got it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="239.981" offset="1082567">"I don't know where he got it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="240.294" offset="1083821">This certainly... the element of credibility is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.229" offset="1095628">Once in front of the court and the court has said that, well, just hearing this is not sufficient, it appears that his testimony changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.899" offset="1126244">I think that's critical, because credibility is very important when this court decides this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.991" offset="1146620">At any rate--</text>

            <text syncTime="258.240" offset="1155606">The question presented that you framed in your brief is whether or not a confession taken from Petitioner following a warrantless arrest based on less than probable cause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert M. Beno</label>
            <text syncTime="278.637" offset="1237212">Now, Mr. Martin, who was as I said an alleged... or a suspect in a separate and completely different rape and robbery, was then questioned at the police station by Mr. Mobley, all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.117" offset="1283188">Now, he said, and it's on the record, that he had heard such and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.148" offset="1303250">The court then said: Well, hearsay is fine if it's credible and can be substantiated or give some credibility in reference to the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.829" offset="1361973">Well, the question was asked to Mr. Mobley, was there anything that you can base your credibility or you can give credit... credibility to the informant?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.261" offset="1407740">Well, Your Honor, all he told me was that he had heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.698" offset="1421428">He did not tell me who he heard it from or how he got this knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.992" offset="1438668">I would suggest, based on that and quite frankly until this brief by Petitioner... I mean, by Respondent... it has never been argued that there was probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.440" offset="1500422">In fact, at the oral argument in front of the Supreme Court of Alabama he readily admitted that there was no probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.670" offset="1529366">In fact, one of the judges at that time indicated that, well, I was kind of thinking about reversing this case, but if you admit that there's no probable cause I'm going to have a little bit more difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.337" offset="1575968">Well, now he suggests, and he tries to gloss over this failure to produce probable cause by saying that, well, we did have probable cause perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.491" offset="1608673">He says that this Mr. Martin was a suspect in the robbery at Moseley's Grocery Store at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.659" offset="1653291">Well, the record indicates that the only reason he was a suspect is because he was arrested on some other robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.733" offset="1689653">And another time in the record he says, well, he was a suspect to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.715" offset="1693519">He never indicates any reason on which to base his suspicion that Mr. Martin was even a suspect, other than the fact that he was in jail on another crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.448" offset="1728419">I don't believe that can be sufficient evidence on which to give credibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.850" offset="1758094">Simply that he knew that Omar Taylor was involved in the robbery of Moseley's Grocery Store.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.472" offset="1792575">That is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.925" offset="1794352">Nothing further to indicate any amount of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.672" offset="1829356">Dunaway falls very close to this case in reference to the fact that there was no evidence on which to substantiate the testimony or the statement made by the alleged individual incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.696" offset="1893408">One thing I want to point out.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.579" offset="3356997">In other words, they went to a magistrate and indicated that we have the possibility of determining the murderer of an eighth grade child, because we found a ring which has fingerprint on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.707" offset="6261500">The one issue that the Court of Criminal Appeals considered was, is a voluntarily given confession admissible in an instance where there is less than probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.577" offset="6320954">And what the Alabama appellate court did was to look at Dunaway and Brown and to weigh the facts, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals found nothing to distinguish Omar Taylor's case from Brown and Dunaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.288" offset="6383857">Then on appeal the Alabama Supreme Court reviewed the decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.832" offset="6421996">The Alabama Supreme Court found that the causal connection between the illegal risk and the confession had been sufficiently broken, and that any taint of an illegal arrest had been sufficiently attenuated by the three factors as set forth in Brown and Dunaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.684" offset="6505379">And what I would first like to do is to look at these three factors as set forth in Brown and Dunaway, and to see the correctness of the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.864" offset="6558146">The three factors:</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.656" offset="6609346">First of all, the first factor is the temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.141" offset="6615197">In both Brown and Dunaway, the Defendant was arrested and had confessed in less than two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.070" offset="6686982">In Taylor's case there was a period of six hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.601" offset="6689072">And in order to show the importance of the six-hour period, we have to look at the circumstances that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.208" offset="6715508">We know that there are four things that occurred during this period of time, and we know the approximate time, or the record shows the approximate time in three of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.970" offset="6746541">When Omar Taylor was arrested at 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon and taken directly to the police station, the first thing that happened, he was processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.061" offset="6790949">He was fingerprinted, he was photographed, and by his own statement they talked to him for 15 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.590" offset="6812997">We know then that he was taken directly to a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.882" offset="6842149">According to Omar Taylor's estimate, this lineup lasted one hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.800" offset="6897842">Then, ten minutes later, Detective Wilson read him his Miranda rights and confronted him with the fingerprint comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.594" offset="6913098">While he was being placed in the lineup, the police officers had taken the latent print from the crime scene, they had compared them with these roll prints, and he was confronted with these prints and he declined to make any statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.026" offset="6970776">He was then placed in his cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.868" offset="6990107">Then Omar Taylor says, that afternoon I talked to my girlfriend and I confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.052" offset="7018842">But it was not the girl... but it was not that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.785" offset="7033784">If you look at the record, his confession came at 9:00 p.m. that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.344" offset="7072027">So if you add up this time between 3:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. that night, some six hours, the activities that occurred immediately after his arrest consumed some two and a half hours, approximately, or three hours at the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.400" offset="7140259">But this leaves a three-hour period, and this is important, I think, from the length of time, because during this period he sat in the solitude of his cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.707" offset="7205460">He had an opportunity to compose his thoughts and to ensure that the confession was a product of his free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.907" offset="7226254">The second factor to be considered, intervening circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.998" offset="7254675">In Brown and Dunaway there were none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.090" offset="7275051">But I think there are several circumstances that are significant and should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.400" offset="7296262">First of all, I use the period of solitude in his cell as an example to show what happened to him during this six-hour period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.350" offset="7328027">But I think as an intervening circumstance we would have to consider this period of solitude in his cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.751" offset="7381630">His Miranda rights were read to him or given to him on three occasions, and the final time was just minutes before he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.436" offset="7412455">Omar Taylor was a twelfth grade student, and just before making his confession the police also read him his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.179" offset="7471387">He gave him a copy, Omar Taylor read it and signed the waiver of rights form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.303" offset="7495837">Another intervening circumstance is the visit between Omar Taylor's girlfriend and neighbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.207" offset="7515482">There is a difference in the versions of exactly what happened when you look at the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.329" offset="7544007">Omar Taylor gives a different version from that of the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.638" offset="7569189">According to the police officer, at 8:50 p.m. that night he took Omar Taylor out of his cell, read him his Miranda rights, and had been talking to him for approximately ten minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.695" offset="7625405">At that time Omar Taylor's girlfriend and neighbor arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.772" offset="7641810">She wanted to talk to Omar Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.704" offset="7689457">Omar Taylor wanted to talk to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.204" offset="7691442">So the police officer allowed them to have a private conversation in the detective's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.688" offset="7697398">After this private conversation, approximately ten minutes, Omar Taylor confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.733" offset="7717565">But I think that as an intervening circumstance you would have to consider the conversation, in which Omar Taylor was free to discuss anything in the privacy there with a person with whom he was very closely associated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.226" offset="7783602">And the last intervening circumstance which is given weight by the Alabama Supreme Court... and this is prior to the confession... an arrest warrant was obtained based on an affidavit that the officers made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.733" offset="7873568">This affidavit included information about the fingerprint information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.698" offset="7897496">The arrest warrant was issued prior to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.602" offset="7925082">During the exclusion... during the motion to exclude the confession, this evidence pertaining to the issuance of the search warrant was placed before the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.471" offset="7980566">During this hearing the information was before him that these fingerprints were used as a basis for the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.923" offset="8014316">There was no specific objection on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.123" offset="8027168">The first time that the fingerprint issue arose was in the trial itself, when the district attorney attempted to introduce into evidence a comparison of the fingerprints from the roll prints and the fingerprints from the crime scene, at which time the trial court sustained the objection and ordered the Defendant re-fingerprinted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.690" offset="8133434">Didn't I detect something in the record about a request on his part during this period for an attorney?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas R. Allison</label>
            <text syncTime="2010.219" offset="8163527">There is a conflict of testimony on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.561" offset="8180873">The two police officers that testified both stated, no, he did not ask for an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.464" offset="8204487">Detective Hicks very clearly testified on two occasions, no, he never requested an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.412" offset="8252344">So what you have, I think that when the trial judge considered the totality of the circumstances, he was considering two things when he considered this first motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.063" offset="8314933">He was considering also a Fifth Amendment question, the voluntariness of that confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.465" offset="8348579">And in considering all the facts and circumstances surrounding it, I think that the trial judge had to consider this conflict of testimony between the officer and then the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.492" offset="8388598">The Defendant said a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.086" offset="8391002">He said, I signed the statement of rights form after I confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.677" offset="8413362">But then when he was shown the date on it, he changed the story and said, no, I believe I signed the statement of rights form before I confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.924" offset="8442411">But I would say that there you have a direct conflict of testimony that had to be resolved by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.749" offset="8485669">The third factor that I would like to look at is the purpose and the flagrancy of the official misconduct of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.537" offset="8560797">I want to compare the conduct of the officers in this case with that in Davis v. Mississippi, Dunaway and Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.302" offset="8563932">In Davis, the police officers had a latent fingerprint from a crime scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.984" offset="8618580">The only description the rape victim could give was that it was a young Negro youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.812" offset="8625895">That was all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.109" offset="8631119">The police go out in a dragnet situation and arrest some 24 people, in a complete absence of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.402" offset="8664242">In Dunaway, the officers maintained that the defendant was simply detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.088" offset="8695067">They did not arrest him, they maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.150" offset="8699246">They merely took him to the police station for interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.896" offset="8718264">The information in Dunaway came from a person being held in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.143" offset="8747207">It passed through several hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.502" offset="8768732">We find a completely different situation when you look at the fact situation in Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.079" offset="8782943">In Brown, Brown was nothing more than an associate of a murder victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.715" offset="8821500">He was not even a real suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.089" offset="8831008">And yet the officers go to his apartment at 7:30 at night, they search his apartment without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.539" offset="8856817">They jump out and arrest him, and they arrest him in such a manner that would cause fright and shock and confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.425" offset="8888373">They take him to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.970" offset="8914600">He has confessed in less than two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.391" offset="8924213">In Taylor's case, the investigation had focused on one individual, Omar Taylor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.770" offset="12757735">I understand that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.705" offset="12765467">But certainly you're not going to... it's not going to be contended that because of the number of cases on the police blotter that a police group can go out, even when there is time, in fact time to go to a magistrate or at least contact a district attorney or something of that nature to determine whether or not, based on the bald statement of an alleged rapist and robber, that you can go out and make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.301" offset="12903916">I don't think this Court is going to come to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.081" offset="12914992">If this was a case where after the information came in to him he had immediately gone out based on that and in good faith made an arrest, that might have been a situation where it was simply a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.606" offset="12969117">This is not a case where there is simply a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.199" offset="12979462">This is a case where the police obviously knew that they did not have probable cause, that they had time to make a determination... have a determination made as to whether or not there was probable cause, that the only purpose that the Defendant was picked up in this case was in order to find out whether or not they could, through their flagrant and purposeful measures, whether or not they could bring in certain evidence during the detentionary period on which to hold the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.027" offset="13130763">That is certainly the only fact before you in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.854" offset="13146123">If this Court is of the opinion that the police can purposefully and when knowing they have no probable cause go out and pick up an individual in order to determine through investigation of that defendant's condition at the police station whether or not they have a case against the defendant, then we're in a situation where the exclusionary rule no longer serves a deterrent purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.215" offset="13271511">Certainly the medication served by the exclusionary rule is not a pleasant one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.853" offset="13310068">But the interest of society in protecting them from abusive conduct and extraordinary conduct on the part of the police must be balanced against the need to protect society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.488" offset="13372657">And in this case there is no evidence that the officers in this case acted in any other way than flagrantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.138" offset="13427201">And the time period involved certainly does not take this case out of Dunaway.</text>
