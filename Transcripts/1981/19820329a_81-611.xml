            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="180.616" offset="722442">I thought it was pretty clear that if her privacy could be guaranteed, then she would have no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.256" offset="736967">Now, could her privacy be guaranteed in any other way than what was done here?</text>

            <text syncTime="192.237" offset="768940">--Well, I don't think her privacy could be guaranteed by what was done here if by privacy we mean disclosure of potentially embarrassing facts, because this statute doesn't reach the problem that is covered by that kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.402" offset="829544">Beyond that, I am not sure from what I described as an uninformative, and I think it is an uninformative colloquy that took place in chambers after these orders were entered, precisely what her concerns about privacy were.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.913" offset="875624">After all, that colloquy dealt with the prosecutor's representation to the court concerning what the victim them had said to her, the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.768" offset="931004">Before that, at the time the hearing took place before a single justice, the representation was that the prosecutor had consulted fully with the victims, and that literally on their behalf the Commonwealth was waiving whatever rights it had under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.433" offset="993698">At most, I would suggest, Mr. Chief Justice, that that colloquy and its dimensions illustrate the critical need for a hearing in cases like this, so that questions like the one you have just asked can be answered on some kind of a factual record which lets people know precisely what is going on and what the precise concerns of the victim are.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.421" offset="1117623">As I understood it, the trial judge, under the statute, if he is to follow it, has absolutely no choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.382" offset="1189512">That is a reason in our judgment, and we suggest strongly to you that this statute is invalid, and in response to the Chief Justice's questions, I was suggesting that this kind of colloquy and the kinds of problems that are demonstrated by that kind of colloquy illustrate the need for a hearing before some kind of an order of closure can be entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.788" offset="1503086">Yes, I would, and I think that the reason for challenging it is that, given the fact that there is, as this Court two terms ago said there was, a First Amendment right to attend, then something more than the desire of the victim, standing alone, or a private session has to be demonstrated before the presumptive right of the public to attend can be overborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.151" offset="1616562">Any other view of the matter puts the extent of the press's and the public's First Amendment rights wholly in the hands of someone else, and it seems to me that that is not what this Court has ever interpreted the First Amendment to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.198" offset="1956780">In order to achieve the interests that the Commonwealth apparently seeks to achieve, as I understand those interests, one would in effect have to have a uniform rule closing virtually the entirety of these trials, because if we look at what those interests are, at least as I understand them, it seems to me that the predominant interest is an interest in privacy of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.292" offset="2089064">Now, I question whether privacy really is a relevant concept when we are talking about this kind of a proceeding, a criminal proceeding, but assuming that it is, and if we further look at what is inherent in the notion of privacy, we come to the conclusion that what is involved, what the Commonwealth is attempting to protect, is some restriction on the dissemination of potentially embarrassing facts, and that is the element of privacy that we are talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.602" offset="10354312">In the course of my brother's argument, I believe he took false aim at the main purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.101" offset="10368313">The main purpose of the statute is not to confer a generalized privacy upon the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.426" offset="10401646">Essentially the purpose is to give her some protection against the trauma of her testimony at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.970" offset="10427873">Further, through that kind of assurance by means of a mandatory statute, the legislature attempts to bring forward, to encourage the reporting and the prosecution of this particular category of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.700" offset="10486700">Again, this particular category of crime is characterized by a reluctance of victims, especially young victims and their families, to come forward and to endure the process of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.658" offset="10578547">A number of the students of this subject have suggested that the criminal justice system itself ironically imposes a second round of physical and psychological pain upon the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.125" offset="10596415">Indeed, a number of the writers recount the ordeal of a victim, a young victim and her family as they approach the trial process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.809" offset="10639151">Typically, the victim will have to visit the police station, the district attorney's office, identification, go through identification procedures, and, of course, at the time of trial itself confront the alleged rapist and undergo cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.989" offset="10707905">Typically, too, the victim will experience a number of trial continuances, and this will protract her inhibition, her embarrassment, and very often it will cost the prosecution the value of her assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.638" offset="12306495">It is a just result, acquittal or conviction, which is the special concern of the state, and the state, we say, may pre-empt the risk of even a mature minor who has abundant confidence in her ability to testify effectively, the state may pre-empt the risk of her appearance in front of a full courtroom containing members of the press in a situation in which she might succumb to stress or otherwise compromise her testimony, compromise the quality of that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.861" offset="12423419">There is perhaps one... and a third dimension to the answer on waiver, Your Honor, and that is very simply that even a waiver offer by the victim would require probably some kind of hearing on the part of a trial judge to assure himself that her waiver was knowing, voluntary, and wise or intelligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.665" offset="12510563">In those circumstances, again, the victim is drawn into another preliminary hearing at which the issue is her capacity to testify and perhaps her psychological strength or stamina.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.143" offset="12896549">If I may, I would like to stress just one more point, and that is a mode of analysis which Mr. Justice Brennan introduced in the Richmond Newspapers case, when he suggested that we should test statutes of this kind by inspection as to whether they interfere seriously with the flow of information to citizens about their courts or about their political institutions more generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.318" offset="13021205">I believe that the Supreme Judicial Court has tried very hard to shrink this statute to fit its essential purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.112" offset="13040431">Indeed, if we examine the remainder of the trial open to the public, it is very considerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.905" offset="13075540">All pre and post-trial proceedings remain open, presumptively open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.091" offset="13096333">Empanelment of the jury, opening remarks, testimony of all other witnesses, and typically there are five other categories of witnesses... police, medical and scientific evidence, prosecution corroboration witnesses, defense evidence and defense corroboration and alibi witnesses... in addition, summation to the jury, jury instructions, rendition of the verdict, all court papers, the appellate process, all of these elements of the judicial process remain open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.936" offset="13235722">My brother suggested that the statute might be self-defeating because it left so much of the proceeding open, but again, if one zeroes in on the very precise purpose of the statute, simply to give the child an enclave at the moment of testimony, I think one grasps the true purpose of the statute, and appreciates the effort of the Supreme Judicial Court to leave the remainder of the trial and the judicial proceeding all but entirely open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.909" offset="13347631">Just to sum up then, we suggest that on other occasions the press itself has recognized the social value of some confidentiality, particularly in cases or in legislation where it sought to shield the identity, for example, of reporters' sources, and argued that such confidentiality produced socially beneficial results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.275" offset="13432999">Today, the government is arguing that some reasonable confidentiality for children, victim to crimes of sexual assault, serves equally important purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.725" offset="13470824">We believe that the Supreme Judicial Court decision below respects both values, both the purposes, the practical and humane purposes of the statute, and the First Amendment.</text>
