            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132971">We will hear oral arguments first this morning in Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition against the City of Berkeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.214" offset="181768">Mr. Parrinello, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="18.040" offset="205069">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the question presented by this case is whether limits on contributions to ballot measure campaign committees violate the First Amendment guarantees of speech and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.658" offset="283541">Berkeley law limits to $250 the amount that a citizen may contribute to support or oppose a ballot measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.950" offset="320739">This case arose out of a 1977 Berkeley election where voters were asked to accept or reject a proposal which would have enacted rent control in the city of Berkeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.462" offset="370790">Groups of citizens associated together to oppose the rent control ballot measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.521" offset="395031">Under Berkeley law, that citizen association was deemed to be a campaign committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.503" offset="418960">The committee solicited and received contributions in excess of $250.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.704" offset="447694">Shortly before the election, the city decided that those contributions violated the campaign contribution limit, and it ordered the committee to immediately forfeit the excess funds to the city treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.526" offset="503074">Believing that the forfeiture would impair its ability to communicate its message to the electorate prior to election day, the committee and its supporters filed suit and sought and obtained preliminary injunctive relief in the superior court, and used the additional funds to communicate its message to the voters prior to the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.502" offset="586979">Thereafter, the committee moved for and obtained summary judgment in the superior court, which held that the campaign contribution limit violated the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.606" offset="635358">The California Court of Appeals, by a vote of three judges to none, affirmed the summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.213" offset="661794">The California Supreme Court, by a vote of four judges to three, reversed, splitting on the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.757" offset="691991">The majority opinion of the California Supreme Court failed to reconcile itself with, or even to recognize, a prior decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which struck down virtually identical ballot measure contribution limits in the state of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.640" offset="763462">That unanimous opinion of the Fifth Circuit, entitled Let's Help Florida v. McCrary, is now pending before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.309" offset="794182">It is important to emphasize that this case involves ballot measure campaigns and ballot measure campaign committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.149" offset="829500">It does not involve candidate campaigns for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.835" offset="844233">A limitation on the amount that citizens may contribute to a ballot measure campaign committee simultaneously affects the exercise of fundamental First Amendment rights in a number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.127" offset="897418">The effects can best be viewed as two sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.297" offset="918107">On the one hand, ballot measure contribution limits impair the ability of citizens to associate together, to communicate their message to the voters as effectively as possible on an issue of public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.010" offset="972964">On the other hand, these limits under attack here deprive the public of vitally needed information and restrict their access to the marketplace of ideas at the time when they need it most, when they are being asked to decide issues for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.643" offset="1039524">The sole and only purpose of a ballot measure contribution is to purchase or enhance communication of the message to the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.186" offset="1085709">The sole and only purpose of a limitation on ballot measure contributions to limit or to restrict that vital communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.367" offset="1142342">Your Honor, I believe that in our case, it's very similar to First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti because there the court held that in the context of a ballot measure campaign, there is no legitimate governmental interest to support restrictions on First Amendment rights in the form of campaign spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.875" offset="1228442">If anything, the restrictions here are more onerous than the restrictions in Bellotti because they affect the rights of citizens or national persons as well as the rights of corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.726" offset="1315795">Yes, it would, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.506" offset="1322901">Justice O'Connor, the principal reason that the argument would be the same is that in the context of a ballot measure campaign, there's no legitimate compelling governmental interest to support any restriction on the citizen's ability to communicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.217" offset="1397820">In the context of a ballot measure campaign, a proposal embodied in such a measure, in such a ballot measure, may target any number of citizens' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.806" offset="1448184">And the ability of citizens to communicate their ideas with respect to a ballot measure is important to the public's right to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.286" offset="1486114">It seems to us that there is no legitimate governmental interest to be supported.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.396" offset="1806480">They would be responsible for the acts of the association, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.644" offset="1831453">Although it would frankly be unlikely that they would be held responsible for such acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.439" offset="1850679">But that's as a matter of likelihood of the acts taking place, rather than any principle of law that insulates them from acts of individuals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_r_parrinello" startTime="446.478" stopTime="827.682">
            <label>Mr. James R. Parrinello</label>
            <text syncTime="446.478" offset="1918806">I believe that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.728" offset="1923822">The purpose of a ballot measure campaign committee is to express the community of interest or the joint political beliefs of the contributors or association members.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.425" offset="1982649">In today's society, as this Court has noted, speech or communication costs money, and it is the pooling of individual resources in the form of campaign contributions to a ballot measure committee that enhances the effectiveness of that communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.651" offset="2059554">Ballot measures are often complex and post complex issues, which if enacted will have effects that are unknown to the average voter, or are difficult for the average voter to perceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.300" offset="2134160">These effects are best ascertained by research, which is best purchased by committees which have the ability to conduct that research through the resources gained by the pooling of their contributors' contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.964" offset="2200824">The committee then communicates to the voters the results of that research, together with data, facts, opinions and reasoning of its contributors for a single purpose; to advocate the passage or the rejection of a ballot measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.661" offset="2279609">These communications in today's society cost money; they take the form of mailings, newspaper advertisements, television or other media advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.328" offset="2322241">This ballot measure contribution limit, by restraining that form of communication, imposes substantial restraints upon the exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.339" offset="2370307">Ballot measures often deal with issues and ask the voter to decide issues which affect the property, private property rights, which affect the community in which we live.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.380" offset="2422447">Indeed, these types of ballot measures often touch people's lives directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.253" offset="2445957">The ballot measure process is a form of direct democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.486" offset="2466855">It is where the citizens decide for themselves issues of public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.233" offset="2493813">Citizens in this form of democracy act as legislators, but they do not have the resources available to them that legislators have to determine whether or not to approve or reject certain proposed laws, because they do not have legislative staff and staff expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.584" offset="2567270">It is particularly in the context of a ballot measure campaign where the citizens have to decide important issues for themselves that it is important for them to have free access to all competing points of views.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.017" offset="2620978">Any restriction on that access to information cannot be justified, particularly in the context of a ballot measure campaign where First Amendment rights deserve perhaps the greatest protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.903" offset="2668520">Ballot measures are inanimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.041" offset="2681059">Unlike a candidate, they have no voice and they have no personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.305" offset="2698091">As a result, ballot measures often suffer from low visibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.835" offset="2712302">In this context a ballot measure campaign committee is the agent and voice of its contributors and members for a single purpose; to communicate a message to the voters to vote for or against the proposal contained in the ballot measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.563" offset="2783146">The City of Berkeley argues that even though citizens may be limited by this contribution limit... that's $250.00... that those same citizens may spend money as much as they desire to communicate their views, so long as the citizens spend that money independently of all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.819" offset="2860155">But it is not what First Amendment rights Berkeley has allowed the citizens to continue to exercise; it is what they have taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.051" offset="2893173">And the right that away is perhaps the only effective mean most have to participate in the ballot measure campaign process.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.093" offset="2941343">That is the right to contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.888" offset="2948449">A simple example will illustrate this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.449" offset="2966734">The largest single contributor to the committee here contributed $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.963" offset="2988782">That $5000, if spent independently, would have been able to purchase less than a third, approximately a third, of a single mailing to all the voters in the City of Berkeley at the time of this 1977 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.550" offset="3055133">Because as the record indicates, a single mailing to all Berkeley registered voters at the time of this election cost almost $13,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.374" offset="3086375">So what we are saying is that the exercise of this right to independently campaign or to have unlimited expenditures is a right that only the very wealthy citizens can enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.541" offset="3135067">And indeed, there are very few other citizens who even though they possess that right can exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.617" offset="3159413">I would like to, by way of example, show two other effects of this ballot measure contribution limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.175" offset="3205598">Such a limit would prohibit two Berkeley citizens who share a common view for or against a ballot measure from spending $300 each to purchase a newspaper ad, where each of those two citizens advocates the passage or defeat of a ballot measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.511" offset="3274979">The limit would prohibit 20 citizens from spending $600 each to purchase the postage and writing materials and printing materials necessary for those 20 citizens to send the informational pamphlet to Berkeley voters, communicating their joint interest in opposing or supporting a ballot measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.987" offset="3372886">The net effect and purpose, the net effect of a contribution limit such as this will ultimately frustrate people from participating in the political process because it takes away from them the only effective means that they have to participate, particularly in the context of a ballot measure.</text>

            <text syncTime="842.707" offset="3503707">The distinction between the ballot measure campaign and the candidate campaign is that there is no governmental interest of vital importance that is served by a ballot measure contribution limit; no logical connection between a ballot measure contribution and its target... the restriction of the flow of communication to the voters... and any compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.307" offset="3602137">As this Court has indicated in Buckley, there is such a nexus or a compelling governmental interest with respect to candidate contribution limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.246" offset="9965879">We thought one approach would be to require the disclosure of the big contributors as part of the communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.445" offset="10010705">But then you get to a point where the disclosure, in fact, overwhelms the communication.</text>

Management Company, Southern Alameda County Board of Realtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.465" offset="10114777">The disclosure is part of the content in a campaign context, and this Court recognized that in Bellotti.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.711" offset="10151766">Striking down the prohibition against corporate expenditures, the Court pointed out that corporate advertising is likely to be highly visible, that the corporate identity will help the voters evaluate the source of the message to make a well-informed decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.003" offset="10216968">That's the goal that we're trying to achieve in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.938" offset="10228671">Now another disclosure possibility would be to enact an ordinance that would require the campaign committee to state the title of the message and its position on the measure, and that would avoid the problem with the act of misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.119" offset="10301395">But nevertheless, it doesn't further the disclosure because all you get is something along the lines of Committee for Smoking and Non-Smoking Sections, No on 5, but you don't know who it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.098" offset="10349356">So I would submit that in fact the city has considered disclosure alternatives, and and we have not been able to identify an alternative that serves the... furthers the purpose in a content-neutral way in the way that this type of a limitation does.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.564" offset="11155182">First, campaign committees that are going to raise money and participate in local campaigns must raise funds from a greater number of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.498" offset="11198963">This has a very direct impact in broadening the base of support and participation in ballot measure campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.994" offset="11224876">Second, individuals who care to participate in a campaign by spending more than $250 must do so by making direct expenditures, not contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.895" offset="11272524">This increases the range and diversity of ideas that are expressed in the marketplace of ideas; that in fact furthers the governmental interest to promote involvement with citizens in helping them understand the issues that they're being called upon to debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.998" offset="11348906">We're not seeking to stifle debate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.683" offset="11359668">We're not seeking to cut off voices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.463" offset="11370744">What the City of Berkeley is trying to do is to make the initiative as representative of a broad base of people as possible, to provide information to the voters so that they can understand the diverse issues that are present in a ballot measure campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.223" offset="11437827">I would submit that this is enough of an interest and enough of a showing to support what the city is trying to do here with its contribution limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.234" offset="11473875">The Court's decision in the case of California Medical Association is particularly instructive because the Court made it clear that... the plurality opinion... that contributions are far less of an infringement on protected rights than expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.693" offset="11575649">Now using the appropriate balancing test, the governmental restriction here can be supported by the interests that I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.748" offset="11643880">In Bellotti, this Court referred to the showing by the state of Massachusetts and indicated that Massachusetts had made no showing that the voice of corporations was overwhelming or even significant in ballot measure campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.147" offset="11717546">That particular sentence has been picked up and repeated by most of the courts that have considered the validity of contribution prohibitions and limitations in the ballot measure context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.565" offset="11767178">And I would submit that that is an over-broad reading of that sentence in Bellotti.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.703" offset="11791733">Again, Bellotti was looking at expenditure limitations, and that sentence implies that if you had evidence that the referenda process was being overwhelmed or significantly impacted by corporate expenditure, that you might even be able to support an expenditure limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.695" offset="11871668">Here we're dealing only with a contribution limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.380" offset="11882431">But if the Court wants to impose that strong a standard and require a showing that large contributions are overwhelming the political process and are causing some improper functioning of the initiative process, there are data beginning to evolve which shows that that may, in fact, be true, that very large campaign contributions channeled into the political process do not educate the voters, do not inform the voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.723" offset="12515848">But in the aftermath of Buckley, we recognized that equalization is not an appropriate goal, and that's where the expenditure limitations were invalidated, both the local and the state expenditure limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.342" offset="12562241">We're now left with a situation which is very comparable to the federal situation; a limitation on contributions and no limitation on expenditures.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.680" offset="14323626">The Berkeley ordinance in Section 206, again on page 60 of Jurisdictional Statement Appendix, defines contributions to that committee as a gift, subscription, loan, advance or anything of value made directly or indirectly in aid of or in opposition to a ballot measure.</text>
