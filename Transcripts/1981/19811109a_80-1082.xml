            <text syncTime="47.155" offset="266038">In this case, federal habeas corpus has been granted to a state prisoner and causes a so-called reprehensible prosecutorial error even though an -- an analysis of the case demonstrates that this error is not prejudicially accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.249" offset="326329">Thus, the issue that is presented here is whether this prosecutorial conduct, in fact, prejudicially accused and if did not prejudice him, whether a federal court to express disapproval of that conduct and grant habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.286" offset="390485">Also presented in this case is whether this Court should overrule long and well-settled precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.960" offset="417235">These precedents establish that the right to an impartial jury guaranteed by the Constitution is one which only requires the juries remain free from actual bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.433" offset="467076">The respondent wants this Court to replace that principle with one which requires removing of a sitting juror upon facts showing -- upon facts which might render a hypothetical juror biased even though it was shown that the particular jury in the case remained actually impartial.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.434" offset="591106">To place the -- that decision in context, I would like to go back to the state proceedings and then just bring it to the Second Circuit decision and Judge Pierce's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.470" offset="627259">But let me -- let me answer your question directly, Judge Pierce used the implied bias standard, the Circuit Court, I think, without regard to prejudice at all just said the prosecutor's error, there was prosecutorial error here, consequently there must be a reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.301" offset="758603">This case arose out of a -- a killing on Christmas Eve in 1968 when they have to unsuccessfully trying to extort money from a person, respondent William Phillips, then a New York City police officer, killed that person whom he was extorting, or sought to extort killed another eyewitness and sought to kill even -- killed an eyewitness and sought to kill a second eyewitness, that person survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.015" offset="849405">Three years later in 1971, respondent was indicted and his first trial in 1972 ended in a mistrial because of a hung jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.835" offset="884722">In 1974, he was brought to trial again and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.403" offset="903008">During the voir dire at the second trial, the defense found one John Dana Smith acceptable as a juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.641" offset="931952">Smith was a Vietnam veteran who's about to graduate Columbia College and he was accepted by the defense even though he worked as a security guard or a security position in Bloomingdale's and was then actively seeking a law enforcement job and at the time, had an application pending with the Federal Law Enforcement Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.014" offset="1009483">Subsequently during trial, Smith was having lunch with a friend, a court officer in a court that had nothing to do with this case, and they're sitting and talking, and the court officer who knew Smith's wife from John Jay College said, “I am applying for a job in the District Attorney's Office as an investigator, there may be some jobs there that you might be interested in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="253.369" offset="1090881">And so they asked about the jobs, they didn't know much about it but Smith said, “Well, how should I apply?”</text>
            <text syncTime="257.728" offset="1108330">And he says, “Well, write a resume and send a letter to the District Attorney's Officer and I'll find out more details on how to apply for you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.622" offset="1135916">And that's what Smith did a week later.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.317" offset="1142603">He sent a letter, saying, “I'm -- I hear you have positions open in a Major Felony Investigating Unit, I am interested,” signed John Dana Smith and sent his resume.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.015" offset="7313457">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.982" offset="7325264">I first want to apologize for what maybe a very hoarse voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.643" offset="7343968">It's something that I have picked up in Oregon two days ago and there's nothing much I can do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.875" offset="7376882">This case is a unique one, it was called that -- not only by myself in our brief, but it was called by the trial judge himself as unprecedented imprudence on the part of the prosecutor, unique misjudgments by the prosecutor, extraordinary about the submission of the application for a job in the middle of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.136" offset="7489940">It involves essentially and I think Mr. Pitler has stated some of it, a juror applying for a job in the capital prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.412" offset="7531005">And his course to the application began on the very day that he was selected when he heard, even before other jurors had been seated when he heard in a lunch with court officers about the opening of a job on the major felony squad of the District Attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.730" offset="7612298">That was on I believe September 23, 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.929" offset="7633091">Mr. Kunstler, do you -- do you agree that the reasoning of the Court of Appeals was somewhat different than the reasoning of Judge Pierce?</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.482" offset="7671334">Justice Rehnquist, I do, but differently than Mr. Pitler does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.085" offset="7685754">Because I thought that what the Court of Appeals was doing in using Agurs has a standard was to say essentially that the prosecution's misconduct prevented the defendant from exercising a right that he had under 270.35.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.357" offset="7766838">That because he didn't know about it, he couldn't go to the trial judge at a time when removal of a juror is far simpler than it is after conviction and utilized that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.040" offset="7813545">And that statute does not say that you need an actual bias juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.864" offset="7832876">It says a juror, the fact that a juror is grossly unqualified to sit in the case, that's one standard or -- and I think that's what we have here, a juror engaged in misconduct of a substantial nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.360" offset="7926812">But I think one of the aspects of due process is preventing the utilization of available statutes -- remedial statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.059" offset="7961607">I think if a prosecutor engages in conduct that prevents that utilization, you have a substantial due process question that has not been fully briefed on either side here, but I think it's existent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.545" offset="8035586">I think a statute that gives you remedial right presents a due process situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.658" offset="8056066">The Second Circuit, if it's read the way Mr. Pitler is saying, it's saying under Agurs, you have right where something is withheld deliberately which may in some way affect your trial to utilize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.318" offset="8114685">And I think if you divorce the statutes out of it, 270.35, you can read another ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.578" offset="8139658">But I thought the Second Circuit was very much concerned about the fact that they were denied a right, that they had under State law to utilize which I think is a due process -- rises to due process proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.612" offset="8187827">If a right is existent under State law and the prosecutor deliberately prevents you form achieving that right, I think it's a due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.179" offset="8226071">But I'm not sure, Justice Rehnquist, which way the circuit went.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.760" offset="8240386">I don't think it's the most artful of opinions that I've ever read, and you can read it under Agurs and you can read it under my interpretation but either one, I accept it because they affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.190" offset="8682169">And they did bring him to the attention, a little late because they discovered it early in October, and they revealed it some time in November, I believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.981" offset="8745281">I mean that juror was excused with the consent of all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.492" offset="8759387">Judge had a hearing and excused that juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.369" offset="8774851">And, by the way the statute now reads must excuse then it was a --a may standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.027" offset="8793450">But, in any event, Phillips never got the opportunity to even have the may portion of the statute, put into operation because of failure to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.227" offset="8846322">To go on with the juror's conduct in this particular case, the day he sworn, he learned with the opening from court officers, he expressed as an interest, he gets the court officer to find out for him how to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.432" offset="8915076">And then the court officer goes to or calls the District Attorney's office, gets the procedure, ultimately finds out who's in charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.765" offset="8956454">The District Attorney by the name of Joan Sudolnik comes back to Mr. Smith, he says, “Here's how you do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.612" offset="8991876">Mr. Smith fills out an application form which is brief, it's in the record, it's very short, with a resume and then Mr. Fontaine takes it with the zone to the District Attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.426" offset="9039106">But apparently, the District Attorney said, “You must mail it in personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.256" offset="9054361">We don't accept another person's application from you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.406" offset="9070975">And so, he then stamped it and mailed it and it arrived on October 23rd in the District Attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.009" offset="9101382">The trial was then into the third of its seventh week at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.624" offset="9119876">His letter went to a District Attorney Convoy who refuted to Ms. Sudolnik who was in charged of personal recruitment at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.378" offset="9154881">She refuted to an assistant District Attorney, Lang who was Sudolnik's subordinate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.975" offset="9177241">And then there was a lot of communication between Lang and not only this court officer, but another one in which Lang is told that Smith is a juror in the Phillips trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.581" offset="9235756">So, whether Mr. Smith told him to tell that or Mr. Piazza or Mr. Fontaine did it on their own but both informed the District Attorney's office that Smith was a juror in that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.822" offset="9296673">I'm sure they both knew about it from meeting him in the courthouse and learned it from him or from courthouse gossip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.987" offset="9321333">But in any event, the District Attorney knew it very shortly after the application was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.770" offset="9348500">And then the District Attorney or at least the Assistant District Attorneys told the prosecutors on November 14th I believe, a week or so before judgment in this case or the juries verdict that there was a juror who was applying for a job.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.140" offset="9905953">In fact, there was one meeting on the 15th of November, the next day after the prosecutors discovered it, that Holmes, one of the District Attorneys who was involved in the processing of the application, what meant with Mr. LaPenta who was the second in command of the trial team and tried to talk to him about it and LaPenta told him, “I don't want to listen to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.260" offset="10094453">After verdict, he called Ms. Sudolnik up, he couldn't reach her, and so he got a friend of his, Mr. Reilly who ran and I think still does the Bloomingdale's security office in New York, he got Mr. Reilly to call up Ms. Sudolnik and Mr. Reilly said, “What gives with Smith's application?</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.941" offset="10169163">He was a juror and just completed Phillips trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.798" offset="10188598">And I think the implication of that statement were hardly lost on anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.434" offset="10207093">In any event, Ms. Sudolnik told him then that the juror's application would be considered in the normal course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.053" offset="10241574">That's the day after the jury's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.295" offset="10258606">The District Attorney, Mr. Q never learned of this until December 4th of 1974, some two weeks or so after verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.338" offset="10306776">When Mr. LaPenta told Mr. Q's assistant, John Keenan in an elevator in the federal building where Phillips had a habeas on another matter going told Mr. Keenan that one of the jurors had applied for a job during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.284" offset="10382531">Mr. Keenan told the District Attorney, Richard Q and then five days later, they informed the trial judge, and the trial judge did hold a hearing both on juror number three and juror number six.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.089" offset="10437702">So the sequence you have is that at least by the 13th of November, the District Attorney's office, many people knew that Smith was a juror in the Phillips case and that Smith had an application pending in the office.</text>

            <text syncTime="3676.755" offset="14784373">Listening to Mr. Kunstler described the case it has nothing to do with the relationship or reality or the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.334" offset="14806734">I mean, the suggestion that the prosecutors deliberately met and chose not to decide this -- discloses the Court, it's just not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.997" offset="14837349">What happened there is, that Mr. Litman was standing outside, Mr. Keenan's office to talk to him about another matter and Ms. Sudolnik came up to say -- to tell him this, he was in the middle of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.118" offset="14877891">She said, “Oh my god!</text>

            <text syncTime="3754.482" offset="15095334">At -- at pages -- the record makes clear throughout that he applied for that job on the 16th of October.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.466" offset="15135250">That was three weeks after he's been (Inaudible) about a juror and that's when he first found out about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.982" offset="15153326">So to try to create this impression of prosecutors running around and conspiring and the juror running around and actively -- see, is just not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.992" offset="15185300">It has no -- if you read our brief and if you read the record, you will see what happened here, you had an innocent, naive juror who was actually impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.367" offset="15218841">The Constitution requires no more, the state courts requires no more, and a federal courts sitting in habeas corpus review of the conviction certainly should require no more.</text>
