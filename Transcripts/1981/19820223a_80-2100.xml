            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="41.743" offset="166870">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="43.910" offset="175543">The question in this case is whether the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit duly followed this Court's decision in City of Mobile versus Bolden, in holding that the effect of that decision was to still retain the so... called Zimmer criteria of voting dilution as being sufficient to establish an inference rather than simply requiring a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.010" offset="280033">The appellants in this case respectfully submit that the court of appeals did not follow this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.500" offset="309917">This case was filed in 1976 and attacked as an unconstitutional dilution of Black voting rights the at-large method of electing the five county commissioners of Burke County, Georgia, which had been in effect continuously since 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.912" offset="387553">According to the 1970 census, Burke County has a population, or had a population of 18,235, 60.91 % of which were Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.471" offset="437812">This case was tried subsequent to the court of appeals' 1978 decision in Nevett v. Sides, holding that while discriminatory purpose must now be shown in a voting dilution case, that it could still be proven by the four discriminatory impact factors which had been identified in Zimmer versus McKeithen.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.455" offset="545750">However, the trial was before this Court's decision in Mobile holding that the Zimmer criteria were no longer sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.494" offset="581904">The trial court below specifically held that the 1911 law had not been enacted with a discriminatory purpose, and that Blacks had not been able to show a denial of specific voting processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.472" offset="657868">The court concluded, however, based upon the socio-economic factors of Zimmer which the court of appeals previously had resuscitated in Nevett II that the system, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="176.863" offset="707396">"is being maintained for invidious purposes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="179.732" offset="718890">Prior to the decision in the court of appeals on the appeal, this Court decided Mobile versus Bolden.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.837" offset="755252">Nevertheless, the court of appeals affirmed the district court, concluding that the Zimmer criteria or factors were still sufficient to establish an inference of discriminatory intent, but that the only effect of this Court's decision in Mobile had been that they were no longer sufficient to establish a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.969" offset="851801">And that secondly, a finding of responsiveness was now of major consideration in that without a finding of responsiveness, the Court said, there could be no establishment of dilution.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.044" offset="904150">This apparently was based upon the fact that in the Zimmer case, there had been no showing of lack of responsiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.049" offset="936124">In this case, the courts below relied upon the same three Zimmer factors which had been found insufficient in Mobile... slating, unresponsiveness and past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.559" offset="994220">The added factor relied upon here, which was socio-economic status that had been depressed, was also present in Mobile, although not denominated or articulated as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.502" offset="1053989">In fact, we submit that the evidence in this case was even stronger than it was in Mobile, for here, unlike Mobile, there was no evidence that there had been efforts to change the system, which as pointed out in Justice White's dissent in Mobile, had been done in such a manner as to indicate the possible inference of discrimination by the timetable or the manner in which the attempted repeal was made, as well as the effort to come in and bolster the system by in 1965 conferring executive responsibilities upon the three city commissioners in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.246" offset="1220963">Notwithstanding this, the court of appeals adhered to the socio-economic disparity impact analysis of the Zimmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.518" offset="1258057">In the companion case involving Thomas County, Georgia, the court specifically reversed a holding of the district court which said that Zimmer is no longer sufficient after the Supreme Court's decision in the Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.278" offset="1317094">We submit that the court of appeals erred in its evaluation of this Court's decision in Mobile, and we say that even assuming that the Zimmer analysis is still sufficient to establish purposeful discrimination, that the plaintiffs in this case failed to carry the burden, and the decision below is clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.095" offset="1424300">Firstly, we submit that under no reading of this Court's decision in the Mobile case, can this distinction between presumption versus inference that the court of appeals read into it be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.355" offset="1481352">Both in Nevett, which is a 1978 decision, as well as in its companion case of Mobile which later was decided by this Court, the court of appeals below stated the Zimmer test in terms of an inference, and applied it as simply one form of circumstantial evidence subject to the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.755" offset="1586991">It is significant I think that the plaintiffs do not make any belated or any great effort to support or to defend the decision of the court of appeals on this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.880" offset="1635474">The court's decision continuing to treat the Zimmer criteria as being sufficient is contrary to that court's own decision less than a month earlier--</text>

            <text syncTime="424.741" offset="1698900">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="425.091" offset="1700362">I think I was simply commenting when we recessed that the decision of the Fifth Circuit in this case was contrary to a decision of another panel of the same court less than a month earlier in the Escambia County, Florida case, and also, it is contrary to a recent decision of the Fourth Circuit which was decided about a month or so ago.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="441.033" offset="1764101">--The Eleventh Circuit, yes, sir, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.885" offset="1771520">With respect to the other part of the court's decision on the question of unresponsiveness, the appellants and the appellees are apparently in agreement that the court is in error with respect to that aspect of the holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.062" offset="1832229">We submit further, on behalf of the appellants, that while the matter of unresponsiveness was mentioned in White versus Regester without any discussion as to whether it was a proper subject for judicial resolution, that consideration of that type of inquiry should be precluded by the political question doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.562" offset="1938181">Justice Harlan stated it better than anyone in Whitcomb versus Chavis.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.033" offset="1960124">If there are less appropriate subjects for federal judicial inquiry, they do not readily come to mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.470" offset="1989799">Now, White versus Regester itself does contain the discriminatory intent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.126" offset="2020415">Zimmer, however, does not, and in footnote 16 of that decision, the Fifth Circuit stated unequivocally that the focus of the inquiry should be on the effect or impact of the legislation being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.168" offset="2088647">As applied to Burke County, Georgia, we submit that since the court below found that the at-large system was not enacted for a discriminatory purpose, that there is no basis for striking it down in this case without at the same time recognizing some constitutional basis of at least some degree of proportionate representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.234" offset="2192927">This is so, we submit, because the touchstone of dilution seems to be access.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.889" offset="2219468">The evidence here is that in Burke County Blacks have never had any difficulty registering, voting or getting on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.159" offset="2252591">Certainly, since the white primary was stricken down in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.563" offset="2274220">Plaintiff Lodge himself testified that Blacks are better organized politically in Burke County than Whites, that they hold rallies at churches, they have organizations that invite candidates, they even distribute a ticket--</text>

            <text syncTime="793.660" offset="3174609">I think the proper application of that is well illustrated by the decision of the Fifth Circuit itself in the Escambia County cases where the court considered that at the time Escambia County adopted at-large voting, it went to it right after there had been... the white primary had been stricken down there was some arguments made in the newspapers along racial lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="831.868" offset="3327373">But the fifth Circuit, of course, tried to rationalize that by, in effect, saying that Judge Alaimo anticipated Bolden and that he did find discriminatory intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="882.885" offset="3531442">However, in Burke County the evidence is that in the memory of no witness has any black person ever been unable to pass the literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.258" offset="3573029">Moreover, the evidence was that there had never been any effort to change the at-large system up until this case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.947" offset="3607719">We submit that in applying all of this, in light of the evidence in the case, the contention in this case ultimately gets down to this: and that is, is inaction unconstitutional; is there a constitutional duty on a political subdivision to continually assess its political structure and change it simply in order to favor one group that says that they are entitled to elect candidates of their choice?</text>
            <text syncTime="932.750" offset="3730913">We submit that the answer is no, and that's what this Court said in the City of Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.506" offset="3761946">We submit that the Zimmer analysis is incorrect not only because it reflects a discriminatory impact or disparate impact analysis, but also because of the methodology that it employs, in that it permits the court to grant relief in a voting-related case based upon violations in other areas, such as public education, public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.127" offset="3888483">We submit that in doing this, the court in the decision violates the rule that the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.499" offset="3929966">It puts the courts in the business of pronouncing condemnation rather than judgment in granting reparations rather than judicial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.855" offset="3963402">The tendency of the Zimmer analysis to become preoccupied with this very thing is demonstrated by what happened to it as an evolutionary matter in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.598" offset="4022335">Originally, there were four factors in the Zimmer analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.235" offset="4040934">One of those factors was slating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.354" offset="4053368">In an early case, Hendricks versus Josephs, the Fifth Circuit said this: It is the ability of Blacks to get on the ballot which is at the core of slating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.476" offset="4093806">Yet, in 1979 in Cross versus Baxter, the Moultrie, Georgia case and the Adarian case from McIntosh County, Georgia, the Fifth Circuit completely switched over and said no, it's a question of success, and that the effect of it was to tend to merge the issue of slating with a separate Zimmer factor of a history of prior discrimination which affects present ability of Blacks to have access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.028" offset="4220029">In this case, for example, the district court denied... or held that there was a... that the plaintiffs had established a lack of slating requirement, because of the fact that there were not anymore Blacks on the Democratic Executive Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.890" offset="4287530">This was inspite of the fact that the undisputed evidence was that these posts are filled by open election on the same single-member district basis that the plaintiffs were asking for in this case, aside from the fact that about the most unimportant and insignificant job in Georgia is being a member of a county Democratic Executive Committee in a rural county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.255" offset="4380944">They've never done very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.672" offset="4386586">They were originally... their original function was to conduct the primaries, and that was taken over by the probate court in 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="1115.419" offset="4461610">The complete submergence, however, of the three other Zimmer factors by the one dealing with a history of discrimination came in a 1978 decision of the Fifth Circuit in Kirksey versus Supervisors where a sharply-divided court held that it was now only necessary to show a past history of discrimination and show that that carried forward present effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.421" offset="4581669">The court in that case said that it was not even necessary to even consider Washington versus Davis and the question of discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.311" offset="4621166">In other words, this is a remedy case, not a violation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.515" offset="4637989">We submit that the bottom line of the Zimmer analysis which the Fifth Circuit has continued to apply in this case was and is, as the dissent in that case in the Fifth Circuit pointed out, reverse discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.874" offset="4699429">I would like now to address the question of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act which has been argued by the appellees and mentioned by I think all of the four amicus briefs that have been filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.634" offset="4758465">We submit that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not adopt a disparate impact standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.888" offset="4787513">This Court rejected that argument, we submit, in the Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.025" offset="4808098">The Fourth Circuit recently rejected it in the Columbia, South Carolina case in the same terms as has been submitted to this Court by essentially the same parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.065" offset="4852193">The Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit in this case rejected that argument at page 1364 in footnote 11, and there was no cross-appeal from that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.473" offset="4901825">And we submit that there are valid reasons independently of precedent for rejecting that construction of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.496" offset="4941949">First, you begin with a rule that you look at the language of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.500" offset="4965982">The language of the statute uses "deny and abridge", and as the district court in the Uvalde case recognized, these terms themselves connote intent or purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.409" offset="5017600">Secondly, the Section, in using deny or abridge utilizes the language of the Fourteenth Amendment, and most specifically, the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.782" offset="5059082">And those amendments have unquestionably been interpreted as imposing a discriminatory intent standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.104" offset="5088340">Thirdly, when Congress wanted to adopt a disparate impact analysis, it knew very well how to do so in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.912" offset="5135569">And, of course, the rule of statutory construction is that where in one statute Congress uses words in one section and it does not use them in another section, the inference is that it did not intend for that section to have the effect of the other sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.823" offset="5211220">Fourth, the statement of Attorney General Katzenbach that has been relied upon by appellees does not support the interpretation that they place upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.931" offset="5255628">The Attorney General was not asked whether or not, Section 2 had a disparate impact test, or a discriminatory purpose test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.137" offset="5292513">He was specifically asked whether or not the word 2 would cover a situation where a political subdivision simply just didn't open its registration offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.563" offset="5350191">The Attorney General replied, I suppose that you could if it had that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.384" offset="5373492">So here we have the Attorney General himself reading a discriminatory purpose requirement into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.140" offset="5404526">Now, it is certainly true that immediately after that, he proceeded to paraphrase the section, and in doing so, we submit, inadvertently utilized the language of Sections 3, 4 and 5 rather than the language of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.566" offset="5466175">The casualness, however, with which he did this invokes and brings into effect, we submit, what this Court held in Allen versus State Board of Elections, which was to the effect that in any case where the legislative hearings and debate are so voluminous no single statement or excerpt of testimony can be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.531" offset="5562096">In that case, the court applied that principle to disregard the statement of Assistant Attorney General Burton Marshall as to the meaning of voting as used in the Voting Rights Act, and held that the statute would be given a much broader scope than the words of the statute would themselves indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.511" offset="5642031">Now, weighed against this is the statement of Senator Dirksen,... stated twice, not just once, as this Court's opinion in Mobile had indicated, both at pages 171 and 208 of the record before the Senate... to the effect that Section 2 was simply a restatement of the Fifteenth Amendment, to which Attorney General Katzenbach acquiesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.327" offset="5745267">Fifth, we submit that as a policy matter, this Court should not construe Section 2 as having a disparate impact analysis in the absence of more compelling language or legislative history than the Court is confronted with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.621" offset="5814439">The reason for this is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.573" offset="5826247">Section 2 applies to all 50 states, not just to a few colored states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.461" offset="5845786">So being a disparate impact standard might well not have the limiting construction that this Court placed upon the effect, purpose and effect language in Section 5 in the Bier case where you held that the law was concerned only with laws that led to retrogression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.225" offset="5932826">Now, if you do not apply that restriction on the language in Section 2, this would place in doubt the validity of election codes, governmental organizations, the districting schemes and congressional districts, state legislative districts and local political subdivision districts all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.723" offset="6022792">It would also raise serious questions about the validity of candidate and voter qualifications, and possibly require a validation procedure similar to that used with respect to employment tests under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.385" offset="6097502">Moreover, imposing a disparate impact requirement on Section 2 would create a lot more mischief than it would even, for example, in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.959" offset="6147762">The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not purport to protect only certain people, whereas Section 2 does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.615" offset="6178377">And at least under the Fourteenth you would have to consider the impact on everyone, not just on a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.019" offset="6203977">Under 2, however, it protects only racial and language minority citizens, and a disparate impact test there would be almost mandate for reverse discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.867" offset="6291435">I think that one issue underlies every decision of this Court that has dealt with this matter of legislative reapportionment of racial discrimination, starting with Whitcomb and going to White versus Regester, Burns versus Fordsen and the Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.858" offset="6343367">That issue is when the normal political process is going on in any community, when there is the regular give and take and black people or any racial minority may lose at the polls in that circumstance, that's too bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.202" offset="6404807">And that's part of the political process, that's the give and take that I think Justice Stevens is talking about in the Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.439" offset="6425704">It's not the role of this Court to sit back as the political arbiter for the United States and say well, there are not enough Blacks elected in this county, there's not enough in this county and so on and intercede.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.478" offset="6465829">That's obviously a political question and is not a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.098" offset="6480353">But I think the one thing that does characterize all of the Court's decisions and starting with Whitcomb versus Chavis where again there was complete intercourse politically among Blacks and Whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.823" offset="6527269">Black people and white people were in all the parties together, they ran together, they were slated together and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.208" offset="6544823">And the difference is when black people, when the racial minority is totally excluded from the political process on account of purposeful discrimination, you've got a constitutional problem and you don't have the normal give and take of the political process where this Court has no function.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.100" offset="6700304">And in White versus Regester... and again, Justice Stevens and the whole Court in the plurality opinion distinguisher white on what ground?</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.089" offset="6728307">The fact that there was no evidence in Mobile... rather, in distinguishing Mobile from White they say there's no evidence there of any real exclusion from the political process that is a result of any kind of discrimination, purposeful or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.897" offset="6775536">And the question here, I think, the first question is what is this kind of exclusion from the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.698" offset="6794762">Now, I think this case... the findings of this case in the trial court and the court of appeals show as strong an exclusion and omission from the political process of the black people in Burke County as you could possibly have in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.458" offset="6849829">The first thing that... and again, let me refer to Mobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.284" offset="8881110">Mr. Walbert, I'm puzzled by the district court's methodology here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.754" offset="8906919">On page 71a, the district courts makes the finding which you quote on the first page of your brief, I think, that moreover, it is evident that the present scheme of electing county commissioners, although racially neutral when adopted, is being maintained for invidious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.197" offset="8968777">Now, there are two findings on the question of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.899" offset="8979540">One, there was no intent when adopted but is presently being maintained with a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.786" offset="8999079">And I can understand a district court's summarizing the evidence which led it to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.107" offset="9024366">But if the district court's approach is consistent with Mobile, I'm at a loss to know why you went through all these so-called Zimmer factors later in the opinion, as if he still hadn't covered the ground.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_f_walbert" startTime="2268.165" stopTime="2398.048">
            <label>Mr. David F. Walbert</label>
            <text syncTime="2268.165" offset="9072640">I think there's two reasons for that, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.617" offset="9082462">I think the district court in a way... Zimmer was still the law, in a way, in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.251" offset="9100957">And as the Fifth Circuit clearly says, though, in this case, Judge Alaimo did something more than just a Zimmer analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.924" offset="9127602">And remember what the Zimmer analysis used to be before Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.276" offset="9137006">That was, you add up three categories and if you win on two or three, it's a legal presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.011" offset="9156023">It's sort of like... it's a game almost, in a sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.613" offset="9166367">Judge Alaimo did this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.398" offset="9177548">He categorized the evidence according to the Zimmer categories, and I think he was right in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.550" offset="9194162">But it does not create a legal problem like Mr. Leverett says because of this: all the evidence you could think of to prove intentional discrimination fits in one Zimmer category or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.575" offset="9238256">To say that you outline the evidence by the Zimmer categories almost says nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.795" offset="9255079">There's no defect in the district court's opinion because he organized it under the Zimmer categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.697" offset="9274723">For example, the very first one, the first Zimmer category, is access to the political system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.567" offset="9294263">Now, I can't think of any evidence of intentional discrimination in using the at-large system that really wouldn't fit under that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.505" offset="9321953">I think the question here is... and this has always been the problem with Zimmer because it's so, kind of an amorphous thing, but the question is what was the evidence and what were the findings underneath those Zimmer categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.296" offset="9365107">That's the key thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.879" offset="9367510">Not whether or not he outlined it according to Zimmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.248" offset="9376914">And again, let's look at Mobile because Mobile made a finding that there was no access to the political system in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.302" offset="9401156">That was based one thing, and that was racial block voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.771" offset="9411082">In this case, it was based on much more than that... registration discrimination, exclusion from the Democratic Party, which is vastly more exclusionary type of evidence than occurred in White versus Regester where it was just some kind of a private slating organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.263" offset="9468970">We had the freeholder requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.696" offset="9474717">There's always been a freeholder requirement to run for county commissioner, and that has a devastating impact on the ability of the black people to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.117" offset="9500421">So I think that, again, just the fact that Zimmer is used by the district court as a method of organizing the evidence does not tell us that there's something wrong as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.010" offset="9552039">And the court of appeals looked very closely and said that the district court did, in fact, make a separate and independent finding of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.830" offset="9575236">And I think this Court should, in some part, defer to that decision as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.048" offset="9592163">Mr. Walbert, I guess one of the important things we have to resolve in this case is whether the court of appeals appropriately articulated the standards under Mobile versus Bolden, and the court of appeals in its opinion placed great emphasis on the finding of unresponsiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.164" offset="9684637">Is that a requirement in your view of Mobile, or is that sufficient under Mobile, and would you address yourself to the court of appeals and whether it adhered to the Mobile standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.106" offset="9740330">I think Justice O'Connor has added in a new burden on the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.807" offset="9751197">It said it as a sine qua non of prevailing, you must prove it as an essential element of the case even if you proved intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.363" offset="9781394">So I think in that regard, it adds something in that Mobile never talked about or never suggested and we would say A, that's wrong, but B, it has nothing to do with this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.033" offset="9812114">Because all that could have done was hurt us; it could not have hurt the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.852" offset="9827370">The court does not give controlling weight to the question of responsiveness; only controlling against the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.858" offset="9859344">It does not say if you prove it, that's a strong inference or presumption of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.495" offset="9877943">It expressly says that in one of the footnotes, number of which I can't recall offhand, but it says that responsiveness is significant only in its absence because that's failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.036" offset="9924127">It does not accord undue significance at all to proof of responsiveness, in terms of inferring discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.463" offset="10093819">And you can look here and you can look there and you can make something out of this language or that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.915" offset="10107611">But fortunately, the Fifth Circuit has a little section in its opinion which says what is the rule established by Zimmer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.985" offset="10127882">And that is on page 39a of the Appendix of the Jurisdictional Statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.889" offset="10151497">And I think if this Court finds that that is inadequate, then I think Mr. Leverett's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.941" offset="10167693">I think the case should be reversed as to the finding of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.710" offset="10178769">But I think that decision of what the rule established is entirely correct and totally in accord of what the plurality... even the plurality opinion said in Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.583" offset="10214296">And that's this: First of all, the court says that according to the plurality... and again, the Mobile, the Fifth Circuit, rather, in this case tried to follow the Mobile plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.106" offset="10256405">It didn't try and go off in any other direction; it tried to follow the plurality opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.575" offset="10270198">It said discriminatory purpose is necessary in challenging the maintenance of an at-large election system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.062" offset="10296216">That's the first thing, and that's certainly consistent with the plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.181" offset="10304679">Secondly, it says that you may infer intent from the totality of the circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.418" offset="10325577">There now is no dispute over that, Mr. Leverett agrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.454" offset="10337802">The third thing it says is an essential element of the prima facie case is unresponsiveness and we just talked about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.036" offset="13024131">And frankly, I think this Court ought to decide this case based on Section 2 rather than getting into these constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.771" offset="13043043">Our position on Section 2 was addressed by the court in Mobile by, I think, five or six of the justices and there was no majority opinion under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.710" offset="13078779">The plurality said that it's the same thing as the Fifteenth Amendment, no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.081" offset="13096229">And in dissent, Justice Marshall and Justice Brennan said it is... it covers effect as well, and it covers these kind of practices, and Justice White and Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens took no position on Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.556" offset="13142204">So there's no opinion of this Court, and I think that this Court ought to seriously consider that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.607" offset="13158400">And our position is not, as Mr. Leverett says, that everything with any impact or effect on black voters is illegal under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.444" offset="13185776">Our position is simply that where you have a neutral device that perpetuates these clear consequences of past purposeful discrimination, then that is reached... those kind of effects and only those are reached by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.787" offset="13243141">I think that if we look at the plurality opinion we can see one problem with it right away, and that is that it holds that Section 2 applies only to outright and absolute denials of the right to vote only if you are not allowed into the voting booth, and that's a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.233" offset="13312836">Because the coverage provision of Section 2 is exactly like the coverage provision of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.402" offset="13337600">That is, the kind of practices that are covered has exactly the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.188" offset="13352751">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.206" offset="13356722">This Court held unanimously I think it was in Allen versus Board of Elections that that language covers at-large elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.960" offset="13387755">So the only question I think we really have to recognize that the plurality was in error was with regard to that construction, that aspect of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.902" offset="13427566">And it really should seriously... I think the Court should seriously consider that issue and dispose of this case on a Section 2 ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.460" offset="14089822">And I would further submit that the evidence in this case shows that notwithstanding the cries about we need these registration sites, the undisputed evidence is that in one of these registration places, only 50 or 60 voters had been registered by the time of the trial there, and another one less than 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.341" offset="14185326">Before I came up here this past week I checked on it and it's still less than 100 in each of the new registration sites, which indicates that they were not needed that much after all, anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.918" offset="14239660">Mr. Chief Justice, there are at least three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.137" offset="14256483">I'm not sure about the one in Goth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.253" offset="14264947">I asked Mr. Lewis and he is not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.455" offset="14277799">There would be three at least, one at Sardis, one at Midville and one at the county site in Waynesboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.561" offset="14314162">There may be one at Goth, I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.180" offset="14324715">It was originally established, the man had some problems, he didn't know how to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.400" offset="14345509">They finally had to pick up the cards and it was put somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.054" offset="14368183">Then the last statement was made that the... just look what happened when the court ordered relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.808" offset="14395141">Of course, two of the plaintiffs in this case ran in that election, and I'm sure that there was some encouraging of others to run to make a demonstration of response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.949">And of course, I might say that one of the plaintiffs ran after the plaintiff's plan had been approved, which deliberately gerrymandered the lines to put there of the incumbent commissioners in one district against Mr. Lodge, and they even tried to amend it to put a fourth one in, but the court did not go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.276">We submit that the judgment below should be reversed.</text>
