            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="139539">We will hear arguments next in Village of Hoffman Estates against Flipside, Hoffman Estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.872" offset="178932">Mr. Williams, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard N. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="12.474" offset="189381">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is limited to a question of vagueness of a drug paraphernalia ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.162" offset="232117">Vagueness, of course, has been defined by this Court under Grayned versus Rockford as an ordinance or statute that gives a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, and also that there are in fact standards for those who must enforce this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.624" offset="302021">The U. S. District Court found this ordinance constitutional in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.111" offset="323963">The challenge was not just to vagueness, but in fact as to First Amendment issues, as to overbreadth, and as to equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.051" offset="355728">The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reached only the vagueness issue, and said quite clearly that they did not reach the other issues, although I think it important to point out that in the brief of Flipside, they argue that First Amendment issues are present which would call for a stricter test.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.880" offset="439007">The Seventh Circuit did not reach that issue, did not apply those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.749" offset="454471">So, before the Court today in the briefs, First Amendment issues have been briefed even though we rely on a less rigorous standard, in that this is a civil licensing ordinance, and we believe one that does not invade constitutionally protected areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.461" offset="521345">Flipside argues that First Amendment issues are present, and therefore the stricter standards should follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.948" offset="547258">I can review that.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.681" offset="554259">What we have is presumptive validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.649" offset="562096">We do not have constitutionally protected issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.935" offset="575261">We do not have a criminal ordinance, and we are asking the Court review on a less stricter review on that basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard N. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="249.271" offset="1136581">When this ordinance was written, there were no court opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.842" offset="1150896">This was written in February of '78, at the direction of the village board to myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.627" offset="1166047">Since then, as you can see, there has been an explosion of litigation in both state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.281" offset="1192587">As draftsman of the ordinance, I had to meet many concerns, of course, not guided by the case law as we now know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.054" offset="1223725">The first consideration was to determine, should we criminalize or should we license because of the proliferation of what we believe was in the rational interest of roach clips, bong pipes, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.527" offset="1269596">It was recognized that most of these items are legal in and of themselves, that there is not, as Justice White states, obviously that they are illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.300" offset="1308675">There are some items, however, that are, so we have approached it two ways, those items that are designed for use with illegal drugs and those items that are marketed for use, and of course our emphasis would be on the marketing, because this is no different than milk, food, flowers, paint, clothing, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.179" offset="1380251">Every municipality licenses its retailers within the confines of its jurisdiction, and this is regulating at the commercial source.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.950" offset="1411284">So we chose not to definitely define each of these items.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.819" offset="1426749">If you have gone through what is known as the Model Act, and some of the state statutes that are in the cases cited, you will see they make an attempt to specifically identify this power hitter, this bong pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.758" offset="1470530">We saw the difficulty right away with trying to make these items per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.912" offset="1487144">We chose to regulate, therefore, at the retail sale, rather than put the onus on some innocent purchaser that may or may not know what he is purchasing, to put the burden back on the retailer, in essence, under the McGowan theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.589" offset="1549838">We do only penalize minors in the area where they would drink under age or buy tobacco under age by state statute and city ordinance, and both of these have criminal prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.860" offset="1594977">We chose to place no criminal prohibition even on a minor that bought from a retailer that was selling illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.066" offset="1623712">We believe this also addresses the question of transferred intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.268" offset="1640535">In the Record Revolution Number 6 versus Parma case, that was before this Court for review in June of this year, or May of this year, the Sixth Circuit rejected that Parma ordinance on two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.862" offset="1698945">One, that there was a transferred intent, that if the retailer, the manufacturer intended it for illegal use and the purchaser bought it innocently, they could go back and prove this intent, and here we would have a possible conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.002" offset="1747532">So they found a vagueness there.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.302" offset="1752652">Secondly, that ordinance said that you can't advertise these types of items, and that was just one small city in the state of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.791" offset="1790687">We chose not to touch the First Amendment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.743" offset="1802494">We have not raised questions of advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.429" offset="1813152">We were very careful and prudent to avoid First Amendment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.981" offset="1827363">Throughout the district court proceedings and Seventh Circuit proceedings, we have been attempted to be painted with a First Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.820" offset="1854739">It has always been our intent to avoid that, and I think successfully so.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.605" offset="1869890">We chose to avoid those issues even though I think under Virginia State Board of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Press, that if they did advertise these items, clearly this would not be protected speech, and we could proceed, and since then, I believe both the Eighth Circuit, Tenth Circuit, and a number of the other federal opinions have found that these are not first amendment issues when they are promoting the sale of these items for illegal purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.720" offset="2070406">They would argue that the fact that they merely displayed these items together is a form of free expression and free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.791" offset="2098618">I believe that in the retail setting, that if you... these things fall together.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.493" offset="2121501">If you find that our language,</text>
            <text syncTime="497.045" offset="2127666">"marketed for use with illegal drugs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="498.813" offset="2134772">is not vague, then even if their argument on display could be free expression, it falls because it is advocating use with illegal substances, and I believe in my reply brief I cited a number of these cases, I believe, Music Stop from California and Novai from Michigan, that have said display does not reach First Amendment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.109" offset="2215960">Also, the Supreme Court of Kansas in the Carterella case, looked at display and said, this is not First Amendment material, and other courts have just gone right over that issue and not even addressed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.249" offset="2264443">The Model Act that so many of these cases addressed was not written by the Drug Enforcement Agency of the Department of Justice until 18 months after we had drafted our ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.324" offset="2316793">So this is not to say today that we may prefer to take that particular action that in fact criminalizes this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.996" offset="2347513">In fact, it gives us a strong control over this proliferation in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.817" offset="2370710">But at that time we went with what we had, but I think their argument addresses very clearly the issue of intent in the words "designed for use".</text>
            <text syncTime="567.005" offset="2407490">They have traced the long history of it, in prohibition cases and other cases, and I think the same language that this Court applied in Parker v. Levy, the history of interpretation of the words can be applied to "designed for use".</text>
            <text syncTime="579.229" offset="2456391">In their brief, they point out the number... I think the Delaware opinion, and the Maryland district court opinion, both that adopt this word and found that intent or scienter is entered by this, and I think we can go back to the Boyce case as well, where this Court clearly said the word, the magic word "intent" need not be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.524" offset="4957563">In the cases that are cited to the Court and Drug Enforcement Agency testimony they estimate it is up to a $3 billion industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.261" offset="4988492">I have some questions about that large of an industry, but certainly it is something that is going on, and we believe that we have a rational interest to go after it, and we do ban it on minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.670" offset="5038125">That is another issue that has to be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.470" offset="5045335">We ban these types of items, even though they are legal, and we recognize they are legal for the most part, we ban their sale to minors in the same way we ban tobacco and cigarettes, and I think under the Ginsburg versus New York guidelines, that we can treat minors differently than adults, especially in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.286" offset="5132584">The guidelines raise another issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.905" offset="5147108">The Model Act guidelines I believe are good guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.107" offset="5163931">The Eighth Circuit thought they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.391" offset="5169051">The Tenth Circuit thought they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.641" offset="5174066">The Second Circuit recently thought they were, in Brockey, which is now at 558 Fed Second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.628" offset="5197995">We find that the guidelines we issued, very short, very temporary, nonetheless gave an enforcement officer and the retailer an idea of what we were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.686" offset="5246269">They addressed themselves primarily to display.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.888" offset="5255046">We found things as roach clips were per se, we conceded that those were designed for legal uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.744" offset="5286497">Now, alligator clips and other things can be adapted, but what we were saying was, the way you display it is what we are going to look at, and again they tried to paint us with a First Amendment, because if they have A Child's Garden of Cocaine, or some other type of book, or a cocaine mirror, they suddenly say that is First Amendment expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.337" offset="5352848">I again go back to Virginia Board of Pharmacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.253" offset="5364551">I again go back to Pittsburg Press to say, we can limit that expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.157" offset="5380120">But more than that, in the district court we flatly denied it was a First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.859" offset="5394958">They agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.009" offset="5399555">The Seventh Circuit did not reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.911" offset="5407183">The other courts have said that type of thing does not reach First Amendment proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.465" offset="5429335">But I think that has to be looked at and addressed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.334" offset="5440829">One other point that we make that the district court found was proper and the Seventh Circuit had some concern with was our Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.309" offset="5484715">I wrote an Administrative Procedure Act a year before based upon the Administrative Procedure Acts that states use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.378" offset="5513031">And if you are selling milk or selling food, we have hearings, we have guidelines, we tell you how hot the water has to be to wash the dishes and so on, all the nitty-gritty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.334" offset="5552842">We do the same thing with everything we license, just like the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.138" offset="5567993">And we were preparing to go to those procedure hearings at the time this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.208" offset="5592339">But on file were the temporary guidelines, so we think that we did meet the guideline requirement of Grayned in an adequate manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.994" offset="6019493">We put that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.994" offset="6023464">The register, we knew controlled 5 substances could require a register, we put that in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2875.016" offset="11639581">Screws was one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.199" offset="11644283">Boyce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.816" offset="11646791">The acts that you describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.800" offset="11650657">But in no instance, and here is where I find unique dynamics in the law have taken place, because in those instances, for example, in burglary tools if I may use that also, sir, what hardware store could have filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory judgment of invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.244" offset="11712515">He would have no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.327" offset="11716799">The difference here is that although they argued that there is no bootstrapping of intent, there is an imminent, clear, immediate threat of enforcement, because they think they know what drug paraphernalia is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.070" offset="11775732">They have told us, and threatened us with enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.356" offset="11784927">Not others selling the same merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.658" offset="11794122">In those cases, I can't imagine a company that could have sought a declaratory judgment contemplating a merger, and so they seek a declaratory judgment holding invalid because it would be violative of their right to me the contemplated merger, in the same way that the hardware store could not bring a suit, because it had no immediate threat of harm, no enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.673" offset="11886177">It would be, if you will no case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.625" offset="11897985">But this is quite difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.258" offset="11904568">And it was in all the cases, in Parma, in Ferndale, in Egan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.029" offset="11923585">In each case, the village has said, this law applies to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.266" offset="11944587">We are going to arrest you if you do not come into compliance, and we took our chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.801" offset="11962664">We removed all items in the department or, as we were told, have the... sign the police register for everything, to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.471" offset="11989413">That is the type of clarity we were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.656" offset="11998086">That is the type of standards for compliance and adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.358" offset="12008953">Have them do it for everything, just to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.310" offset="12016685">So we clearly had standing, because the threat was going to be applied, and it is because of that that we now have the right to challenge the vagueness, because we have such an imminent, real threat of enforcement that we may challenge it based upon our position, pre-enforcement, whereas in almost all of those situations, I cannot conceive of one where he could have challenged it pre-enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.176" offset="12112189">I cannot consider, for example, Screws filing a pre-enforcement act to find that... violating somebody's constitutional rights would be an offense prior to the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.948" offset="12155239">I am contemplating killing this guy, but I want to know first if that is a violation of his federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.435" offset="12173211">There is no real or imminent threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.702" offset="12178331">He would not have had standing to bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.221" offset="12184391">The court would not have had a case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.589" offset="12193795">Boyce, could Boyce have said, well, I want to go through Holland Tunnel, maybe I will explode, maybe I won't but I want to know if the law, talking about practicable, and dangerous intersections, is sufficiently clear so that I do it without risk?</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.933" offset="12255235">He didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.166" offset="12260146">Instead, he drove the tunnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.385" offset="12265057">The third time his truck exploded and 60 people were injured.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.458" offset="12317302">I think that this Court was very clear, and I believe stressed heavily the fact that Boyce, the statute in Boyce was the result of heavy industry participation, and several times in the opening notes, statement of the case, and in its conclusion, the Court reiterated again and again the important role that truck regulations, and that those affected by the statute had in participating in drafting the subject statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.549" offset="12457632">Instead, they chose to violate the law, and so they violated it at their own risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.250" offset="12472470">We had standing and yet chose not to violate the law in order to litigate our federal claims, and so certainly if Boyce had had standing, then it would have been a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.077" offset="12523774">McGowan, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.177" offset="12528163">McGowan didn't have to stand in violation of the law and sell items in the department store without going to the beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.081" offset="12551777">If he had had standing, if there was an imminent threat of enforcement, and he had otherwise complied, then he perhaps could have filed in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.103" offset="12587931">Perhaps it would have been a situation where he would have had to litigate his federal claims in state court, because there was no imminent threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.674" offset="12618233">However, instead he chose to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.893" offset="12631085">They sold stuff on Sunday, didn't bother to litigate their federal claims, and didn't bother to go to the beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.962" offset="12655327">And certainly somebody maybe shouldn't be responsible, or maybe it's not constitutional to make everybody go to the beach every Sunday to find out what by virtue of popular demand is being sold, but he at least should have done it or sue, but not just flagrantly violate the law and say, well, gee, that is vague, I didn't know I was supposed to go down to the beach, when the statute set it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.291" offset="12744666">In the other cases, for example, in the one case mentioned for display, Danovitz, in the appellate decision it was clear that as a part of the array, and this is the only case I am aware of where a marketing case was found a a part of the array, was alcohol, and it is a bootleg case, and so when you talk about the bottles and corks that were present in the Danovitz case, T think it is essential when you read the Feitler... Feitler died before its determination so it changed to Danovitz in the Supreme Court; it was Feitler and Danovitz in the appellate court... they talked about the fact that alcohol was a part of array.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.083" offset="12907774">So you have the nexus that we talked about in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.200" offset="12920313">This, these laws, all the laws dealing with drug paraphernalia, as they attempt to define it, are, if you will, prospective attempts to reach derivative contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.591" offset="12973812">It is anticipatory in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.810" offset="12982693">On the one hand they argue that there is no such thing as drug paraphernalia per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.012" offset="12999516">And so intent is necessary to clear vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.816" offset="13014772">On the other hand, they say, there is a $3 billion business in drug paraphernalia, and it is specific things, and these things are drug paraphernalia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.837" offset="14122886">He said, well, you license all milk, but you don't license all corncob pipes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.123" offset="14140022">We didn't say we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.141" offset="14144097">We license only corncob pipes marketed for use with illegal drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.677" offset="14162174">And again, we go back to display.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.879" offset="14170951">The Chief Justice asked about hypodermic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.331" offset="14180773">Many of the older statutes have this in them from the... that go quite a ways back before we got into head shops, and I would like to leave a citation with the Court in the District of Columbia hypodermic issue, where they did infer intent in that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.940" offset="14247229">It was 313 Atlantic Second, 876, Rosser v. U. S., and Justice White was concerned with bong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.446" offset="14277322">Well, the court reporter was as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.314" offset="14284741">The court reporter didn't know what a bong was, and on Page 52 of the joint appendix, the testimony of our police officer to show the presumption that what they sell is being used for illegal drugs,</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.837" offset="14326850">"Officer, have you come in contact with what is known as a bong pipe? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.872" offset="14338971">it is printed as "bomb".</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.691" offset="14354226">"Yes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.008" offset="14347539">"Have you seen persons in the community using the item? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.091" offset="14355898">"Do you recall what was used? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.726" offset="14362377">"Yes, generally cannibis. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.810" offset="14366765">and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.376" offset="14368959">So, I think that is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.912" offset="14379095">One other issue on these mirrors, with the cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.482" offset="14397381">I would like to take... there is nothing wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.351" offset="14408875">That is not paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.368" offset="14412950">Judge Layton said it was, but we didn't argue it was, because when you put that up with the things you sell, it adds to the display and your intent of what you are doing it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.873" offset="14450984">I think in direct sales if the manufacturer or the doctor that was buying these loads of narcotics would have that sign up in his office or his store, the circumstantial evidence and presumption of what they were doing would have been much clearer and much stronger to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.566" offset="14509707">The last comment I wish to make is from Casbah v. Thone, the Eighth Circuit opinion, and it is at 651 Fed Second at 551, where they said the dealer, on the other hand, who sells innocuous items when the intent they be used with drugs is in effect put on notice by the illicit nature of his activity that he must be careful to conform his conduct to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.748" offset="14598523">Even the illicit dealer is not held legally responsible, as plaintiffs would suggest, for guessing what is in the mind of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.252" offset="14628512">We are going right at the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.354" offset="14636871">And this is the opinion that seems to now be adopted by the federal courts' reviewing and the circuits such as the Eighth and the Tenth in these particular areas.</text>
