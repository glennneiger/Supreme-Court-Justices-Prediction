            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="124215">We will hear arguments first this morning in Brown against Hartlage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.987" offset="148143">Mr. Goldberg, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred M. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.106" offset="164548">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.224" offset="177087">This matter is before the Court this morning on a writ of certiorari of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.378" offset="201642">The issues raised involve issues of First Amendment rights of political speech, and specifically whether this speech has been infracted by Kentucky Revised Statute, which I may refer to as KRS, 121055.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.589" offset="278546">The Court will find that in the statutory appendix to the brief on the merits at page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.778" offset="307281">That statute has been interpreted, in our opinion, in such manner as to encroach upon the Petitioner's rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.717" offset="343017">The specific issues before the Court this morning will be vagueness and overbreadth, will be the creation of artificial distinctions based on content or speaker, and the threshold issue of clear and present danger and whether that doctrine was applied by the courts of Kentucky appropriately in this case or at all indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.498" offset="438207">As applied in the facts at bar, this case or this statute would prohibit a candidate from promising in an election campaign the pro tanto reduction of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.008" offset="500169">Generally speaking, the proceedings below were that the trial court found that the statute had been violated, but on interesting findings which I will discuss with the Court in a minute found that the election should not be voided.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.387" offset="569759">To the contrary, he found that the Petitioner here was fairly elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.707" offset="594942">The matter was appealed to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, and it found a violation of the statute as interpreted and found that the statute should be strictly applied and the election voided.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.265" offset="645201">On a petition for rehearing to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky... and the Court of Appeals of Kentucky is now our intermediate appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.036" offset="684280">At some points the cases will have come from the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, and at another point the case will come from the Supreme Court of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.011" offset="728166">I'll attempt to distinguish the two as we move through.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.896" offset="743735">The Court of Appeals on its petition for rehearing then reconsidered, found that the statute was still violated, but on the other hand expressed some reservation in regard to the constitutionality and the overbreadth of the statute, and nonetheless overruled the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.030" offset="844254">A petition was then filed or motion for discretionary review to the Supreme Court of Kentucky, our now highest appellate court, and that was summarily overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.088" offset="892528">This Court granted certiorari and we're here on the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.742" offset="915098">Carl Brown, the Petitioner in this matter, sought the office of county commissioner of Jefferson County, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.979" offset="948117">Jefferson County, Kentucky contains the only city of the first class in Kentucky, and in that regard in the Joint Appendix you will find some statutes that refers to city of the first class.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.053" offset="1004333">That is only in Jefferson County, Kentucky, if the Court will.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.273" offset="1021260">But in any event, Carl Brown sought a seat on the Fiscal Court, which is our legislative body which along with the county judge executive forms the executive branch of government of the county, although it has legislative functions as well, pass ordinances, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.270" offset="1109240">This was in the election of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.139" offset="1124705">Brown and a Dr. Bill Creech were running mates on a joint platform as the Republican candidates and ran against the Respondent, Earl Hartlage, as the Democratic incumbent.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.767" offset="1187190">Now, the Petitioner and Creech campaigned on issues of governmental economy and the usual issues that one would expect of an election of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.741" offset="1235151">Specifically, they zeroed in on some of Hartlage's spending and primarily in at least one press release that is available to you-all commented very unfavorably in regard to the salary which Mr. Hartlage had voted himself since he had been in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.024" offset="1328251">In all events the election heated, and by August 15th, 1979 Creech and Brown issued a joint press release.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.379" offset="1369629">That may be found at the Joint Appendix, page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.748" offset="1383108">And in that statement they attacked the frivolity of spending of Hartlage and almost in a manner as I perceive the statement and as it appears, almost in a manner of put up or shut up vein said to prove the strength of our convictions, we will reduce our salaries by the sum of $3,000 a year each.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.066" offset="1484463">The statement was made, and within the next day or two a friend of Brown's contacted him and advised him that it may be arguable whether there was some problem legally with that statement or with that comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.627" offset="1558651">Brown's a young lawyer, and he went to his office and indeed did some research and found that certainly someone had articulated an arguable question under the law of Kentucky, that there were some Kentucky cases that may look like they make that an illegal promise, that it is inconceivable that his election could have been voided.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.393" offset="1653737">In all events on Monday, I believe, but the 19th day of August 1979, four days after the comment was made, Brown and Creech in a joint press conference, which received the same publicity and the same coverage as the original statement, retracted that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.174" offset="1744852">They acknowledged that the statement was perhaps arguably in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.328" offset="1769511">They retracted the promise, said that they would not abide by the concept of that reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.934" offset="1803888">Now, the election was held on November the 6th, 1979, 78 days after the retraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.955" offset="1839937">There had been no retreat from the retraction from the time it was made until the time of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.061" offset="1876404">The results of the election, of the 177,501 ballots cast, Brown received approximately 53 percent of the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.001" offset="1920186">He beat Hartlage by 10,151 ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.988" offset="1944114">And Dr. Creech was defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.273" offset="1957279">He was not elected, though having made the same commitment as Brown had made or the same promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.927" offset="1987895">Seasonably, an election contest was filed in early December of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.746" offset="2019137">An answer was appropriately filed and issues joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.864" offset="2035647">In that answer the fifth affirmative defense raises the constitutional issues before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.534" offset="2070337">They have consistently been argued and raised from the trial court through the Court of Appeals to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.790" offset="2103356">Pardon me, please.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.825" offset="2107431">The matter was tried in a bench trial on January 29th and 30th, 1980, and the evidence, among the rest of the evidence appears a stipulation by the Petitioner and by the Respondent that the retraction received as broad a coverage publicity-wise as the original statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.095" offset="2232506">The trial court then rendered its decision and found that there was a technical, if you will... and that's my own characterization... a technical violation of KRS 121055, the statute which prohibited the promise to the electorate, but that the election was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.543" offset="2322367">And the trial judge found as a fact in his determination of the fairness of the election, he found five elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.399" offset="2357789">He found that there was an almost immediate retraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.951" offset="2375970">He found that there was no retreat from the retraction from the day it was made to the day of the election, and commented even though Mr. Brown had been challenged by Mr. Hartlage at some political conclave, Brown remained adamant in his retraction and did not deviate from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.483" offset="2466145">The judge balanced the disenfranchisement of thousands of voters, as he put it, and the presumption of the will of the people and Creech's defeat, and found that the election was fair and that Brown should receive his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.063" offset="2548378">Now, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in its original opinion rendered August the 8th, 1980 followed an old decision in Kentucky that harks back to 1960, Sparks against Boggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.005" offset="2616192">And it may be appropriate for me to digress for a moment and advise the Court as to the ramifications of Sparks against Boggs and a prior opinion that harks to 1925, Owsley against Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.450" offset="2689962">These two cases, in my judgment, are probably interpretive of some phases of the statute and require some comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.842" offset="2735519">In the Owsley matter the county attorney offered to serve for a salary of $400 less than the previous attorney had received.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.803" offset="2799363">His salary had not been sent by the county commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.755" offset="2815141">His election was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.457" offset="2826008">He won, and his election was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.992" offset="2840114">In any event, upon challenge the then Court of Appeals of Kentucky... and it was our highest court in 1925... held that the reduction of salary was a legal possibility in the context of the fact that it had not been set, and also said in its opinion that a promise that is made to the entire electorate is not a bribe and not to be conceived as a bribe, but it differentiated that from a promise made to a smaller group of the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.652" offset="2998729">In that case then it was held that the county attorney would be seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.222" offset="3033002">In 1960 in the matter of Sparks against Boggs, which itself was the election of a group of city commissioners of the city of Hazard, Kentucky who ran as platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.613" offset="3086605">The salary in that instance had been previously set by statute at $500 each per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.468" offset="3122027">The commissioners promised as a plank of their platform that they would forego all but a dollar of that sum and contribute it to various charitable, some civic, Little League, and organizations of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.263" offset="3197260">It was not a commitment to the entire electorate but to a select group in the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.267" offset="3221188">The Court of Appeals of Kentucky in that case distinguished Owsley... again, that was our highest court at the time... distinguished Owsley and in effect said that the promise to serve for less was a bribe and as such should be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.949" offset="3311990">Now, in that light we find that the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in the Carl Brown case, the case before you this morning, in the Carl Brown case held that Brown could not legally do the act, he could not legally reduce his salary; and in that regard there was no exception in the statute for a retraction; in that regard that the other considerations of the trial court were inapplicable and not to be considered; and that the statement was not constitutionally protected under the aegis of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.995" offset="3492130">Now, on the--</text>

            <text syncTime="934.723" offset="3863069">Now, on the petition for rehearing rendered on October 29th, 1980, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky perceived that the Petitioner's position was not without logic or appeal, but suggested that if you want the relief that you request of us, we perceive your argument to be that one of overbreadth on a federal constitutional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.613" offset="4002667">But if you want that relief, go to the Court of Appeals... Supreme Court of Kentucky and they are the court that can grant you the relief that you seek.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.040" offset="4072362">Now, on that state of facts obviously we petitioned the Supreme Court of Kentucky, and we were summarily turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.098" offset="4124607">This Court has granted us the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.799" offset="4139340">Now, at the outset of argument I would suggest to the Court that I concede that the Commonwealth of Kentucky has an interest in the electoral process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.463" offset="4218021">However, I argue and urge that that is not an uninhibited interest, that is not uninhibited as to political speech particularly, but that that interest must be balanced against the intrusions on the First Amendment right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.825" offset="4399415">Mr. Goldberg, do you think that under Kentucky law a campaign promise to try to cut government expenditures and reduce taxes would be legal or illegal?</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.935" offset="4463885">I'm inclined that the promise to cut taxes would be illegal, and that's part of the vagueness argument, Justice O'Connor; and it runs something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.392" offset="4509756">If we posit that the Owsley and Sparks decision prohibit the making of a promise that would to the benefit of all the public and it is incapable of being legally performed, I'd suggest to you that a candidate any office... in the Senate, in the legislature, or in executive branch of government... couldn't make that promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.363" offset="4637652">The vagueness is inherent in the that no single member of any body of government without the cooperation of a majority of his house or a majority of his group and without the imprimatur of the chief executive can ever make such a promise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.288" offset="5637306">It's evident in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.522" offset="5642217">But I am suggesting to you that he had to go research, as a young lawyer, he had to go research that problem out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.061" offset="5672414">And it is not without debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.678" offset="5678893">Your amicus curiae and I both have argued both sides of the issue in this matter; and it occurs to me that the argument itself, Mr. Justice Rehnquist is dispositive of the vagueness of this statute; that there is no clear line of political speech that Carl Brown could have relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.711" offset="5775023">In that regard then with the no notice concept in this statute, we have to look at another concept that these facts give rise to and which have been briefed; and that is that in Kentucky a county commissioner in a county containing a city of the first class has a benchmark salary and he has an escalated salary by what we Kentuckians call the rubber dollar concept to make up for the inflationary action on all salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.174" offset="5960911">The base salary for a county commissioner in a county containing a city of the first class is found in KRS 6530 sub 6, and that appears in the Appendix to the brief, and it sets that benchmark salary at $9,600.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.725" offset="6059026">That is the legal salary, I don't know, except that I do know that it is permissible in Kentucky, the Fiscal Court may... it's written in the permissive... may escalate those salaries up to an administrative sum determined by the State Finance Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.090" offset="6160486">Now, we get to the very interesting question in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.625" offset="6174697">Carl Brown offered to serve at the time for what amounts to $17,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.629" offset="6206671">The rubber dollar concept had been applied to his situation or to the office which he sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.218" offset="6237077">He in effect said I will serve for $17,000, not the $20,000 that Mr. Hartlage is getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.240" offset="6269155">Does that create a legal impediment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.108" offset="6284620">The legal salary, if we are going to saddle Brown with determining that which is legal, then the legal salary would have to be brought down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.332" offset="6337492">The question would then arise does Brown have a right to give up that which is not part of the legal salary, the $9,600, or does he have a right to give up his rubber dollar theory or his rubber dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.794" offset="6407291">And there is a prohibition in the rubber dollar statute that reads to the effect that you shall not change your salary or you shouldn't change your salary during the term in which you're elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.403" offset="6469776">Now, in that regard then I would suggest also that a threshold question to the restraint on advocacy has to have been announced by this Court long ago, and in Landmark Communications against Virginia we find the clear and present danger test used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.452" offset="6569982">In this instance and in the matter at hand, Brown retracted 78 days prior to the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.159" offset="6616793">He never retreated from that retraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.361" offset="6629645">His running mate who made the same comment and the same promise to the electorate was defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.383" offset="6665694">Brown won by a resounding number of votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.669" offset="6686801">And in this regard I submit to this Court that there cannot possibly have been any threat to the compelling interest of the Commonwealth in regard to the Brown statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.851" offset="7195562">Courts have historically restrained themselves from involvement unless there is clear, convincing, glaring and measurable irregularity which cries out for judicial intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.576" offset="7238507">The sanctity of the freedom of voters choosing their new leaders or retaining incumbents is indelibly etched in the history of our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.729" offset="7271108">One of the attractions of our system of government is the assurance of meaningful, participatory and effective suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.418" offset="7301828">But Congress and state legislatures have set minimum standards for participating both as candidates and as voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.274" offset="7333279">Education, experience, or social standing are not legitimate criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.059" offset="7352401">With some obvious exceptions such as years of admission to the bar before seeking a judgeship, legislative bodies and constitutions have required no greater qualification for those who seek election than for those who vote for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.236" offset="7409139">Normally a length of residency requirement for state candidates but not even this for federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.020" offset="7432231">Age is usually a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.955" offset="7439964">So who may seek office and who may hold office is proscribed and encumbered minimally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.626" offset="7462638">As sure as restraint has been shown, response has been the key when the process has been corrupted or to avoid the appearance of corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.732" offset="7499105">It took a lot of years and effort to remove the government itself as a corrupting factor when citizens otherwise qualified were excluded strictly because of race from the electoral process by outright abuse and government legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.159" offset="7556783">This Court through its intercession and interpretation removed this cancer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.645" offset="7574755">This Court has repeatedly said that the minimal requirements are the only ones, and artificial, unreasonable, unscrupulous or unconscionable barriers will not be tolerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.418" offset="7617805">The Court has promptly responded to criminal acts which corrupt the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.422" offset="7637867">Bribing voters always, both state and federal, has been forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.440" offset="7653959">As an aside, just as paying for votes is prescribed, likewise paying to vote by the means of a poll tax has been extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.380" offset="7689694">It would trifle with this Court to review further the strong interest, both legislatively and judicially, which has been shown to forbid outright, overt, and damnably cruel acts to tamper with the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.639" offset="7746746">Another area, and difficult to administer, has been the regulating of acts which are neither constitutionally repulsive nor criminally measurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.113" offset="7788646">It is with such an act the case at bar is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.315" offset="7801394">The purity, honesty and fairness of the electoral process are compelling state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.719" offset="7826994">It is not difficult to recognize and punish bribery, but criminal acts such as bribery are not the only method of corrupting the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.075" offset="7860431">It is easy and required to define a criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.044" offset="7876313">It is, however, not so easy to define non-criminal corrupting acts if their existence is known and the putrefaction is recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.966" offset="7916019">In an attempt to keep pure the electoral process in Kentucky the constitution in 1895 set certain standards... this is in the constitution... set certain standards to be addressed by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.309" offset="7965443">The statutes as enacted, interpreted and applied apply even-handed regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.527" offset="13054305">On this same statute, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.679" offset="13058902">The candidates from up in northern Kentucky who said they'd pool the salary and hire a city manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.702" offset="13090981">They said you can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.335" offset="13097459">There's no provision in the law for a city manager, and besides that, you can't pull your salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.523" offset="13114282">That was up in northern Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.689" offset="13118879">Over in eastern Kentucky the tax assessor said... he'd been tax assessor before and said when I was tax assessor before you didn't pay taxes on certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.045" offset="13156391">Remember that when you vote for me this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.664" offset="13162870">The Court of Appeals of Kentucky at that time said no, you can only exempt from taxation matters which the Constitution allows you to exempt, and it's impossible for you to do this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.196" offset="13260986">It's the impossibility, though, that makes it an interest, a compelling state interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.241" offset="13345100">Hopeful--</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.264" offset="13373208">But I think this matter can be corrected, if it deserves correction, by the legislature of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.786" offset="13419288">The whole problem with this case was that defenses available in one statute were not available in this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.774" offset="13443216">It might have been better often if Congress or state legislatures had done things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.045" offset="13468293">In this case it didn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.081" offset="13480519">This is a legitimate state interest to protect this compelling interest in which the Commonwealth of Ketucky has an important and measurable interest, and it can be and should be, if necessary, corrected by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.459" offset="13553975">I would be the last to limit anyone's First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.078" offset="13572470">I do not think this statute as applied and narrowed by the courts of Kentucky puts any chill or any untold or untoward effect on any candidate in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.372" offset="13633701">It's seldom you can deal with a statute that says you can do everything but one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.991" offset="13652091">That's basically what these cases have said, that nothing is proscribed except that which is illegal and constitutionally impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.382" offset="13701724">I think that it is and would urge the Court, as the lower courts have, that this is a valid assertion by the state legislature of the interest of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and its electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.046" offset="13776329">This was not a statute which was hastily contrived to defeat some purpose that the legislature found distasteful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.699" offset="13806945">The legislature passed this act almost word for word because the constitution commanded it to do it; and it is with that compelling purpose, that weighty, important reason, that the Kentucky court should be sustained.</text>
