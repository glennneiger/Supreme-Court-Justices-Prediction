            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="10.729" offset="120306">This case is here on direct appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.011" offset="149458">The Village of Hoffman Estates enacted an ordinance regulating the sale of drug paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.278" offset="182477">The ordinance requires a business to obtain a license if the business sells any items that are "designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs."</text>
            <text syncTime="42.599" offset="247783">The Flipside, a record store that also sells novelty devices challenged the ordinance prior its enforcement arguing that the law is facially overbroad and vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.819" offset="316642">The Court of Appeals held that the law is unconstitutionally vague on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.672" offset="340152">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we conclude that the law is neither facially overbroad nor vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.545" offset="383620">The law does not significantly infringe the First Amendment Rights of Flipside or of other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.753" offset="416430">The law is also not facially vague since it clearly applies to some of Flipside's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.990" offset="453419">Flipside unquestionably sold roach clips and pipes that are specially designed for marijuana use.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.257" offset="490409">Flipside did sell some items that are designed for use with illegal drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.185" offset="514128">Furthermore, Flipside intentionally displayed these items and either drug-related items together in its store.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.820" offset="552685">Thus, it clearly has “marketed” some issues for use with illegal drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.983" offset="585390">Although the law is not vague on its face, we do not suggest that the risk of discriminatory enforcement is insignificant, but the Village may take steps to minimize that risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.645" offset="656025">But in this pre-enforcement challenge, the rise -- risk is too speculative toward in validating the law on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.092" offset="701792">Where the drug paraphernalia laws are wise or effective, it is not of course the problems of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.397" offset="735019">We only hold that such legislation is constitutional if it does not reach constitute and protected conduct if it is reasonably clear as applied to the complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.013" offset="789458">The decision of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.134" offset="821955">Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
