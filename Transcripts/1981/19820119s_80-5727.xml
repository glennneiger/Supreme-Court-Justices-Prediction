            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.178" offset="114116">This is a capital case here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals -- Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.926" offset="149120">When Eddings was 16 years old, he shot and killed a state highway patrol officer at the time Eddings, with three younger juveniles, was running away from their Missouri homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.478" offset="211291">He had a history of emotional problems, had been raised in a difficult family situation, and there was testimony that his mental and emotional development were at a level several years below his chronological age.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.064" offset="281613">The Oklahoma capital punishment statute provides in the sentencing proceeding that evidence may be presented as to mitigating and aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.376" offset="334903">Eddings' age was considered as a mitigating circumstance but this was viewed as outweighed by aggravating circumstances primarily the deliberate shooting of a state officer without provocation other than the fact that Eddings have been stopped on a state highway for erratic driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.010" offset="437407">Although the trial court admitted evidence as to Eddings' family history and emotional instability, it declined to consider these as mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.285" offset="494563">The Court of Criminal Appeals agreed and a sentence of death was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.085" offset="517760">In Lockett against Ohio, we held that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require in a capital case that the sentencing authority not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.537" offset="599576">We think the Oklahoma Court's committed error in failing to consider Eddings' background in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.196" offset="638132">We therefore reverse the judgment insofar as it imposed the death penalty and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.047" offset="677525">This Court is not unaware of the extent of which minors engage increasingly in violent crime nor do we suggest an absence of legal responsibility where crime is committed by a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.788" offset="740532">We are concerned in this case only with the validity of the procedure by which the death sentence was imposed on an emotionally disturbed 16-year-old.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.721" offset="792255">Justices Brennan and O'Connor have filed concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.728" offset="812317">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices White, Blackmun, and Rehnquist have joined.</text>
