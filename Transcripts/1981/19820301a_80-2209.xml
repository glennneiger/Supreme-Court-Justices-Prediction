            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We will hear arguments first today in the case of the United States against Ross.</text>

            <text syncTime="11.324" offset="45244">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which reversed Respondent's conviction on the ground that certain evidence should have been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.471" offset="133851">The evidence was heroin found in a paper bag seized on probable cause from the trunk of Respondent's automobile and searched without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.029" offset="180036">So the issue in this case is whether police officers who possess probable cause to search a paper bag found during the lawful search of an automobile must procure a search warrant before examining the contents of that bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.602" offset="246387">I think this divides itself into two sub-issues, first, in general, whether a paper bag is a container of the kind to which the warrant requirement applies, and secondly, assuming that it is outside an automobile, whether the requirement applies when it is discovered in the course of a probable cause search of an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.810" offset="339174">I don't usually employ visual aids in my arguments before this Court, but I think in this case it is important not to stick solely to abstractions, so I do have a paper bag which resembles, although it is not the actual bag that was involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.848" offset="419318">Now, what this case is about is whether the Fourth Amendment requires officers who needed no warrant to arrest Respondent, no warrant to carefully examine the passenger compartment and glove compartment of his car, and to unlock and search its trunk, to stop their search upon coming across a paper bag like this, which they have probable cause to believe contains heroin, to carry the bag carefully to the courthouse, to spend several hours preparing and presenting a warrant application to a magistrate before they may open the top of the bag and look inside.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.425" offset="589636">Well, I am sure that I would contend for the same result, for a number of reasons which I will get to, but it is potentially a relevant consideration, because the steps that may have been taken to preserve an interest of privacy have some bearing, in my view, on the application of the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.228" offset="676885">I think stapling a paper bag together would clearly be insufficient to activate the requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.626" offset="758491">--Well, that is... that is our position, but in order for us to prevail in this case, it is not necessary for the Court to decide the exceptional case in which a paper bag were stapled, taped, marked</text>
            <text syncTime="203.543" offset="814080">"Private contents, do not open. "</text>
            <text syncTime="205.855" offset="823380">and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.292" offset="825156">We would still argue that the paper bag is such an unsuitable container to maintain substantial privacy interests that the costs of the warrant requirement are not justified, but that would present an exceptional case, and I think that what is before the Court today must be judged in terms of the general class of cases involving searches of containers that ordinarily are not used as a repository for highly private or personal effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.311" offset="941244">Now, I wanted to make a couple of preliminary observations, and the first is that search and seizure issues generally have two facets.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.042" offset="976144">The first is the substantive inquiry into the amount and quality of the justification the police must possess before they may conduct a search, and the second is the procedural inquiry into whether a warrant should be required as a precondition to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.552" offset="1038106">Now, without denigrating the importance of the warrant in appropriate cases, I submit that the substantive requirement in cases like this, probable cause, is the far more important protection in safeguarding basic Fourth Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.920" offset="1099651">In this case, it is conceded that the substantive requirements were satisfied by the existence of probable cause, so the only question is whether the additional procedural prophylaxis of the warrant requirement is appropriate in this context.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.814" offset="1219187">You might have probable cause to search the car for the waffle iron, but if you got to the paper bag, you wouldn't be searching it, would you?</text>

            <text syncTime="316.309" offset="1265162">--I want to make a point completely clear in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.793" offset="1271118">We are not saying that a paper bag, as modest as it is, has no privacy interests, or that police can look in paper bags any time they feel like it, randomly, or without justification.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="330.663" stopTime="333.382">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="330.663" offset="1322632">--But you have to have probable cause to look for what can go in a paper bag.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="333.382" stopTime="530.348">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="333.382" offset="1333499">The scope of your search is determined by what you are looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.614" offset="1346456">In this case it was reasonable to look for heroin in a paper bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.347" offset="1361293">Now, the second preliminary point I wanted to make is that the question here is not whether the lawfulness of the search will be subject to judicial review, but simply the timing of that review.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.982" offset="1407896">That is, will it occur by a magistrate before the search or will it occur in some other forum after the search, a suppression hearing or a Bivens action.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.181" offset="1452722">Also, without wanting to belabor the point, I do want to remind the Court that it is really beyond serious dispute that neither the language nor the history of the Fourth Amendment directly supports the imposition of a warrant requirement in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.081" offset="1516251">The warrant requirement is rather a judicially created one designed to implement the reasonableness requirement of the first clause of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.046" offset="1552091">I say this not as a criticism of the judicial imposition of a warrant requirement, because I believe that the Court has correctly perceived that it is ordinarily unreasonable to permit certain kinds of searches to proceed solely on the basis of the judgment of a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.306" offset="1617189">What I hope to persuade the Court today is that any inquiry into the wisdom of ruling certain classes of searches unreasonable per se in the absence of a warrant depends on a consideration of the extent to which the warrant requirement serves the basic purposes of the Fourth Amendment in the particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.501" offset="1697959">This requires weighing the benefits that may be derived from the warrant requirement against the costs that are associated with the procedure, and the analysis that we espouse for assessing the value of the warrant procedure is precisely that employed by the Court for determining the procedures required to satisfy due process in procedural due process cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.194" offset="1784686">I would like to quote briefly from the opinion of Mathews against Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.443" offset="1801718">It is at Page 20 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.567" offset="1810181">The Court said that you should consider,</text>
            <text syncTime="455.019" offset="1820003">"First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal or administrative burden that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail. "</text>
            <text syncTime="479.040" offset="1916134">So, let me turn first to a consideration of the benefits that might be realized from the warrant procedure as applied to containers such as Respondent's paper bag or Mr. Robbins' plastic wrapped parcel.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.910" offset="1971618">Now, the decisions of this Court have essentially identified three types of benefits associated with the warrant procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.968" offset="2007771">One important benefit in some contexts is that the warrant limits the scope of the search by particularizing the area to be searched and the items to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.106" offset="2044343">In the case of container searches, this benefit is essentially absent, because the item has already been seized, the area of the search is quite clear, and in the case of a paper bag, there is no practical way to limit the scope of the search inside the paper bag.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.682" offset="4922723">In automobiles, as the Court explained in Chadwick, in contrasting automobiles to luggage, the privacy interest is significantly less in automobiles than in luggage, and that is why the Court held that a warrant is required for luggage and not for automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.315" offset="4985208">So, it does seem to me that the question before you can impose a warrant requirement on containers is whether there is any substantial basis for saying that a container is more private than the locked glove compartment of a car or the trunk of a car.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.686" offset="5330651">--Well, I am not sure that I can think of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.372" offset="5345384">As I say, I think it is relevant in terms of the permissible scope of search incident to arrest, but if we are talking about an investigative search on probable cause, and whether a warrant is required, after all, for a search incident you don't need probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.476" offset="5405884">That is one of the reasons the warrant requirement has nothing to do with search incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.879" offset="5423438">In any event, let me get back briefly to the benefits of the warrant procedure, because I think it is very important for the Court to have in mind the limited extent to which those benefits apply to searches of insubstantial or low privacy containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.952" offset="5491775">In addition to the particularly benefit there is also the notice benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.371" offset="5509433">That is, the warrant provides notice to the person whose property is being searched that the search has been judicially authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.243" offset="5540885">Again, in the case of the container search, the search on the spot is the only one that the defendant is likely to observe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.224" offset="5580800">Otherwise, he is going to be locked away in a cell, and the search won't even take place in his presence, and the notice function is a pretty insubstantial function in the context of container searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.954" offset="5619775">Now, there is a third function, and it is, I think, the most important one, and the only one that is relevant here, and that is that when the warrant procedure is working properly, it will guard against unjustified searches by overzealous police officers who mistakenly believe they possess probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.541" offset="5686126">The value of this benefit, I submit, is inescapably tied to the privacy interest that is generally associated with the thing or the place to be searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.364" offset="5733355">In those areas where society attaches high privacy value, the home or office, mail, telephone communications, the damage to Fourth Amendment interests caused by an unjustified search are high, and accordingly the prophylaxis of the warrant procedure, if it succeeds in preventing even a few unjustified searches, is well worth its cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.543" offset="5822171">But, I repeat, the value of the warrant requirement here is solely a product of the costs associated with the unjustified search which is going to be prevented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.882" offset="5867520">If the search is of an area that is unlikely to contain anything very private, the costs of a mistake in the search are dramatically reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.285" offset="5905136">For example, in Robbins, if the officer had been mistaken in believing that the parcel contained marijuana bricks, and instead had found that it contained highway flares, as one judge suggested it looked like, the costs of the officer seeing the highway flares in terms of an invasion on Robbins' personal privacy would have been relatively slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.743" offset="6006909">This is also true in cases involving, for instance, burlap bags full of marijuana, which might turn out to contain straw if the officer is mistaken, and generally in cases of containers, grocery bags and other things that don't ordinarily contain highly private items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.625" offset="6086426">Now, against these very limited benefits when we are talking about container searches, we have to weigh the costs in terms of two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.105" offset="6140343">One is the governmental resources consumed in the warrant procedure, and again, I... it is very easy to pooh-pooh, as the ACLU has done in its amicus brief, the costs of the warrant procedure as though they were a moderate convenience, like having a remote control to turn on and off your television set, but it is hardly a matter of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.376" offset="6237414">It is a matter of taking working law enforcement officers away from their other duties for a substantial period of time while they get a warrant, and I think it is the duty of this Court not to require those kinds of procedures unless it is satisfied that some substantial protection of Fourth Amendment interests is going to be derived from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.900" offset="6315572">The second is the point that I have already discussed with Justice Marshall, which is even the interests of the innocent suspect are not well guarded by this rule, because that individual may be subject to a custodial arrest lasting some hours before the magistrate decides there is not probable cause and orders him released, and I suspect that, to use the greater intrusion, lesser intrusion analogy, most people would vastly prefer an immediate search if you are dealing with a low privacy container than they would the alternative of arrest, seizure, warrant procedure, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.181" offset="6472620">Now, in view of the time, I think I will sit down now if there are no further questions and reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.663" offset="6806570">If that had occurred, and it didn't occur in this case, because actually the substance was not even field tested until after Ross had been arrested, after the vehicle had been taken to the police headquarters, and after the police officer had opened the trunk, removed the... the items, and taken them to the mobile crime lab.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.776" offset="6923076">In the transcript at the trial of this case, the officer testified that it wasn't until after he got to the mobile crime lab that the field test of one of the packages was actually conducted, but the point is that Ross in this case was initially arrested on a weapons charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.519" offset="6994024">After the car was stopped, and the interior of the vehicle was seized, a gun was found in the glove compartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.158" offset="7024536">It was at that point that he was placed under arrest, and he was handcuffed, and he was securely in police custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.914" offset="10847608">When you have a search incident to an arrest, you are attempting either to seize evidence immediately associated with the person or means by which the individual can escape, and therefore this Court and other courts have permitted a search not only of the person, a full-blown search of the person, but also of the immediate area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.857" offset="10943425">But in this particular case, in the Ross case, as in the Robbins case, this wasn't a search incident to an arrest, because the arrest had been effected, and when... once again I stress this inherent mobility factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.272" offset="11009045">If... if this factor is applied in these types of cases, we don't have to worry about paper bags and cardboard boxes and shaving kits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.784" offset="11043109">We only have to look at whether or not the exigencies permitted the scope of the intrusion at the particular time, and if that is removed, then any search conducted without a warrant is... is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.323" offset="11117192">Now, I still don't understand the government's argument as to the costs involved in obtaining a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.556" offset="11146136">We are talking about, in this type of case, essentially a one or two-page affidavit, an affidavit that could have been prepared within the time period that the processing in this case occurred, an affidavit that could have been taken to the magistrate either that evening or the following day, or even telephoned in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.252" offset="11364937">So, even assuming it is midnight or 2:00 o'clock in the morning, the magistrate on duty could take the oral affidavit, and could give the authorization to conduct the search under the amendment to the rule, and it is that technology which I think undercuts the government's argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.626" offset="11526478">--Oh, I think there is a difference, because assuming you have a single law enforcement officer who is covering 90 square miles of territory in a vehicle, and he encounters a situation such as Robbins, for example, and it is going to take maybe... maybe 45 minutes or an hour before he gets backup, the exigencies of that situation may permit a result which is different from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.192" offset="11648731">That is why the exigent circumstances factor has a plasticity and a flexibility which allows it to be applied nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.329" offset="11685303">So, of course, problems of law enforcement are much different in sparsely populated areas than they are in large metropolitan areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.229" offset="11728875">In this case, we had three police officers on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.807" offset="11743190">They were there within ten minutes of the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.665" offset="11754580">They took the vehicle back to the police headquarters within... within minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.067" offset="11788225">And to further undercut the government's argument, the following day, as the record of this case will show, when the complaint was filed with the magistrate, that complaint contained a statement of facts, a probable cause statement of facts which was really tantamount to a warrant affidavit, so there was no reason in this case why a warrant could not have been obtained, any more than there was a reason in Robbins for not obtaining a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.743" offset="11906926">We submit that Robbins is good law, that the... that the plurality of opinion in the case is good because it... it upholds the... the philosophical and the considerations of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.831" offset="11971291">It places the... the judicial branch of the government before the executive, and of course the more you whittle away on the warrant requirements, the more danger you have of... of one branch actually encroaching on the powers of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.338" offset="12049345">So, we submit that the warrant requirement has a real function, and that this business about the warrant in the case of a dwelling sets the perimeter of the search, that's not the... that's not the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.612" offset="12118413">The point is that it places a natural and detached magistrate between the citizen and the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.205" offset="12140774">And look at the savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.157" offset="12148611">If there had been an affidavit in support of a search warrant in this case, we probably wouldn't be here, because the reviewing court could look at the face of the affidavit and determine whether or not the affidavit established probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.790" offset="12219141">I could recite that affidavit to this Court within five minutes, as to what was needed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.206" offset="12280790">The observations of the police officer which corroborated the fact that the car was there and the defendant matched the description given by the informant would have been the second paragraph, and the third paragraph would have recited that after the defendant had been arrested, the police officers observed two containers in the trunk compartment of the car, and they had probable cause to believe that they contained narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.241" offset="12384862">These containers could have been seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.912" offset="12391549">The magistrate or the judge could have given his authorization, and they could have been opened, and instead of having a evidentiary hearing in which a police officer, counsel, and the court were involved, say, an hours of testimony... in this case there were 109 pages of transcript on this motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.403" offset="12489561">If there had been a warrant, the judge would have been able to pass upon the legality of the search by looking at the affidavit, unless you can show that the affidavit could be attacked, as in Franks versus Delaware, but you would have to prove at that point that the police officer deliberately lied.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3696.265" offset="14784993">Justice Stevens asked my colleague about lifting up a blanket that might be covering some items in the back of the car, and I think this touches upon the point which, as far as I am aware, is the only substantive argument of policy advanced for requiring warrants for searching insubstantial containers, and that is the bright line test, argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.379" offset="14893453">Now, we submit that the bright line argument that if you require a warrant for all containers officers will know what they have to do is faulty for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.031" offset="14940056">The first reason is that your power is only to prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment, and there is a limit to the extent to which you can characterize reasonable searches as unreasonable for purposes of applying a bright line test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.039" offset="15016124">But in any event, it is illusory to suppose that you will have a bright line test by the all container rule suggested in the Robbins plurality, and in the opinion of the court of appeals below, since there is enormous room for confusion, as your question pointed out, over what constitutes a container.</text>

            <text syncTime="3792.414" offset="15169620">We do agree with Justice Powell's analytical framework, although not with his actual application of his analysis to the facts of Robbins.</text>

            <text syncTime="3801.409" offset="15205564">Mr. Frey, may I ask this question about your bright line point insofar as it is relevant to a choice between the two submissions that the government makes?</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.719" offset="15242867">One is that there are two kinds of containers, private and non-private, and your second submission is that once you can get into the car, you can search everything within the car that might contain the contraband for which you are searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.558" offset="15286230">Which of the two submissions would be better from a law enforcement standpoint in terms of simplicity of the rule?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3828.650" offset="15314547">That... that was the point that I was coming to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.149" offset="15324578">Our position is, of course, that if you do need a bright line, then in the context of an automobile it is unquestionable that the bright line is... is supplied by the rule that you may search containers within an automobile instead of trying to decide whether something is a container or is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.844" offset="15395318">As we pointed out in our brief, there is a First Circuit case that held a rolled up raincoat from which a walkie-talkie fell out when it was unrolled was a container.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.888" offset="15435546">Pockets of clothing, pillow cases stuffed with stolen goods, shopping bags open at the top but not revealing to plain view all of their contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.132" offset="15488522">All you are going to do is shift the area of uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.537" offset="15502106">You are not going to relieve any uncertainty, and in fact, the post-Chadwick experience in dealing with the expectation of privacy analysis has shown very little confusion on the part of the courts between discerning what kinds of containers have high privacy attributes and require the additional prophylaxis of a warrant requirement to protect privacy interests and what kinds of containers don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.277" offset="15593012">Now, I wanted to make a point briefly about telephonic warrants, because that was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.087" offset="15624255">Telephonic warrants are to be used only in extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.257" offset="15644944">The policy of the Department of Justice and I think the policy under the rule is that it is only to be used in cases where there is something on the verge of exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.860" offset="15687367">It is normally designed, in fact, for the Wyoming kind of case, where the magistrate may be several hundred miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.687" offset="15714743">You are still required to write out in full your warrant application, and then read it over the phone for the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.808" offset="15743164">The time savings from a telephonic warrant which, as I say, would never be used in a case like this, are in fact very slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.962" offset="15771794">Now, I think that my colleague has been put in a position of essentially arguing for overruling the automobile search exception, because I think he implicitly acknowledges that it makes no sense to say that automobiles can be searched as a matter of expectation of privacy analysis without a warrant, but containers cannot be searched, and I think it is quite clear from the recent decisions of this Court, and Chadwick says so explicitly, that the automobile search exception is not based on exigency that occurs at the time the item is searched.</text>

            <text syncTime="4010.700" offset="16042736">I think there is... I mean, I think a glove compartment is probably a relatively private area compared to many kinds of containers that may be searched which may be governed by the decision in this case.</text>
