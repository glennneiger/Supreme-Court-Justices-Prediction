            <text syncTime="889.360" offset="3691423">Prior to 1960 there were three... in 1960 we annexed to entire county and the city wanted to maintain control, so three were appointed and two were elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.794" offset="3737190">Of course, the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.527" offset="3752132">In 1964, just prior to it, the legislature passed a local and private bill which said in any xx where 14 and 15 intersect, which is Winston County.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.694" offset="3796749">xx it was because of Section 90(p) of the Mississippi Constitution and because of another related case involving some of the same language, it was not sought to be put into effect until Petitioners filed a suit, and we were ultimately mandated to do so by the Mississippi Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.591" offset="3880341">In anticipation, we submit that all the decisions that I have cited in my brief...

            <text syncTime="963.190" offset="3986816">And counsel opposite in his brief asked for the relief to be prospective in nature, but we like the language in Perkins versus Matthews that with a good faith compliance by us with the Act that we feel that the decision of this honorable Court should be remedial or retrospective, because we sought before this Court a stay, both prior to the granting of certiorari and after the granting of certiorari, and before the elections were held and after the elections were held and the trustees adjudicated into office.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="1024.743" offset="4232994">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.414" offset="4247622">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Mississippi Supreme Court to review that court's judgment ordering the election of trustees to the Louisville School District to proceed under changed election procedures without first obtaining preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and notwithstanding an objection to the changed procedures by the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.778" offset="4357128">The ultimate issue is whether the Mississippi court erred in mandating implementation of the voting change in the absence of Section 5 preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.180" offset="4402685">Before addressing that question, which we believe requires an affirmative response, Respondents have raised the threshold question whether this Court can properly reach the Section 5 inquiry in light of the procedural history of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.547" offset="4472171">Very briefly, that procedural history is that the Louisville School District since 1960 has embraced the whole of Winston County, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.338" offset="4527341">The school board in 1960 consisted of five trustees, three of whom were appointed by city officials of Louisville and two of whom were elected at large by qualified electors outside of Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.740" offset="4580945">In 1964 the Mississippi legislature enacted legislation applicable to the Louisville School District requiring each of the trustees to be elected from a different one of five supervisory districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.562" offset="4644266">Believing this legislation to be a special law which is prohibited by the Mississippi constitution, the city officials of Louisville did not implement that change in 1964, or indeed thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.227" offset="4702884">And in 1975 the Respondents commenced this action in chancery court of Winston County seeking enforcement of the '64 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.817" offset="4745307">The chancery court ruled that the statute was indeed a special law which violated the Mississippi constitution and declined to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.296" offset="4787208">An appeal was taken to the Mississippi Supreme Court and that court reversed, concluding that the constitutionality of the '64 statute could be saved without doing violence to legislative intent by removing by court order the phrase limiting the act's applicability only to the Louisville district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.913" offset="4873621">The case was then remanded to the chancery court for further proceedings not inconsistent with that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.989" offset="4901937">Petitioners sought rehearing in the Mississippi Supreme Court and raised for the first time on rehearing the question of the applicability of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to the '64 statute as modified by the Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.106" offset="4970483">That rehearing was denied without any mention whatsoever of the Section 5 issue, and this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.775" offset="5001098">On remand the chancery Section ordered an election to be held pursuant to the '64 statute, set forth procedures to govern that election, and then entertained the Section 5 question and ruled specifically that the election of all five trustees from supervisor districts was an election change requiring preclearance under Section 5, and then ordered that that change be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States for Section 5 review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.481" offset="5127949">It was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.543" offset="5136204">The Attorney General objected to the majority vote requirement in the new election procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.868" offset="5161490">Following that, the chancery court denied a motion to eliminate or sever the majority vote requirement and simply to allow standing the Mississippi statute relating to election of five trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.065" offset="5230244">It said it would not... it could not sever that because the statutory framework in Mississippi required that that particular requirement did indeed apply to the Louisville School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.059" offset="5278205">And since that couldn't be severed, the chancery court reiterated that the election under the '64 statute was subject to compliance with the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.726" offset="5320941">That prompted Respondent's second appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, and on that second appeal the Mississippi Supreme Court, relying on the law of the case doctrine, reversed as to the part of the decree that required compliance with Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.688" offset="5400772">Now, Respondents' claim is that, as I understand it, is that the first decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court on rehearing was a final judgment on the federal question as to Section 5 applicability at the time that it was rendered and it came to this Court on certiorari, and thus the argument is made that because that was a final judgment at that time and certiorari had been denied, that this Court is precluded now to take up the federal question on the applicability of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.108" offset="5574434">There is, however, in response to that, there's nothing at all in that first Mississippi decision to suggest that it embraced a final disposition of the Section 5 issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.399" offset="5627619">Indeed, that first decision did not even speak to the Section 5 issue, and that... the contention that it did dispose of the federal question comes up, if at all, only with respect to the much later reference the second time around by the Mississippi Supreme Court to law of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.486" offset="5704001">Our view is that until that second decision, neither the parties, nor indeed the chancery court which on remand reviewed the federal question, or indeed this Court were alerted to the Mississippi Supreme Court's post for characterization of its first ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.148" offset="5782577">Indeed, that first ruling by its terms was certainly susceptible to the understand by everybody that it was a non-final decision as to Section 5, it didn't speak to it, and that the Section 5 question was one that was available to the parties to litigate in chancery court on remand, which indeed they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.170" offset="5882679">Surely if the first decision is one that does not by its terms give anybody an indication of finality, the parties cannot be barred from Supreme Court review of the federal question, nor can this Court be estopped from ruling on that issue in the absence of notice that it was indeed a final judgment at the time that it came here the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.960" offset="6113810">But if there is nothing in the first Mississippi opinion at the time that it's rendered, decision at the time it's rendered, to give an indication that there was a final judgment on the merits of the federal question issue at that time, we think that this Court is not precluded nor are the litigants precluded from re-addressing that or addressing that issue when it comes up now on this grant of certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.413" offset="6255707">And as to stuff that might have been litigated, you would have no notice that the judgment affected that, because the judgment by definition wouldn't speak of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.715" offset="6368870">And our view is that the issue on the merits is properly here and that the grant of certiorari was a proper grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.960" offset="6413905">On the merits, the decision of the Mississippi court I think did mandate that this election go into effect prior to any preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.672" offset="6476703">And in doing so, that was error if the change, the voting change in question, was a covered change under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.870" offset="6525500">We have briefed the question as to whether it was a covered change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.338" offset="6547338">We think it's undisputed, first, that there was an election here that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.913" offset="6565624">Second, this election change, even though it occurred by legislation prior to '64, did not go into effect until after November of '64, and this Court's decision in Perkins v. Matthews, Justice Brennan's decision, makes it clear that a change which goes into effect after '64 is one that is a covered change notwithstanding that it's pursuant to legislation that was passed prior to '64.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.634" offset="6692579">And then the only other question that really relates to whether it's a covered change is whether or not this is a court-ordered change as opposed to a legislative change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.426" offset="6743675">I think that on that, first, it's clearly legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.642" offset="6764572">The Mississippi Supreme Court, when it held the statute constitutional, did so with some modification or redrafting of that statute, but did that after it determined that its change was fully consistent with the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.605" offset="6828416">But beyond that, this Court has never held that a court-ordered change by a state court would be immune from preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.023" offset="6866137">The most that we have heard is in the East Carroll Parish case that there are some court-ordered changes pursuant to the federal court reapportionment plans that might be immune from Section 5 preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.143" offset="6926636">But as to state court changes, it's never been held that that doctrine would apply, and so even if this were by some stretch to be considered a state court's... I mean, a court-ordered change, it would not be immune from Section 5 review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.386" offset="6979612">We think that, given the fact that the question of whether it's a covered change is one that has to be resolved in favor of coverage, that's the extent of the inquiry by the Mississippi court, and if you rule that it is a covered change the Mississippi court was in error to order the election to go into effect prior to preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.689" offset="7080759">And we do think that's the effect of the order and it has to be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.345" offset="9103368">Even the legislature of the State of Mississippi saw that the one-man, one-vote theory was being violated and they even enacted a statute before the Voting Rights Act took effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.934" offset="9153732">No one was ever successful in court or in the legislature or anywhere else to get relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.586" offset="9188318">So I filed a suit for the citizens of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.975" offset="9201901">There are more people living outside the city limits than live inside the city limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.236" offset="9238995">There are vastly more students attending the school system that reside outside of the city limits as compared to inside the city limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.467" offset="9279851">When we got to the U.S. district court... this is back about seven years ago, July of 1975, before the people could ever get a hearing in the U.S. district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.305" offset="9335230">The United States district court ruled as a matter of comity that the federal court did have jurisdiction of the matter, true enough, and that there were federal questions raised there, the one-man, one-vote theory undoubtedly and undisputedly being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.626" offset="9408478">But he thought that it was better... and there are many federal decisions to uphold his theory... that the State of Mississippi in the state courts ought to first be granted the right to pass upon those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.057" offset="9478277">And he put in his order of July 1, 1975, that he retained jurisdiction and gave the citizens 60 days in which to file a suit in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.301" offset="9543270">If they didn't file a suit within 60 days the case was to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.861" offset="9561451">In his order he cited four federal decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.264" offset="9579110">You can read it in the record on pages 80 and 81: Meridian versus Bell Telephone Company... I have the citation that he gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.074" offset="9618293">It's not in the appendix, it's in the record that's come up from the Mississippi Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.165" offset="9646715">I have it in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.336" offset="9651312">It's on pages... I just made a note of what page it appeared on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.429" offset="9671688">80 and 81 is where it appears in the record that came up from the state supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.005" offset="9694048">Well, we promptly filed our suit in the state court and we... they all agreed and we dictated and stipulated into the record that all supervisor districts were in compliance with the Justice Department rules and that all five of the supervisor districts do come into the city limits of the city of Louisville, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.181" offset="9802718">And it was long after that until any black ever served on the board of trustees for the Louisville Municipal Separate School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.472" offset="9859874">Mr. Mayo made reference to the fact that one had been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.282" offset="9879100">It was only after the state court ordered him to submit the matter to the United States Department of Justice that a black ever served on the school board under the appointed system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.261" offset="9939077">They got a white person to resign so they could appoint a black lady to serve as school board trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.568" offset="9976275">She's the one and only lady that has ever served under the appointive system on the school board, and that was only recently, after the court ordered that the plan be submitted to the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.702" offset="10044821">They got a person to resign and then appointed a black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.843" offset="10061435">She's out of office now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.061" offset="10066241">She got beat in the election, too, like the other four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.715" offset="10080870">All five... when the people did get a chance to vote and an opportunity to vote, every trustee that was in office ran for reelection also and every one of them got beat in the election, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.146" offset="10142623">And the majority of the people... like I say, there are more people living outside of the city limits than live inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.860" offset="10193405">There are more people being outside the city limits than inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.686" offset="10212736">But it was not only white people that were not being permitted to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.730" offset="10244919">The blacks that lived outside the city limits were deprived of their right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.337" offset="10271355">The Indians that lived outside the city limits of Louisville, Mississippi, were being deprived of their right to vote just like the white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.879" offset="10309493">And so, when we filed the lawsuit we filed it as more or less a class action in behalf of reds, blacks, whites, and the concerned citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.609" offset="10360484">Then after this matter got back from the Mississippi Supreme Court ruling that the chancellor must have an election... and they ought to be congratulated on the opinion they wrote in that case, because they called attention to the bench and bar of the federal point that... and it's in the appendix, their opinion... that the one-man, one-vote law must be complied with in the state of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.060" offset="10534251">However, they said they didn't have to reach that point since there was already a statute that said that they did have to have an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.556" offset="10568210">But if it had not been for the statute they would still have called an election because of the one-man, one-vote theory being violated, in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the state of Mississippi and the laws of the land as announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.735" offset="10656922">Now, he brought Mr. Mayo... and one of the Justices here I believe was concerned about, should they put the old trustees back in office in the event of a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.167" offset="10706659">Let me call your attention to this factor: The court ruled that the trustees that were serving were never legal trustees at all, and the court order just provided that they could only continue to serve until they could have the election and the election should be held as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.284" offset="10795162">One order on that is in the record on page 97, and there's another order on page 225 of the record that's brought up from the Mississippi Supreme Court, saying that they were never legal trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.152" offset="10866633">They certainly weren't at that time, and only over our objection they granted them the power to stay in office until the election can be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.882" offset="10909578">Well, the chancellor, like they say, ordered the matter sent to the Justice Department, the U.S. Attorney General, for his approval or disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.953" offset="10965794">That was done on July the 24th, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.405" offset="10983661">He did not make any ruling within 60 days one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.247" offset="11006963">The chancellor could have gone ahead and called the election, but he simply wouldn't do it, and it was March 28th, 1980, before the Attorney General ever made any ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.959" offset="11065895">And his only objection, by the way, is not to keep down the election; his only objection was that the plurality theory ought to win as compared to the runoff election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.281" offset="11119185">Well, so we go back into court and file a petition with the chancellor saying, all right, we don't care whether they have a plurality election or whether they have a runoff election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.493" offset="11195985">That's in the record there on page 249 of the record brought up from the Mississippi Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.490" offset="11227959">And I believe that petition is printed in the appendix, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.317" offset="11243319">And the petition says that it's immaterial to us, because our interest is the interest in the schools and the children, who are going to teach our children, who are going to be trustees of our schools; and that we also prayed that if the court found it necessary to join the Attorney General in as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.307" offset="11331195">And he refused to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.463" offset="11339867">But we agreed in writing and filed it, we'd go along with the Attorney General's ruling on the plurality on May 15, 1980, when we filed that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.395" offset="11391590">Well, the chancellor said, I'm not going to let him have the election yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.737" offset="11413010">See, it had been since 1960, been that way; still no election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.219" offset="11430878">And now it's gone on up to May 15, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.374" offset="11447492">The Attorney General's already ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.124" offset="11454492">The chancellor says, still can't get any election, because the Attorney General said a plurality man has to win, the one that gets the most votes at the first election when the first election's held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.617" offset="11516455">And the state law says on school districts, municipal school districts, requires a runoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.457" offset="11551877">So due to that conflict, I can't grant your petition to go along with the Attorney General and have the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.861" offset="11581448">So I had to go back to the Mississippi Supreme Court again with them, and so when we got back up to the Mississippi Supreme Court they required them to hold the election and ordered the first order enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.337" offset="11659397">And we did finally have the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.633" offset="11672563">They tried to... and then the Justice Department did come in and file some papers up there at Aberdeen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.182" offset="12262721">But also, there was another reason that they ruled maybe in that manner, because of the law of the case theory, which I'm going to get down to argue if I have time to in just a few moments here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.710" offset="12768870">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.974" offset="12789872">I want to submit that the Attorney General is not a party to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.799" offset="12825190">He only got in it in the form of amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.672" offset="12840654">Actually, he got here to the U.S. Supreme Court... now, he didn't appear in the lower court and according to the Mississippi Supreme Court opinion everybody agreed to the manner of holding the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.040" offset="12906169">He says in his own brief that his remedy is to file the lawsuit in the district court, have a three-judge federal panel is what it amounts to, and that's on file and active at Aberdeen, Mississippi, in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.782" offset="12989134">And we're not trying to avert the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act or anything of that nature here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.919" offset="13025706">These people have waited all these years to get an election and just now have accomplished that purpose, and I surely would say that the Court should let them stay in in the event of a reversal, because the other group stayed in much longer without any legal authority at all.</text>
