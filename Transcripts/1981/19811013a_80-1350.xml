            <text syncTime="52.116" offset="349207">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Plaintiff in this case is a cable television operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.186" offset="377419">As such a business, it is a medium of communication, supplying news, information, and entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.142" offset="417230">This includes the origination of programs as well as rebroadcast of broadcast signals and the performance of editorial functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.330" offset="454010">So, as we look at it from the restraint of trade problems, we are dealing with a restraint of trade and business in the commerce of ideas.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="87.686" offset="491418">Are you arguing an antitrust pre emption, or are you arguing First Amendment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="95.340" offset="522033">We are arguing an antitrust exemption or pre emption in terms of a restraint of the First Amendment trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.779" offset="559859">I don't think we can separate the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.648" offset="567277">As I understand, it is the posture of the Court that when you are dealing with antitrust you deal on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.902" offset="596326">You would have to look at the nature of the industry and the nature of the particular restraint, and so I don't think as we deal with the question of exemption we can ignore the fact that we are dealing with a First Amendment... trade and commerce under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.293" offset="649824">That is certainly our posture in the case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="130.845" offset="664035">Well, what if the City of Boulder had franchised two streetcar companies in the old days to one handle the north side of town and the other handle the south side of the town, and in each of those streetcars there were the typical advertising things that you find in streetcars or buses?</text>
            <text syncTime="156.226" offset="765599">Would you feel that was unconstitutional under either the antitrust laws or under the First Amendment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="165.232" offset="801648">I would assume that the advertiser would have access to either one of the transit companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.736" offset="819620">The transit companies are dealing with a franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.086" offset="829024">I think the concept, the connotation of franchise in terms of cable television is totally inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.409" offset="854311">It implies a special privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.492" offset="862670">For example, your transit car had one half of the town, it had a special privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.413" offset="882314">The advertiser, though, he had access to either one of those fellows.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="189.015" offset="896734">But the cable television, the two competing cable television companies certainly don't have access to the entire town.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.303" offset="929961">One has access to one side of the town, the other has access to the other side.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="201.339" offset="946053">You are equating public utility type activity, commercial type activity, if you want to, with the trade of First Amendment, and you are equating a business that ought to be licensed and free for all, subject to reasonable restrictions, to a business that is a special privilege.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="225.204" offset="1041557">Because I think... because there is a current trend among some of the cities in recent years to take the posture that because we are the guardians of the streets, the proprietors of the streets, the landlords of the streets, we can elect and say that we are going to choose one monopolist who only that monopolist can be in the cable television business and purvey the trade of information, news and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.336" offset="1146046">I think that is totally wrong.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="252.238" stopTime="264.079">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="252.238" offset="1149599">How different is that from zoning?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.372" offset="1158167">When you say that one theater shall be built on this block, and we just don't want any other theaters within a mile of it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="264.079" offset="1197037">Well, I think that it is different in this respect, that one deals specifically with land use.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.583" offset="1227026">As such, it is a traditional area of government regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.720" offset="1243535">It must have some rational basis, and whatever, and what have you, but let's, instead of talking about theaters, let's talk about newspapers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="283.557" stopTime="286.676">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="283.557" offset="1274882">Well, my question is about theaters.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_r_farrow" startTime="286.676" stopTime="317.464">
            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="286.676" offset="1287421">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.695" offset="1291496">As to theaters, if there were some logical reason why that you had to put them 1,000 feet apart, as, for example, they had a demonstrated cause and fact of producing some evil that you wanted to cure, such as a red light district, as I think happens, then the question of the zoning power to say, you can all be in the theater business but you've got to keep a little distance between yourselves, seems like a time, place, and manner restriction, and what we are dealing with here--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="317.464" stopTime="333.824">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="317.464" offset="1410510">And it may well be in the number of square miles comprised in the City of Boulder that there are many more applicants for theater licenses than there are permissible sites.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_r_farrow" startTime="333.824" stopTime="337.209">
            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="333.824" offset="1476025">--For theater licenses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="337.209" stopTime="338.159">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="337.209" offset="1489504">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_r_farrow" startTime="338.159" stopTime="624.006">
            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="338.159" offset="1493370">Well, I would think that when that happened, then the price of theaters would go up, and he who wanted to be in the theater business would go out and buy out an existing theater, pay a higher price, but not be excluded from the market just because he owned another.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.169" offset="1557423">If there is only room for 15 of them, and the price, like liquor licenses, go up, he still is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.572" offset="1583023">You don't have... you don't have a time, place, and manner restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.809" offset="1603921">What we are dealing with in this case is, we are dealing with no time, no place, no manner, no how is this company allowed to do business in two thirds of the city, and the only justification we have for it is is that it might be, it might be a natural monopoly, and I think it is just... it is extraordinarily different from the circumstance of a couple of theaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.960" offset="1708515">I think that one of the confusions we deal with in this thing is, we forget the nature of the particular regulation here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.284" offset="1761805">We are not dealing with any kind of traditional zoning law, like public utility regulation or commercial regulation, or selling raisins, or even... we are not even dealing with a question of regulation of cable television, because there is not a single regulation adopted yet about how you conduct the business of cable television.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.050" offset="1848949">We are not dealing with safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.983" offset="1856681">There is no issue of safety involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.835" offset="1863996">We are not dealing with whether or not you steal from your customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.787" offset="1875803">We are not saying that you can't go out and electrocute your customers, or scare the horses, or anything of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.255" offset="1897746">We are dealing with a decision that one city makes that says we think there might be a natural monopoly, and you, this particular company, almost like a bill of pains and penalties, you may not even think about operating over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.331" offset="1958037">Now, it would seem to me it would take the most extraordinary kind of a justification to do that, and the only one I know of in the case law is those dealing with physical impossibility, but in this case we have both in Boulder... pardon me, Mache One and again in Mache Two, specific findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.376" offset="2018223">There is no physical impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.376" offset="2026164">There is no physical impediment.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.078" offset="2033060">Not only is there room for four on the poles, but after that you can go underground and you've got all the ground from here to China.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.416" offset="2058347">So that we are not dealing with physical shortage or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.553" offset="2082902">The suggestion that we are dealing with economic scarcity is a justification for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.153" offset="2093351">I think it is brand new to the whole concept of First Amendment freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.540" offset="2106830">Brand new.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.657" offset="2111323">And while we are touching that point, I think one of the extraordinary things is in Boulder, too, now, which has now clarified its holding in Boulder One dealing with the antitrust issue and then brought up this question of economic scarcity.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.316" offset="2169942">We have this funny situation where the Appellate Court has twice now set aside or ignored the specific findings of fact of the Trial Court without reviewing the Trial Court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.274" offset="2217798">As far as we can tell, nobody but Judge Markey has ever looked at the record other than Judge Mache.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.761" offset="2239741">In that record, in that very record dealing with economic scarcity, there is a document there produced by BCC, the co conspirator, put in evidence by the City of Boulder, which contains a five year economic projection of BCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.521" offset="2306823">Now, you remember that BCC were the people who said in July of 1979, give us a permit, we are prepared today to compete with this company, and the city said, no, no, we want to stop and think about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.245" offset="2349664">We are going to think that maybe it's a natural monopoly, and then make it a natural monopoly, or make it an unnatural monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.065" offset="2372966">That piece of paper in there, that five year projection, demonstrated that BCC anticipated putting $1.3 million in equity in Year One and none thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.140" offset="2417269">In the fourth year, they anticipated a $3.9 million distribution to the partners, and as of the time they anticipated distribution they would have recovered all but $45,000 of their $1.3 million by depreciation, by the recapture of capital, and they would still own a business that in its fifth year they anticipated would produce $85,000 worth of taxable net income, and $490,000 more worth of cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.928" offset="2552374">Now, you know, evidence of economic scarcity is just not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.998" offset="2568675">The contrary is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.432" offset="2578392">That is why we say, you know, that the major error with this case and the finding in the major distribution areas is that the Circuit, the Tenth Circuit has refused to review the record, refused to look at the record.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="624.006" stopTime="637.665">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="624.006" offset="2636698">But certainly we don't ordinarily take cases in which the Court of Appeals has held or disagreed with findings of the District Court, do we?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_r_farrow" startTime="637.665" stopTime="809.977">
            <label>Mr. Harold R. Farrow</label>
            <text syncTime="637.665" offset="2691346">I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.784" offset="2703885">I think that... of course, I can't guess why you took the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.169" offset="2717364">I would think there are two logical reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.769" offset="2723738">One is, it does deal with the cable television industry, which is an emerging First Amendment speaker, and is of very significant national import, and there are certainly current abuses being reported daily in the press of this concept of the RFP process.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.231" offset="2793641">The other thing is, we have the concept that a city in the State of Colorado has apparently decided that because it is a home rule city, that it is... it is the sovereign, and free to take the kind of action it took, apparently on the theory that because it represents directly the people of the state by its constitutional stature, it has the power, and then of course it supervises it, it satisfies the tests of LaFayette and Midcalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.518" offset="2918820">Well, it got that lofty status, if it got it at all, by virtue of that state constitution, and that state constitution says in it, I think it is Article 10, Section 2, that constitution...</text>
            <text syncTime="712.646" offset="2991232">"No law shall be passed impairing the freedom of speech. "</text>
            <text syncTime="717.865" offset="3012130">"Every person shall be free to speak, write, or publish whatever he will on any subject, being responsible for all abuse of that liberty. "</text>
            <text syncTime="729.073" offset="3056956">So, it is difficult for me to understand how a city who claims its power to come from that Constitution can say that same Constitution contemplated to be able to pass something it calls a law that totally locks out a given speaker from two thirds of a city, at the same time saying they are going to hold that two thirds open so they can select another monopolist which they can totally control.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.906" offset="3164371">I just don't believe there is any contemplation, or any mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.294" offset="3177850">I think that is a clear prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.894" offset="3188299">Now, in Boulder Two, we have Judge Seymour, I guess it is, who says in her Footnote Number 3, we didn't say it was purely local in Boulder One.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.452" offset="3230513">I misunderstood her.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.568" offset="3235006">I thought that's what they were saying, and apparently everybody else thought that, because that's the point that is briefed throughout these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.939" offset="3256427">But if she didn't say that, what she was saying then is that there is a local interest and a state interest, and if there is a local interest and a state interest, then of course any state action in the matter is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.997" offset="3304701">Now, there is no specific state statute dealing with cable television, but there are two things that clearly control.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.233" offset="3329674">One is the state antitrust statute, which recognizes its policy of pro competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.573" offset="3354961">And the other thing is the state constitution, which forbids it, just like it forbids the City of Boulder--</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.069" offset="9452985">Are you analogizing cable TV to the sort of traditional type of businesses affected with the public interest, like providing gas, electricity, water, and transportation?</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.262" offset="9509723">In fact, there is no contest over that point in this case, because in the Manor Vail case in the Colorado Supreme Court, a subsidiary of this Petitioner was involved, and in their answer in that case, this Petitioner conceded that cable television was a private business affected with the public interest, and in that case they supported the home rule authority of a Colorado city to fix the rates for cable television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.396" offset="9614317">The fact is that cities have been forced to address problems with cable television in a variety of fronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.400" offset="9642321">Absent price competition, cities have been faced with the question of how do we keep the prices that don't have any price competition in line?</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.405" offset="9678370">Absent service competition, when there is only one provider, how do they provide high quality service that the market would otherwise provide?</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.261" offset="9709717">That is the kind of background that is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.063" offset="9724972">More particularly, there is a traditional line of regulating cable TV in this manner in Colorado, a long prior history of such regulation both from the Federal Government and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.140" offset="9781292">The Federal Communications Commission has since 1972 encouraged local authorities to bring their special expertise, as the Commission called it, to these problems, and has recognized that local cable TV regulation, including the franchise terms, the rates, districting, which is the issue in Boulder Two, and similar cable matters are</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.707" offset="9887558">That is at Page 18 of our brief, where we quote from the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.076" offset="9901037">In terms of traditional city functions, cable strung in the right of way is just the latest development in the use of the right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.515" offset="9930712">We submit that when the people of Colorado in 1902 amended their constitution to give this local autonomy, they did not contemplate that the constitution would have to be amended for each new technological development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.073" offset="9984943">They gave the local autonomy over that right of way to the local city government, run by nine elected council members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.095" offset="10013050">Colorado cities have always recognized that power and exercised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.332" offset="10034053">The amicus brief of the Colorado Municipal League here points out that about 85 cities in Colorado have now regulated cable TV.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.153" offset="10065295">This pattern dates back to the early sixties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.938" offset="10076476">The Colorado Supreme Court has recognized the validity of this kind of regulation by home rule cities in the Manor Vail case, and the Tenth Circuit has now so held twice in this case, Boulder One and Boulder Two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.746" offset="10127676">In Colorado, however, as in the vast majority of states, the state legislatures have chosen not to adopt legislation on cable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.687" offset="13719408">There was a 5 percent proposal in the model ordinance, but the ordinance that has been adopted in this case, including districting, specifically says... we reprinted that in an appendix to our brief, because it was left out of the joint appendix... specifically says that these people will have no increase in their fee whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.251" offset="13793700">The impacts beyond zoning go into a variety of other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.968" offset="13812613">In our brief we discuss low cost housing, waste regulation, as local and traditional governmental functions which in Colorado are only based upon home rule constitutional power, not based on a statutory authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.462" offset="13866530">These kinds of things, we submit, all demonstrate legitimate local concerns which have traditionally been performed at the local level, and which may well have anticompetitive aspects to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.370" offset="13922223">The significance from our standpoint, we would submit, is that if the Petitioner here were to get its way, Colorado home rule cities would be unable to act because the liability for potential treble damages would force them to go back to the legislature each time and in effect do away with the whole home rule principle of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.699" offset="13999545">The Colorado Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Article 20 of the Constitution gives home rule cities, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.003" offset="14024727">"every power theretofore possessed by the legislature. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.622" offset="14039147">Thus, by virtue of Article 20, a home rule city is not inferior to the general assembly concerning its local and municipal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.263" offset="14077703">We submit the Court should respect that allocation of power, and that to do otherwise would have disastrous consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.036" offset="14112812">First, as a practical matter, it would tear asunder the traditional pattern of home rule, because municipal governments couldn't afford to let the clock of treble damages keep on accruing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.808" offset="14147921">They would have to go back and give up their home rule power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.526" offset="14162758">But far more important than that in the long term, and even more troubling from a constitutional standpoint, if home rule cities can only avoid antitrust litigation and achieve immunity by going back to the state legislature each time for renewed authority, then for practical purposes there cannot be any home rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.988" offset="14236632">This result, we submit, is a result the Court should consider carefully and should avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.226" offset="14257635">This is a result, we submit, that Congress never intended the antitrust laws to bring about, whatever their application to ordinary commercial ventures by cities outside their boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.997" offset="14300685">And this is a result which we submit the principles of our system, which the Court has addressed in the National League of Cities case, and the deference traditionally owed to the state constitutional choice by the people in allocating their legislative power does not allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.109" offset="14369126">If the Court has no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3570.453" offset="14422520">I would start off by saying, I commend to you the dissent by Justice Markey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.405" offset="14442268">I think that dissent was one of the more extraordinary documents I have had occasion to read as a lawyer, and of course I loved it, but it, I believe, answered almost every point raised by counsel, opposing counsel today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.580" offset="14491065">Let me quickly just indicate to you this whole business of sovereignty, who is the sovereign, the Supreme Court of the State of Colorado has itself in City of Denver versus Sweet, which is quoted in ours, settled the fact that cities are not sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.988" offset="14548639">They are not city states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.924" offset="14552401">I think the law is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.376" offset="14562223">On the question of regulation, now, we are dealing with regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.744" offset="14575702">We find here that when it is appropriate to talk in terms of proposed 5 percent, we move from the 90-day moratorium to the total prohibition, which came along later on, it says, until 1984, which happened to be the date on which they believe that they are going to be running this Petitioner completely out of town, will only charge 2 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.139" offset="14653233">So that it is sophistry to talk in terms of a 90-day moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.193" offset="14669429">The 90-day moratorium by the very words of the city attorney himself was a contractual ploy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.613" offset="14695134">We will cancel their existing permit, we will enact a new permit with a geographical limitation, they will accept it by performance, by continuing to serve, and we will have them by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.238" offset="14741632">If they don't, they can't operate at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.440" offset="14750409">So that wasn't regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.890" offset="14756260">The only regulation, if you want to call it regulation, is the pure prohibition, which came about in July.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.593" offset="14783114">They said, no time, no place, no manner, no how.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.330" offset="14798056">If you could do that to a newspaper, then maybe you can do it to cable.</text>
