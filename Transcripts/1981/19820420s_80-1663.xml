            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="77463">The third case that I have, 80-1663, International Longshoremen's Association versus Allied International is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.186" offset="154159">Respondent, Allied International is an American importer of Russian wood products.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.400" offset="186968">On January 9, 1980, the petitioner, the International Longshoremen's Association, declared a boycott by its members of cargos arriving from the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.576" offset="251752">The Union took this action to protest the invasion of Afghanistan.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.522" offset="279546">As a result of the boycott, union members refused to unload shipments to Allied with whom the Union had no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.289" offset="318521">Allied's shipments were disrupted completely and it sued for damages as a victim of a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.526" offset="355510">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that Allied had stated a claim for relief under Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act and Section 8(b)(4)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.265" offset="426459">We affirm, as commendable as the Union's ultimate objectives may be, the certain effect of its action was to impose serious losses on neutral employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.106" offset="485809">This is precisely the sort of burden that the secondary boycott previsions of the labor laws were designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.136" offset="521963">The opinion of the Court again is unanimous.</text>
