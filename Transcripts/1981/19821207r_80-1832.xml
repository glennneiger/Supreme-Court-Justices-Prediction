            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="129244">Next we will hear argument in Immigration and Naturalization Service versus Chadha.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.818" offset="172503">Mr. Gressman, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="78.393" stopTime="225.207">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="78.393" offset="442713">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.825" offset="460477">I speak again on this reargument on behalf of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.171" offset="497884">This time I proceed directly to the two critical arguments or contentions of those who seek invalidation of Section 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.445" offset="582939">Those two arguments are:</text>
            <text syncTime="118.279" offset="602269">One, that the legislative review device in that section collides with the presentment clauses of Article I, Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.839" offset="660575">The second contention is that the use of this device violates the general separation of powers doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.816" offset="704460">These arguments must be examined in light of House Resolution 926, an Act adopted in 1975 by which Section 244(c)(2) has been implemented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.863" offset="808637">That examination, I suggest, will show that these two critical contentions in the context of this case are illusory and misplaced, and that the faults in these arguments are so pervasive as to implicate Article III justiciability problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.852" offset="936637">Now, turning to the first argument, the presentment clause argument, one finds that that argument is undermined and indeed destroyed by the negative nature of House Resolution 926.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="225.207" stopTime="228.430">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="225.207" offset="1030051">Where do we find the text of that resolution, Mr. Gressman?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="228.430" stopTime="416.613">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="228.430" offset="1042903">The resolution is incorporated, I think, at page 69A of the appendix to the Government's jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.828" offset="1084490">It reads in whole:</text>
            <text syncTime="242.188" offset="1097969">"That the House of Representatives does not... does not approve the granting of permanent residence in the United States to certain named aliens. "</text>
            <text syncTime="259.940" offset="1168917">including Mr. Chadha.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.103" offset="1177590">That is the total text of House Resolution 926.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.336" offset="1206534">Now, on its face as well as in its legal effect it contains a number of significant negative propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.936" offset="1260973">Let me count the ways in which it is negative:</text>
            <text syncTime="288.059" offset="1281453">One, it does not order the deportation of Mr. Chadha.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.745" offset="1316144">Mr. Chadha came into this Section 244 proceeding conceding that he is deportable because he had earlier violated the statute which... by overstaying his student visa by which he entered this country, and under the statute that overstaying of a visa renders him deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.996" offset="1437143">That is not an issue and never has been in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.428" offset="1450935">Two, House Resolution 926 does not alter Mr. Chadha's legal status quo, which is one of deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.777" offset="1512271">It has no effect on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.669" offset="1519899">Three, it does not adjust Mr. Chadha's status to that of a permanent resident alien, which is what he requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.836" offset="1572562">Three... or four, this resolution does not alter or affect any of Mr. Chadha's personal or individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.409" offset="1646854">It is long established that an alien, a deportable alien who applies for this kind of relief comes to that proceeding with no rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.471" offset="1719056">It is a... as we pointed out last argument, this is essentially a plea for mercy, a plea for grace on the part of the alien who seeks to get his status changed by dispensation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="416.613" stopTime="423.208">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="416.613" offset="1795647">Is it not true that had the resolution not passed all four of the consequences you've described would have taken place?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="423.208" stopTime="605.336">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="423.208" offset="1821979">That is true, but that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.240" offset="1834204">This is a negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.872" offset="1848728">This is a legislative no to all of these consequences that might well ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.437" offset="1882896">That would be a different case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.457" offset="1891046">If either house had disapproved this application, then certain things would have ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.957" offset="1940993">Then we would have had, presumably, some kind of alteration in the legal status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.283" offset="1978295">But the critical point here is that by saying no, none of those consequences occurred and there is no change in the legal status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.865" offset="2056663">To put it differently, there is certainly no kind of enactment of positive law which results from the House action saying no.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.187" offset="2113923">Now, it is significant, I think, that the opponents of this legislative review device, as well as the court below, have been unable to identify any kind of positive law change that occurred as a result of the adoption of House Resolution 926, and that a determination of a positive law change, an identification of it is absolutely essential to the presentment clause argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.550" offset="2271389">And I think they have utterly failed to demonstrate that there is any positive law change here.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.447" offset="2307020">You simply cannot change a legislative no into a legislative yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.112" offset="2337636">Now, this goes straight to what Justice White was speaking about in his opinion in Buckley against Valeo, where he said that the power of either house to vote to disapprove is not the equivalent of legislation or to an order, resolution or vote within the meaning of Article I, Section 7, which requires the concurrence of both houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.394" offset="2470756">Nor does a one-house no require any kind of presentment to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.009" offset="2501267">This is non-legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.260" offset="2510253">This is what happens every day across the street when a house votes down a proposal made by one of its members.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="605.336" offset="2550586">Well, if it's non-legislation I suppose you would have to say it happens across the street 365 days a year--</text>

            <text syncTime="810.801" offset="3372398">That's true with any bill that's proposed over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.374" offset="3386713">If it fails, that's the end of it as far as legislative change of legal status quo is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.618" offset="3423703">Now, the other critical point I want to mention is that House Resolution 926 has three characteristics which reflect a unique sovereign power vested exclusively in the Congress and therefore there can be and is no violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.680" offset="3547941">First, this Court has repeatedly held, and as recently as three weeks ago in Landon against Placencia, that the power to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative that implicates many of our problems with foreign countries and involves consideration of our political and economic circumstances at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.929" offset="3668940">And virtually all of that sovereign power is vested in the Congress, and Congress has in effect created a kind of a public right or a public privilege here which it can dispense in accordance with what it sees most desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.194" offset="3766011">The second point is that House Resolution 926 is essentially a negative answer to a political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.960" offset="3804986">Ever since the Fong Yue Ting decision in 1893, this Court has repeatedly said that the exercise of this power over aliens, this sovereign power, involves answering political questions, in the best sense of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.055" offset="3889414">And this Court has frequently referred to the purely political nature of the legislative power over aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.751" offset="3924209">So that when Congress was saying no or when the House was saying no, it was saying... giving a negative answer to a political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.867" offset="3960676">Finally, House Resolution 926 is saying no within the traditional area of legislative discretion, discretion that is built into 244(c)(2), and is inherent discretion in a legislative body to say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.624" offset="4067673">So we suggest that a combination of these circumstances will, an understanding of what these arguments entail, suggests that both the presentment clause argument and the separation of powers doctrine simply do not apply under the circumstances of this particular case and this particular statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.442" offset="5102958">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.213" offset="5106093">Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.634" offset="5115706">Justice O'Connor, in response to your question, in our reply brief we describe the incident in 1940 in which the Congress considered legislation to deport Harry Bridges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.465" offset="5171086">Attorney General Jackson roundly denounced that effort as totally unprecedented and a violation of all cardinal constitutional principles, and the Congress did not enact that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.355" offset="5230645">And this was at the very time that Attorney General Jackson had been advising the President that he may sign the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which initiated these procedures that are now under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.431" offset="5282890">Last term I stated Petitioner's argument why the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed because of the inseverability of the statute or vacated because of the availability of alternative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.543" offset="5347360">It remains our conviction that this is not an appropriate case in which to decide the merits of legislative review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.577" offset="5379543">However, it is also the view of the Senate that it will serve the public interest to obtain, in an appropriate case or cases, the judgment of this Court on the constitutionality of legislative review procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.297" offset="5438371">To that end, the Senate yesterday docketed in this Court an appeal from the en banc judgment of the District of Columbia Circuit in the Federal Trade Commission case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.376" offset="5486645">The statute in that case authorizes the Congress to disapprove trade regulation rules of the Federal Trade Commission by concurrent resolutions of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.303" offset="5534397">That statute is severable and the Congress in the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act of 1980 established a special procedure to obtain judicial review and the judgment of this Court on its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.724" offset="5596046">We are therefore asking in that case that the Court reach the merits and decide the constitutional questions presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.418" offset="5626870">You're adhering to your position here in this particular case that the statute is not severable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Davidson</label>
            <text syncTime="1380.232" offset="5650171">That is correct, and because it is not severable there is no relief which may be provided to the Petitioner and the issue should be taken up in a case in which effective judicial relief under Article III may be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.241" offset="5702207">In determining whether to ask the Court to resolve the disagreement between its coordinate branches over legislative review, Petitioner has weighed competing considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.399" offset="5750795">On the one side is the need for stability in the structure of government which has been developed in recent years by the political branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.955" offset="5784963">The executive paints a history of legislative overreaching and we have described a history of executive acquiescence or agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.073" offset="5825505">But in fairness and in some detachment, I believe we can all step back and agree that the political participants have joined in the creation of these contemporary governmental arrangements and share responsibility for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.331" offset="5882557">Although the branches may be contending for relative advantage now, the ultimate interest is that of the Government of the United States as a whole in cautiously approaching the devices which are presently used to mediate political powers over arms sales, budget authority, and numbers of other matters to which legislative review has been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.205" offset="5978060">These procedures serve important governmental purposes even when they do not result in actual disapproval, because they establish a framework for consultation and agreement between the political branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.884" offset="6036679">It is one of the ironies of this case that the Senate may be more in agreement with the Ninth Circuit than are the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.290" offset="6066354">That court saw the need for restraint and the need to limit its decision in preference to a precipitous redistribution of present political power and responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.607" offset="6111598">The need for caution must be balanced, however, against the need for authoritative constitutional guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.692" offset="6143990">The Congress may be expected to turn again to legislative review to solve new problems, and it is critically important to know whether such resolutions can be founded securely on procedures for legislative review or whether the Congress and the executive should look to other ways to accommodate their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.115" offset="6225701">Therefore, when a controversy is presented in which the severability of the statute or the lack of alternative relief makes a judgment on the merits appropriate, the Senate will ask the Court, as in the Federal Trade Commission case, to decide the merits of the constitutional issue on appropriately narrow grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.491" offset="6307203">On the merits of the present case, the claim is made that Section 244 abridges the President's role in the legislative process and his responsibility to faithfully execute the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.008" offset="6361224">However, the history of the statute and an examination of its text shows that the statute preserves the balance between the branches while, in Representative Celler's words in 1940,</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.189" offset="6409917">"providing a humane and reasonable solution to an issue over which the Congress and the executive have been at impasse. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.054" offset="6441368">A case which brings into question the process of legislation must begin with a decision made through that process to limit immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.349" offset="6478566">But from the outset that basic legislative decision has been the subject of stresses resulting from the openness of borders and the nation's hospitality to tourists and students and others.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Davidson</label>
            <text syncTime="1634.429" offset="6666857">--Oh, it bears very directly, and it is indeed very difficult to separate the severability point from our analysis on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.215" offset="6706041">Our analysis on the merits is to demonstrate that this particular sharing of power... and it is a sharing of power... is quite unique under the laws; and the two parts of it, the discretion of the Attorney General to make recommendations and the power of the Congress to allow an alien to change his status from deportable under the laws to lawful permanent residence, are integrally related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.594" offset="6823592">One response to the tensions which have resulted from restrictions on immigration has been the periodic consideration of amnesty, and from time to time the Congress has granted discretion to the executive to register as permanent residents aliens who had entered the United States prior to statutorily designated dates, and we are now at a critical moment in the consideration by the Congress of the broadest grant of amnesty ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.023" offset="6937277">Section 244 began in the 1930's as an executive request to the Congress for the power to confer amnesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.528" offset="6975311">The proposal encountered all the problems which amnesty proposals have since encountered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.073" offset="7001433">It is difficult to strike a balance between the compelling circumstances of individuals and the strong national desire to enforce the legislative decision to limit immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.481" offset="7043125">In the course of the seven-year debate which ensued, the Congress considered but could not obtain agreement on various of the alternatives which the Solicitor General has properly described as constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.808" offset="7096415">For example, the Solicitor General correctly suggests that Congressional control may be maintained by a legislative decision to limit a delegation of authority to a specified period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.958" offset="7148973">The House bill in 1937 would have done that, by limiting the availability of relief for a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.464" offset="7183037">But that proposal failed in the Senate, which had been opposed to the grant of any discretion to the executive to grant permanent residence to deportable aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.180" offset="7225877">Or, as the Solicitor General indicated last term, the statute might have been passed to authorize the executive to recommend cancellations of deportations, but to require legislation to actually cancel those deportations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.478" offset="7283138">Indeed, the House-passed bill in 1939 would have established that very procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.254" offset="7306230">But the Administration rejected that as inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.805" offset="7320441">At that point the Congress could have determined that neither bicameral agreement nor agreement with the executive branch to a relief procedure was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.453" offset="7362968">It could have declared that it had done its constitutional best and simply let the affected class be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.629" offset="7395673">But by that time it was May and June of 1940 and an alternative to deportation in time of a world at war was deemed essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.804" offset="7432454">The Congress persisted in its effort to resolve the seven-year impasse and invoked those procedures which contribute to successful political resolutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.489" offset="7471115">First the Congress consulted with the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.622" offset="7483654">Professor Mansfield relates in a contemporary account that the Senate Judiciary Committee substituted a Labor Department draft, and Senator Connally described to the Senate how the Judiciary Committee had called on the Department of Justice</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.472" offset="7543108">"and had the Solicitor General with us. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.434" offset="7554916">I cannot say what attention the Solicitor General paid to the relief provisions of the Alien Registration Act, as there were other important provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.230" offset="7590129">But that Act is not lengthy, and Senator Connally further stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.570" offset="7603504">"We went over all the existing laws and worked the new provisions into existing laws so as to make a harmonious whole. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.377" offset="7634746">Important in this respect, Congress incorporated into the Immigration Act the legislative review procedures of the Reorganization Act of 1939, which Presidents continued to support and which the Department of Justice has supported for decades, until disowning it in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.249" offset="7710188">And then, after fashioning this statute in consultation with the executive, the bill received bicameral support and was presented formally to the executive for the approval of the President, which it received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.807" offset="7760447">Section 244 establishes a procedure to grant permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.690" offset="7779987">It is not a deportation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.271" offset="7790227">The only status which may be changed by Section 244 is from deportability to lawful permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.699" offset="7823977">Under these arrangements, the legal authority for the Attorney General to record the permanent residence of a deportable alien derives from the Act, which had been approved through the process of bicameral agreement and presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.637" offset="7875700">The procedures of Section 244 preserve the balance among the three participants in the legislative process, the two houses and the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.693" offset="7915928">Each must concur in the form established by the statute for there to be a change in the legal status of an alien from deportable to lawful resident.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Davidson</label>
            <text syncTime="1965.704" offset="7991997">The executive precedes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.206" offset="7998057">This is an arrangement which changes the order of decision but preserves the role of each branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.552" offset="8027419">The legal status of a deportable alien may not be changed unless the executive initiates the request to the Congress and unless the two houses, through the mode of acquiescence or, in the case of criminal aliens, through a positive resolution of approval, concur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.872" offset="8092725">And in fact, that was one of the purposes of the statute in 1939 and '40, which was to take the burden from the alien of initiating private relief procedures by finding a member who would introduce a bill and conferring that burden on first the Department of Labor and then the Attorney General to screen, to recommend, while leaving effective control in the Congress to determine whether the law may be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.063" offset="8213411">And that's a significant element of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.543" offset="8227412">We're not talking about the creation of new rights through the process of resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.387" offset="8250713">We are talking about the suspension of existing mandates of the Congress to deport individuals who meet certain standards or who fail to meet them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.015" offset="8301286">And in order to give that individual a new status, the status of a permanent resident with eligibility for citizenship, it was determined fundamentally important that all participants in the legislative process take part, even though the order of consideration would change, the initiative would come from the executive and consideration then be had by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.572" offset="8399507">The concurrence by the Congress in the grant of permanent residence to a deportable alien only confirms the view of the executive that permanent residence should be granted, and is of course totally beneficial to the aliens whose status is changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.312" offset="8458439">And therefore, even if questions may be asked about legislative review in other contexts, there is no one before the Court who may claim to be injured by the procedures for granting permanent residence through Section 244.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.642" offset="8523745">I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="2106.108" offset="8553629">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.299" offset="8570348">The power to legislate is the power to make law, to change people's rights and obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.036" offset="8609322">It is the most important power of government and in the view of those who wrote the Constitution it has the greatest potential for abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.673" offset="8639833">The Constitution is unusually explicit concerning how this legislating power, this power to make laws, is to be accomplished: either passage by both houses of Congress and presentation to the President for his approval or, in the event of veto by the President, passage by two-thirds of both houses of Congress over his veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.923" offset="8716842">In recent times Congress has invented a device which circumvents these basic constitutional requirements, eliminates the President from his constitutionally guaranteed participation in the lawmaking process, and switches the authority to legislate, to make changes in the legal rights and obligations that people would otherwise have, to Congress acting alone by majority vote or to a single house or committee of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.702" offset="8828020">The legislative veto in this case suffers from the same defect as the legislative veto in any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.947" offset="8852993">Whatever labels one may choose to attach to it, no label can obscure the fact that a legislative veto is something that Congress does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.324" offset="8898446">It is an official governmental act by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.666" offset="8915895">If it is not legislative, if it is, as Mr. Gressman said, non-legislation, then Congress doesn't have the authority to do it, because as this Court made clear in Buckley versus Valeo and Springer versus Philippine Islands, the legislative power is the power to make laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.859" offset="8996666">And if it is legislative in character, then it must comply with the constitutional prerequisites for legislation, passage by two houses and approval by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.706" offset="9036059">Whether it's a legislative no or a legislative yes is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.959" offset="9057061">Congress has in any event made law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.710" offset="9068033">It has affected people's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.013" offset="9077228">Absent what the House did to Mr. Chadha in this case, his status would have been adjusted from deportability to a lawful permanent residence, a very important change, and today he would be a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.320" offset="9126442">It is true, as Mr. Davidson says, that he had no right to have the Attorney General change his status prior to enactment of the original legislation, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.569" offset="9179419">But that legislation made law, made it in the proper way, two-thirds passage over President Truman's veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.244" offset="9210139">That statute gave to the Attorney General the authority to make law as to Mr. Chadha and others like him, and from that point forward he did have the right to have the dispensation that the Attorney General gave to Mr. Chadha and others like him in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.868" offset="9280669">In those few instances in which the Constitution authorizes Congress to act other than through legislation, the textual authorization is explicit and narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.473" offset="9323092">Examples are treaty ratification and appointment confirmation by the Senate and the proposal of constitutional amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.438" offset="9346916">When the framers intended to authorize exceptions, they knew how to do so and they did so in narrow and explicit terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.262" offset="9378263">Other than those exceptions, the authority granted to Congress is, as this Court said in Buckley and Springer, the authority to make laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.807" offset="9404385">Well, what makes you think that you're going to find explicit provision for everything the Congress can do in the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.963" offset="9441061">The President certainly has issued innumerable executive orders since the beginning of the nation and I don't think there's anything in Article I that talks about executive orders... Article II.</text>

          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="2338.107" stopTime="2703.846">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="2338.107" offset="9481603">The difference is, Justice Rehnquist, of course that the Constitution is explicit on this one point, and that is that if Congress is to act other than in a non-legislative fashion, such as dealing with adjournment, ratification of treaties and so forth, it must present its work product to the President for his approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.875" offset="9572718">On one day the framers passed clause 2 of Article I, Section 7, in which they said that all bills must be presented to the President, and then in explicit fear that Congress might be able to act to affect people's rights other than by a bill, they added the next day clause 3 of Article I, Section 7, which expanded that to all orders, votes and resolutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.173" offset="9681910">The Senate also suggests that the legislation requirement was met in this case by the original legislation when the Immigration and Nationality Act first became law in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.849" offset="9728617">This is nothing less than an invitation to rewrite the Constitution in its most fundamental respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.883" offset="9752754">It would mean that Congress, acting all by itself by a two-thirds vote, could remove both the bicameralism and the presentation requirements from all future lawmaking efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.809" offset="9800402">And in fact, this case involves nothing less than that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.794" offset="9824330">If one house of Congress can lawfully change the otherwise applicable law establishing Mr. Chadha's rights as it did in this case, then I know of no intellectually defensible way to distinguish a statute in which Congress makes every action, rulemaking or adjudication, by every department or administrative agency in the Government subject to veto by one or both houses or even one committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.091" offset="9929551">The President would surely veto the original scheme, but by a two-thirds vote overriding that veto Congress could eliminate the President's constitutionally vested power to participate in lawmaking and thereby bring to pass the very result that was the framers' most deeply held separation of powers concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.326" offset="10010531">And from that point on Congress would be home free with a new power not recognized in the Constitution, and all that it took to bring that about is a two-thirds vote by Congress itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.727" offset="10072075">Mr. Gressman refers again to the unique sovereign power vested exclusively in Congress to deal with aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.812" offset="10104467">The Constitution does in fact grant broad power over matters of alienage, but it is not a power that belongs to Congress alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.955" offset="10141038">When this Court ruled in our favor in the Placencia case just a few weeks ago, it was dealing with a statute that was enacted by the legislative process: both houses of Congress with the approval of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.736" offset="10196104">The power to deal with aliens is a power, therefore, that belongs to a majority of both houses with the concurrence of the President or to a two-thirds majority of both houses acting together, following the President's disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.574" offset="10251484">And for the same reason, the necessary and proper clause gives by its own terms the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.982" offset="10293071">We deal here with constitutional commands which are unusually explicit and concerning whose purposes the framers left no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.987" offset="10333091">No. 73 of the Federalist Papers referred to the propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon and absorb the powers of the other departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.534" offset="10363288">And this Court in Buckley versus Valeo observed, quoting from... excuse me... observed that the debates of the Constitutional Convention and the Federalist Papers are replete with expressions of fear that the legislative branch of the national government will aggrandize itself at the expense of the other two branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.134" offset="10429744">That is a correct statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.755" offset="10436222">Anyone who reads those debates and the Federalist Papers comes away with the unmistakable conclusion that there was no concern that more dominated the debates of that summer of 1787 and the period of passage and ratification between 1787 and 1789 than that which Justice White characterized in his separate opinion in Buckley versus Valeo as an overweening Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.107" offset="10565580">And it is equally clear what the framers did in response to that concern, that with specific regard to that very concern they built into the Constitution two requirements: the first, that laws be passed by two separate houses of Congress; and second, that any Congressional attempt to make law, to change people's rights and obligations, must be presented to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.204" offset="10678011">Let me say just a brief word about separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.947" offset="10692953">The Immigration and Nationality Act is a massively complex Act, with literally hundreds of provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.141" offset="10721793">Congress assigned the responsibility of carrying out most of those provisions to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.787" offset="10744362">But in the case of Section 244(c)(2) it assigned the enforcement job to itself, acting through either House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.360" offset="10774664">The fact that Congressional law enforcement occurs only after executive enforcement, and then only in the event that either house disagrees with the executive, helps not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.345" offset="10814580">It lies outside the power of Congress to say, we will wait and see how you execute this law we have passed and if we don't like the way you have done it we will take over the job ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.275" offset="10866302">Congress has also squarely usurped the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.699" offset="10883961">In this very case, Congressman Eilberg explained the reason for this particular veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.862" offset="10904650">It was that Chadha and five others</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.592" offset="10911546">"did not meet the statutory requirements. "</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="2917.337" offset="11798560">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.620" offset="11807651">In defending against the presentation clause and separation of powers arguments made by Respondents here, the Senate and House argue most clearly perhaps in the House of Representatives supplemental brief that what is at issue here is the power of Congress over aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.630" offset="11875673">We submit that that is no more true here than was the question of the power of Congress over elections at issue in Buckley against Valeo, or the power of Congress over bankruptcy at issue last term in the Marathon Pipeline case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.831" offset="11932516">The question is not, we submit, what is the power of Congress, but by what means must Congress exercise that power over aliens in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.207" offset="11973998">Any time it wants, Congress, that is two houses and the President concurring together, can change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.123" offset="12009734">They can eliminate Section 244 entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.876" offset="12024676">They can make us go back to the days of private bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.360" offset="12042648">They can import new standards of flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.020" offset="12053306">They can have more or less of it as Congress chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.743" offset="12068144">What Congress cannot do, what the Constitution forbids it from doing, is to delegate to one house of Congress the power to make those changes in the law and to perform those functions regarding aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.442" offset="12130942">Now, Congress tries to avoid this argument and by avoiding the argument of the requirements of Article I by saying that we don't have action by Congress here and that all that happened was that the Attorney General had made a recommendation to Congress and that recommendation failed passage in the House of Representatives, and therefore like so many other recommendations that fail it does not implicate the requirements of Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.073" offset="12257479">The difficulty with that argument is that it neither comports with the operation of Section 244 nor does it deal with or fit in with our constitutional requirements under Article I for lawmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.114" offset="12313695">This is best illustrated, I suggest, by examining the entire matter that was before Congress in 1975 when Mr. Chadha and five others were vetoed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.139" offset="12353714">340 aliens had the Attorney General's approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.862" offset="12368656">Only six, Mr. Chadha among them, were disapproved by House Resolution 926.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.167" offset="12393838">Viewed alone, that might be seen simply as saying that they failed of approval like other recommendations failed of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.282" offset="12426335">This, however, doesn't account for the fact that 334 other aliens who were sent up in the same general time frame as Mr. Chadha became three days later than the House Resolution 926 was passed entitled to have their status adjusted, simply because of the passage of time and the fact that no resolution of disapproval had been introduced in either house for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.768" offset="12532287">So that we have a situation in which 334 aliens had their status adjusted, according to the Senate and the House, by the passage of time and acquiescence by silence, and Mr. Chadha and five other unfortunate aliens had their status referred back to deportability by the action of a single house of Congress.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3120.961" stopTime="3125.035">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3120.961" offset="12613058">Would you say that that silence equated to non-legislation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_morrison" startTime="3125.035" stopTime="3396.252">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Morrison</label>
            <text syncTime="3125.035" offset="12629358">Well, I have trouble with the non-legislation versus legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.229" offset="12646077">It seems to me that what silence means is much more clearly in terms of it defining what the action meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.751" offset="12672199">That is, that the action was adverse action to Mr. Chadha and five others and it wasn't simply the failure of recommendation, because silence under our Constitution, Article I, Section 7, does not enable a law to be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.391" offset="12726743">Laws are passed by two houses of Congress with the concurrence of the President or a two-thirds vote overriding his veto, and that is not what happened with respect to any of the 334 aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.999" offset="12777211">Therefore, I conclude that the description as mere failure of approval of Mr. Chadha and five others is wholly inaccurate, as it would be inaccurate and unconstitutional to say that the other 334 could have successfully had their status changed simply by the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.311" offset="12854429">In fact, of course in this case the reason that Mr. Chadha's status was adjusted was because of the veto, and this veto is not something that's authorized by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.208" offset="12898002">Ours is a system of limited powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.711" offset="12912003">The framers did not provide for one-house vetoes over aliens, although they did provide for two one-house vetoes in the Constitution itself, both of them by the Senate, over the power of the President to make treaties and the President's powers of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.352" offset="12974593">Those are explicit one-house vetoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.783" offset="12984310">They're contained in the Constitution, and their absence here makes it more compelling that the Court should not imply that Congress is authorized through one house to veto actions of the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.360" offset="13030599">It is for this reason that we contend that the action by the House of Representatives here is unauthorized under the Constitution and hence is not proper within the meaning of the necessary and proper clause so heavily relied upon by the House and Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.042" offset="13093397">In defining the scope of the term "proper" in the necessary and proper clause, this Court in Marbury versus Madison required that the legislation be both necessary and proper and, in terms of propriety, that it meet both the letter and spirit of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.122" offset="13169675">Not only does this veto run contrary to the specific requirements of the Constitution, but it also violates its spirit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.128" offset="13205724">The veto here is nothing more than a legislative shortcut, and because of the legislative shortcut it eliminates the role of the President and the other house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.965" offset="13245012">But it also runs counter to the entire process by which we... the framers established our lawmaking, under which deliberation was the keynote, and the precipitous action by a single house prevented... would not comport with the need to have well-considered deliberative decisions made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.881" offset="13332679">This point about the need for deliberative decisions relates to another point I want to make, and that is that although the activities here are portrayed as an interbranch struggle, this case illustrates that the lives of individuals are very much at stake in controversies such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.312" offset="13406449">That is, that the legislative veto is more than a battle between the President and the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.666" offset="13431840">Similarly, our constitutional system was established not simply to have a bicameral system with each house being individually represented and the President assured of a role as a means of satisfying three separate power blocs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.978" offset="13497146">It was not given to do the lawmaking in order to assure that each had a share of the legislative pie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.190" offset="13525985">The framers were concerned with the avoidance of unwise, oppressive, discriminatory or hasty legislation, and in order to do that they established procedures with sufficient checks and balances built into them to make it far more difficult for Congress to act in a precipitous manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.723" offset="13604039">And it is these institutional checks against unwarranted and unwise action, as much as the formal requirements of the Constitution, that the veto transgresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.441" offset="13646984">This case is a perfect example of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.962" offset="13657015">The Attorney General, after carefully considering the facts of this case, the statutes, the precedents, concluded in a formal proceeding that Mr. Chadha was entitled to an adjustment of status and to remain in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.105" offset="13729636">I believe it is a power to carry out the laws and to administer the laws, an executive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.059" offset="13753460">I believe that the violation here can very well be seen as either lawmaking by the Congress through the House of Representatives or it can be viewed as improper interference with the executive carrying out of the function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.506" offset="13807167">In the Senate supplemental brief they make four separate references to this desire to share the responsibility for carrying out the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.033" offset="13837365">That is precisely what the Constitution forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.603" offset="13851575">So if you view what the House did as lawmaking, it runs afoul of Article I, Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.687" offset="13875922">On the other hand, if you view it as sharing the responsibility, it runs afoul of the separation of powers principles which are throughout our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.524" offset="13915314">Congress makes the law; it does not carry out the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.707" offset="13928062">Finally, to the extent that you could view what Congress did here... and in part because of the very hasty proceedings and the rather cryptic remarks by Congressman Eilberg, it's impossible to tell precisely what was in the minds of even Congressman Eilberg, let alone the rest of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.927" offset="13996921">If you view that as an action in which they were judging, as Article III judges would judge, whether the Attorney General had complied with the statute, then once again the Congress is performing a judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.079" offset="14061495">It is not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, so much as though they are interfering with any Article III judge, but that members of Congress would be performing a function which our Constitution has reserved for Article III judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.468" offset="14111024">The point is important because it gets out of the conundrum of trying to figure out how to label the action of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.741" offset="14140176">In our view, it doesn't make any difference what the House of Representatives was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.514" offset="14159298">If it was engaging in judicial activities or executive activities, then it runs afoul of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.309" offset="14186465">On the other hand, if it was engaged in legislative activities it failed to meet the requirements of Article I, Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.613" offset="14219693">So that viewed in any of these ways the legislative veto is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.827" offset="14236516">Indeed, it makes it clear that it's improper whether or not the agency performing the function being vetoed was an executive agency or an independent regulatory commission, as it is in the two other cases that are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.617" offset="14287611">Similarly, it makes no difference whether the activity was adjudication, either formal or informal adjudication, or whether it was rulemaking, formal or informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.763" offset="14332228">The focus in the challenge here and in the other cases is on the legality of what the House of Representatives or the two houses of Congress acting without the President did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.079" offset="14373502">It makes no difference what the particular activity that the executive performed was, because we are questioning here the legality of what the Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.835" offset="14408506">And for that reason, a decision here would carry with it a decision that all of the vetoes are unconstitutional for the same analytical reasons that we've suggested here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.934" offset="14460960">And it is for that reason that we say that the attempt to postpone the decision is not, an attempt to postpone the decision on this case, is one that ought to be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.351" offset="14506622">This case presents precisely what is wrong with the veto... a Congressional interference in a non-lawmaking capacity with what the executive branch has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.747" offset="14548209">And for that reason, under either of the three analyses I've set forth the veto is unconstitutional and should be set aside.</text>
