            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.764" offset="108466">This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.208" offset="130200">It involves the validity of a regulation at the University of Missouri at Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.495" offset="159353">The University provides facilities for all student groups that wish to meet on its campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.152" offset="189969">More than a hundred such groups, including a religious group, called Cornerstone, were officially recognized by the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.323" offset="234690">The Cornerstone group was informed that it could no longer meet in University buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.705" offset="264156">The exclusion was based on a regulation that prohibited the use of its buildings or grounds for purposes of religious worship or religious teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.183" offset="314102">This suit was instituted by members of the Cornerstone group.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.610" offset="335836">They allege a violation of their rights to free exercise of religion and freedom of speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.830" offset="388708">The University defended on the ground that use of its facilities for religious worship or discussion would offend the Establishment Clause of the Constitution as well as the Missouri Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.210" offset="458194">The District Court dismissed the suit agreeing with the University's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.046" offset="481600">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.726" offset="492257">In our opinion today, we agree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.330" offset="510752">We hold that religious worship and discussion are forms of speech and association protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.596" offset="547742">A state university's regulation of speech must be content neutral absolutely showing of a compelling state interest that justifies discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.865" offset="600822">And the University policy of neutrality as to the content of speech does not sponsor religion any more than the speech of other student groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.327" offset="650664">A University's mission is education.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.392" offset="662994">Our decision today is entirely consistent with the authority of a University to impose reasonable regulations compatible with that mission upon the use of its campus and facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.752" offset="724434">In this case however, the University created a public forum from which only religious groups were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.646" offset="763931">The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.169" offset="778037">Justice Stevens has filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.545" offset="799562">Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
