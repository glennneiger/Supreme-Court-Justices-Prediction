            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="77439">The other case 80-990, Cabell against Chavez-Salido is here on appeal for the United States District Court for the Central District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.820" offset="120698">The case arose because under California law, residents are disqualified from being peace officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.182" offset="146089">Petitioners sought to become a probation officer and brought this case when he was rejected because he was not a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.354" offset="182765">The District Court held that the United States constitution required California to hire aliens as well citizens to enforce its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.805" offset="232606">We noted probable jurisdiction and now reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.897" offset="244936">Under our prior cases, the state may require citizenship as a prerequisite to holding state elective office as well as important non-elective positions in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.258" offset="298435">We have held the school teachers are in this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.467" offset="307212">We now hold that non-citizens maybe excluded form those positions, the occupants of which symbolize and exercise the sovereign’s coercive powers over its citizens and others within its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.216" offset="354232">Probation officers are in this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.604" offset="363846">We have filed an opinion to this effect. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion which he will announce.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="79.441" stopTime="454.260">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="79.441" offset="395192">As Justice White has indicated, I have filed a dissenting opinion and joined in it by Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall and Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.684" offset="440123">The appellees here are three, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.366" offset="454856">Each of them is an American educated, Spanish speaking lawful resident of Los Angeles County, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.062" offset="493622">Each of them holds a college degree from an American university and one of them holds a Master's degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.459" offset="535209">Seven years ago, each had a modest aspiration to become a Los Angeles County deputy probation officer Spanish speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.361" offset="582856">Each was willing to swear loyalty to the State of California and to the United States government and indeed one of them declared his intent to become a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.603" offset="623816">By competitive examination, two of them and possibly the third clearly demonstrated their fitness for the jobs they desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.082" offset="661746">But the appellants denied them those jobs solely, solely because they were not United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.191" offset="698108">The court today concludes that the appellees exclusion from their chosen profession is what it calls a necessary consequence of the community’s process of political self-definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.186" offset="758086">The Court reaches this conclusion in my view by misstating the standard of review it has long applied to alienage classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.359" offset="794866">It then asserts that a lawfully admitted permanent resident alien is disabled from serving as a deputy probation officer because that job, says the Court, “Goes to the heart of representative government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="196.600" offset="863829">In my view, this decision rewrites the Court’s precedents, it ignores history, it defies common sense and it reinstates the deadening mantle of state parochialism in public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.747" offset="924329">Since the case called Yick Wo versus Hopkins in 1886, 95 years ago, this Court has recognized and honored the right of a lawfully admitted permanent resident alien to work for living in the common occupations of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.203" offset="1002174">In Sugarman against Dougall decided in 1973, the Court by an eight-to-one vote expressly refused to exempt public employment positions from that general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.575" offset="1063718">In that case, we struck down as facially inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause a New York statute that excluded lawfully admitted aliens from all state civil service jobs offered on the basis of competitive examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.564" offset="1135607">Sugarman directed that permanent resident aliens may not be barred as a class from the common public occupations of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.645" offset="1180015">Since that case, this Court has consistently held that in each case where the state chooses to discriminate against permanent resident aliens the governmental interest claim to justify the discrimination is to be carefully examined in order to determine whether that interest is legitimate and whether it is substantial, an inquiry must be made whether the means adopted to achieve the goal are necessary and precisely drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.000" offset="1309374">Alienage classifications by a state that do not withstand this stringent examination cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.075" offset="1341661">And applying that stringent standard here, I would hold that on its face the California statue violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.535" offset="1383561">When appellees first sought their jobs, the peace office category in California encompassed more than 70 public occupations including such apparently unrelated positions as toll takers and cemetery sextons and fishing game wardens, and furniture and bedding inspectors, and voluntary fire wardens and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.215" offset="1478229">And to this day, the legislature has offered no reason why such divergent classes of public jobs were gathered under the peace officer umbrella.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.319" offset="1518667">The history of the statute suggest the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.763" offset="1532459">Before 1961, California did not require any of its peace officers to be citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.409" offset="1563075">Indeed in 1851, it granted only Sherifs and policemen and marshals and constables statutory peace officer status, and for more than a century the state did not require even those four occupations to be citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.733" offset="1636322">In 1961, without stating any rationale as the court below called it in one fell swoop, the legislature passed the statute in question which applied the mandatory citizen requirement to all of the positions on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.535" offset="1707480">It made no attempt to include in a peace officer list all positions for which citizenship arguably might be relevant or to exclude all positions for plainly it would be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.437" offset="1767143">Nine years after the statute was enacted, California’s own Attorney General stated that in our opinion the citizenship requirement can no longer validly be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.471" offset="1819284">And today even without a glance at this history, the Court reverses the reasoning that the District Court improperly applied the standard of review far stricter than that approved in Sugarman and later cases.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="454.260" offset="1894412">Thank you, Mr. --</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="454.651" stopTime="702.573">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="454.651" offset="1895979">As originally understood, the Sugarman exception was exceedingly narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.886" offset="1920952">Less demanding scrutiny was deemed appropriate only for statutes deriving from a state's historical power to exclude aliens from participation in its dramatic democratic political institutions or its constitutional responsibility for the establishment and operation of its government.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.013" offset="2009455">California's inflexible exclusion of aliens from deputy probation officer is inconsistent with its tolerance of aliens and other rules integral to the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.018" offset="2069432">California counties apparently may appoint aliens to the position of chief juvenile probation officer or chief adult probation officer if the best interest of the county will be served, and furthermore even before this Court decided In re Griffiths where we held that citizenship could not be imposed as a barrier to the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.703" offset="2176221">The California Court had held that lawfully resident aliens may not be barred constitutionally from the practice of law and nor are they barred from becoming California Superior Court Judges, or Supreme Court justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.533" offset="2239542">And thus a criminal defendant in California may be represented at trial and on appeal by an alien attorney may have this case tried before an alien judge and appealed to an alien justice and then have his probations supervised by a county probation officer headed by an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.439" offset="2323134">I find constitutionally absurd the Court suggestion that the same defendant cannot be entrusted to the supervised discretion of a resident alien deputy probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.011" offset="2377468">In the Court's own words, a statutory scheme that tolerates such a result is sufficiently haphazard as to belie the state's claim that is only attempting to ensure that an important function of government be in the hands of those having the fundamental legal bond of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.756" offset="2464404">In the end, the state has identified no characteristic of permanent resident aliens as a class which disenables them from performing the job of deputy probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.136" offset="2517903">The state does not dispute that these appellees possessed the qualifications and educational background to perform the duty the job entails.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.482" offset="2555310">It advances no rational reason why these appellees native Spanish speakers would graduate academic degrees are not superbly qualified to act as probation officers for Spanish speaking probationers, some of whom themselves may not be citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.726" offset="2624273">I can only conclude that California's exclusion of these appellees from the position of deputy probation officer stems solely from state parochialism and hostility toward foreigners who have come to this country lawfully and who reside here legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.578" offset="2699715">I find it ironic that the court invokes the principle of democratic self-government to exclude from the law enforcement process individuals who have not only resided here lawfully, but who now desire merely to help the state enforce its law.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.204" offset="2766170">In theory, we welcome these lawfully resident aliens to our midst. But despite that theory, the state denies and this Court now approves the right to earn a living in a public job that has little to do with the formulation of policy and political self-definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.486" offset="2863346">As I've stated Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens joined in this dissent.</text>
