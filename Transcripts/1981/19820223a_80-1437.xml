            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="77.333" offset="386090">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="83.587" offset="411063">This case is here on Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.724" offset="435618">The issue in this case is where a former employee of a military exchange who was appointed to his position and subsequently discharged may sue for money damages under the Tucker Act based upon an alleged contract, the existence of which is inferred solely from personnel regulations in effect at the time of his separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.506" offset="526733">The basic facts in this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.558" offset="542929">In 1962 the respondent, Arthur Sheehan, was appointed to a position with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, an instrumentality of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.283" offset="585874">The regulations governing Mr. Sheehan's employment by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, AAFES as it is called, were the very same regulations considered by this Court in United States versus Hopkins in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.725" offset="651598">In 1967, five years after his initial employment, Mr. Sheehan was designated by the Commander of AAFES for participation in a special program for AAFES executives, called the Executive Management Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.718" offset="711576">Under that program, he obtained certain special benefits, but also incurred certain special obligations; principally, the possibility of transfer to any AAFES facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.026" offset="756820">He was required to sign a written acknowledgement of the special conditions of Executive Management Program participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.299" offset="789943">By 1975, the respondent had achieved an AAFES rank equivalent to a Lieutenant Colonel.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.720" offset="819618">In November of that year he was arrested on drug charges and subsequently pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.041" offset="844904">The Service then began administrative proceedings which resulted in his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.277" offset="865907">He appealed the discharge but the appellate authority, the Commander of AAFES, denied the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.597" offset="891089">Mr. Sheehan then sought reconsideration claiming that he had been denied a fair appeal because the Commander of AAFES who acted as the appellate authority had given prior approval for the initial discharge notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.674" offset="943438">As a result of that complaint, Mr. Sheehas was, in effect, granted a new appeal to the next higher authority in the Service, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of AAFES.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.731" offset="987638">His appeal, however, was once again denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.933" offset="1000490">In the meantime, he had initiated suit in the Northern District of Texas seeking reinstatement as well as compensatory and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.056" offset="1040927">He claimed that AAFES had violated its own regulations because of the dual role played by the Commander.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.626" offset="1067259">He also claimed that his discharge was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, unwarranted by the facts and in violation of various, unspecified statutory and constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.953" offset="1120549">Notably, his complaint did not allege that he had ever been employed pursuant to any contract with AAFES, whether express or implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.225" offset="1157642">He invoked the court's jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and various other statutes not now at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.062" offset="1185019">The Service moved to dismiss his complaint noting that he had been an appointed, non-contract employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.068" offset="1213022">In response, he did not seek to amend his complaint to allege the existence of a contractual relationship, nor did he adduce any proof whatsoever that he had ever been employed pursuant to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.209" offset="1265580">The district court granted the motion to dismiss but the court of appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.613" offset="1287210">The court held that jurisdiction existed with respect to his claims for monetary relief under the Tucker Act because AAFES personnel regulations in effect at the time of his discharge were by themselves sufficient to give rise to what the court called a collateral implied-in-fact contract between the Service and respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.712" offset="1375608">The court also held that there was jurisdiction with respect to his claims for non-monetary relief, but that question is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.632" offset="1407269">In our view, the decision of the court of appeals with respect to respondent's claims for monetary relief is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.572" offset="1439033">It is inconsistent with this Court's decisions in Hopkins and Testan.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.790" offset="1455856">It is a patent attempt to circumvent the decision of Congress excluding employees of AAFES and the military exchanges from the coverage of the Back Pay Act, which is, of course, the provision of federal law providing a waiver of sovereign immunity for back pay claims by regular federal officials... federal employees, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.555" offset="1543001">The decision of the court of appeals is also contrary to basic principles of contract law, and if the court's reasoning were widely accepted it would have far-reaching and clearly unacceptable consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.863" offset="1592216">The basic principles governing this case are well-established and I don't believe they are disputed by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.035" offset="1624921">The United States is immune from suit unless Congress consents.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.987" offset="1640699">A waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressed rather than implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.972" offset="1656686">Therefore, a valid waiver may be found only in a constitutional provision, statute or valid regulation that confers the substantive right to recover money damages from the United States, or in a lawful contract, obligating the United States to pay money.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="411.501" stopTime="416.738">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="411.501" offset="1722723">What theory do you think... which of those two do you think the court of appeals proceeded on here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="416.738" stopTime="855.671">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="416.738" offset="1743726">I think the court clearly proceeded on the contract theory, although it relied purely upon regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.459" offset="1766609">It did so because the regulations at issue do not create the right to recover money damages in court, nor do the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.147" offset="1801300">And the statutes and regulations involved are the very ones that were before this Court in Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.299" offset="1821989">And in that case, they were not found to supply a waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.770" offset="1839856">So, the court was relegated to the contract theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.789" offset="1851873">But in finding the existence of a contract, it relied solely on regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.026" offset="1872875">And for that reason, we think the court was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.543" offset="1882906">The decision in this case, though, as Justice Rehnquist's question points out, is whether or not Mr. Sheehan was ever employed pursuant to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.701" offset="1927523">And as I said, the court of appeals found what it termed a collateral implied-in-fact contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.521" offset="1950824">But that simply cannot be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.956" offset="1960542">First, it is squarely inconsistent with Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.158" offset="1973394">In Hopkins, as here, an employee of AAFES brought suit under the Tucker Act for money damages, claiming among other things that his discharge violated AAFES regulations and the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.982" offset="2028669">This Court carefully analyzed the regulations governing employment by AAFES and concluded not that all AAFES employees work under a collateral implied-in-fact contract; on the contrary, the Court concluded that most AAFES employees... in fact, almost all AAFES employees... are appointed to their positions, just like regular federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.764" offset="2119784">Thus, Hopkins cannot be reconciled with the court of appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.066" offset="2137025">The court of appeals' decision is also inconsistent with AAFES' own regulations, even though the court relied solely on those regulations in reaching its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.191" offset="2177463">AAFES' regulations... again, as noted in Hopkins, expressly prohibit the Service from entering into an employment contract with one of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.663" offset="2215393">Yet, the court of appeals' theory was that even if the commencement of Mr. Sheehan's employment was pursuant to appointment, he subsequently or simultaneously entered into a collateral implied-in-fact contract embodying AAFES discharge regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.807" offset="2291984">That simply can't be squared with the AAFES regulations as interpreted in Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.211" offset="2313613">Third, the court of appeals' decision is contrary to elementary principles of contract law.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.715" offset="2343602">The court purported to find the existence of a contract implied in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.269" offset="2361783">But it is clear that the obligation it identified was, at best, a contract implied in law, or a quasi-contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.542" offset="2394906">A contract implied in fact is, of course, a real contract; it is an agreement between the parties, it is based upon a meeting of the minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.481" offset="2430642">It differs from other contracts only in that its existence is inferred from the parties' conduct rather than being expressed in words.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.769" offset="2471811">A contract implied in law, on the other hand, is not a true agreement between the parties; it is merely a legal obligation imposed by a court for the purpose of doing justice, and without reference to the parties' intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.679" offset="2527504">Here, the court of appeals purported to find a contract implied in fact, but looked to no facts particular to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.602" offset="2559164">It looked solely to provisions of law, AAFES' regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.254" offset="2577763">The court did not look to anything the parties had said or done or thought in 1962 when Mr. Sheehan became an AAFES employee, or in 1967 when he entered this Executive Management Program, or at anytime during his 14 years' tenure with the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.715" offset="2647562">And in fact, there were no facts, there are no facts, concerning any of those matters in the record because Mr. Sheehan failed to allege or even to attempt to prove the existence of a contract when this case was in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.292" offset="2701897">Thus, since the court of appeals looked solely to provisions of law and not to any facts particular to this case, it must follow that the obligation it identified was a contract implied in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.016" offset="2752784">And there is no Tucker Act jurisdiction for such obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.485" offset="2766681">Fourth, the implications of the court of appeals' decision are far-reaching, and would clearly be unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.057" offset="2796983">Because the court looked solely to the existence of personnel regulations in effect at the time of Mr. Sheehan's employment and discharge, I think it is fair to say that the court of appeals' decision stands for the proposition that the mere existence of personnel regulations at the time of a government employee's appointment or during his tenure is sufficient to give rise to a contractual relationship between the employee and his governmental employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.827" offset="2912026">There is nothing in the court of appeals' decision confining its logic to Mr. Sheehan's case, as opposed to that of any other AAFES employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.865" offset="2952255">There is nothing in the decision confining its reasoning to regulations concerning discharge procedures, as opposed to any other personnel regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.090" offset="2997081">There is nothing in the opinion confining its reasoning to AAFES or the military exchanges or the non-appropriated fund instrumentalities as opposed to any federal department or agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.098" offset="3053192">And thus, under the court of appeals' logic, whenever any federal employee believes that any federal personnel regulation has been violated, he or she may bring suit for damages under the Tucker Act, claiming a violation of a so-called collateral implied-in-fact contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.627" offset="3127275">That result, of course, would be inconsistent with Hopkins, it would be inconsistent with Testan, it would render the Back Pay Act superfluous, and it would eliminate large chunks of the federal government's sovereign immunity without Congress' consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.821" offset="3187984">Mr. Sheehan's briefs, I believe, ask this Court to affirm the decision of the court of appeals on alternative grounds, if the Court concludes that the court of appeals' reasoning was unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.231" offset="3245662">Mr. Sheehan asks this Court to find that he entered into an express or an implied contract when he entered the Executive Management Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.519" offset="3282860">However, as I noted, he failed to allege or even to attempt to prove the existence of this express or implied contract when the case was in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.708" offset="3323611">In addition, AAFES regulations, as I noted, forbid the agency from entering into an employment contract with one of its own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.083" offset="3361123">Now, since executives, senior executives, entering the Executive Management Program are already AAFES employees, it must follow that a contractual relationship is not formed upon entry into that program or the regulation would be routinely violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.010" offset="3424758">Third, it is apparent from the fact of the regulations concerning the Executive Management Program, that a contractual relationship is not created.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.215" offset="3461642">Those regulations specify that one enters the program by nomination, selection and designation rather than through the formation of a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.671" offset="3499468">Mr. Alito, if we were to agree with you, do we have to remand the case so that a hearing can be held on whether there was an appointment or a contract?</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="869.331" offset="3554116">No, I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.514" offset="3558818">It was... the burden was on respondent, who was the plaintiff below, to prove the existence of Tucker Act jurisdiction when the case was in district court, and he simply failed to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.054" offset="3600927">He did not allege that a contract existed, and he did not adduce any facts to prove the existence of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.825" offset="3632065">Now, he argues that a remand should be ordered because one was given in Hopkins, but the situation in Hopkins was significantly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.331" offset="3666024">There, the employee had alleged the existence of a contractual relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.302" offset="3685982">The Court of Claims held that he was a contract employee because under that court's prior precedence, he was not a regular federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.508" offset="3722762">And thus, it held that he was a contract employee almost as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.795" offset="3739899">Hopkins, for that reason, had no occasion to introduce in the court of claims whatever proof he might have had that he was a contract employee, in a more conventional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.017" offset="3784829">And thus, when this Court reversed the Court of Claims and rejected its reasoning that he was a contract employee simply because he was not a regular federal employee, it was appropriate to remand the case to the Court of Claims so that Hopkins could adduce whatever proof he might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.145" offset="3853375">Here, Mr. Sheehand did not allege the existence of a contract, he did not introduce any evidence establishing the existence of a contract, and he had the clear need to do so, to substantiate Tucker Act jurisdiction which was what he claimed in the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.520" offset="4514795">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.841" offset="4532140">The ultimate issue to be decided by this Court is, do the regulations of the Army-Air Force Exchange Service, AAFES, as they apply to the termination of employment of respondent, constitute part of an implied-in-fact contract between AAFES and respondent, to confer jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and a breach of which implied-in-fact contract waives sovereign immunity in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.626" offset="4655229">The allegations in plaintiff's complaint... in the respondent's complaint now... on file is critical to the facts and determinations by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.734" offset="4695667">The respondent alleges that he was first hired in 1962 as a computer programmer; that subsequent, some five years later, he was accepted into a program known as the Executive Management Program, commonly called EMP.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.510" offset="4762749">The EMP program had special benefits and special burdens, and these are all alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.932" offset="4792424">Included within the special benefits are retention priority, longer notice requirements for separation, which is the procedure for termination of employment, greater insurance benefits and supplemental retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.725" offset="4855641">The EMP program also provided for special obligations including the obligation to develop certain abilities, the obligation to accept worldwide transfer, and the obligation to accept terms of fully EMP retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.652" offset="4919380">Respondent was required to and acknowledged these obligations and benefits in writing pursuant to the regulations of AAFES.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.859" offset="4960235">For the next eight years, respondent served as an EMP employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.763" offset="4983850">In late 1975 respondent was arrested off duty, away from the premises of AAFES, for violations of the state drug law, and in early 1976, he pled guilty to four misdemeanors for violations of state drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.494" offset="5062740">As a result, the Commander of AAFES set forth an investigation pursuant to the regulations and pursuant to these very regulations, the Commander gave the respondent advanced notice of separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.019" offset="5124807">An investigation was then commenced, pursuant to the regulations and as required by the regulations, and a final decision to terminate the employment of respondent was reached in April of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.179" offset="5181440">Notice was then given to respondent, pursuant to these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.748" offset="5199726">Respondent contested his termination and appealed it, pursuant to these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.571" offset="5226998">The appeal was then perfected and taken in accordance with the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.806" offset="5248000">A hearing examiner was then appointed pursuant to the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.075" offset="6829035">That in fact, this offer was accepted in three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.629" offset="6847216">It was accepted when he entered into the employment with the understanding that the government would follow its regulations; when he continued his employment after he acknowledged in writing that he understood these regulations; and thirdly, by following the regulations himself in the appellate process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.126" offset="6933211">That all three of these constitute the acceptance of the offer by the government in its regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.129" offset="8385306">It is the position of the respondent that U.S. versus Hopkins is not contrary to the holding of the Fifth Circuit in the case presently before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.354" offset="8434207">In Hopkins, this case granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the Court of Claims decision, the lower case, the lower court in Hopkins, and a recent decision of the Fifth Circuit in Young versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.315" offset="8502021">The conflict resulted in that the Court of Claims in Hopkins had held that the jurisdiction under the Tucker Act was sufficient to hear claims against AAFES by an employer on a breach of the implied contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.408" offset="8562416">Whereas, the Fifth Circuit, in Young versus the United States, had concluded that the Tucker Act did not extend jurisdiction to those particular claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.698" offset="8603585">The Court of Claims in its lower court holding held that, or relied upon its earlier decision of Keetz versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.756" offset="8647784">In Keetz, the Court of Claims had held that AAFES employees were not federal employees, and therefore, did not serve by appointment but served by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.361" offset="8686237">The Keetz decision was a pre-1970 amendment case, and it's interesting to note that in Keetz the United States government was vigorously contending that AAFES employees serve by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.271" offset="8737855">However, after the 1970 amendment, the goverment has taken a contrary position and now argues that he serves by appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.527" offset="8770873">Hopkins could have answered the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.829" offset="8784039">This Court remanded the case for the determination, did Hopkins serve by appointment, or did he serve by a contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.233" offset="8813714">The case was settled prior to the determination by the Court of Claims, and therefore, that question still remains unanswered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.604" offset="8851122">I would submit to this Court that even if Hopkins had been decided that in fact he served by appointment, which I do not and am not willing to concede in my argument today before this Court, but even if it had decided that Hopkins served by appointment, it would not be controlling in this case because in the instant case, Mr. Sheehan, the respondent, was an EMP employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.743" offset="8979749">And if you use the logic of the Hopkins decision, then this court should remand the case for a determination as to whether or not an EMP employee serves by contract or, in fact, is also an appointed employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.687" offset="9047458">I think the language in Hopkins is clear that this Court should not make that decision without, as the court says, a development of a fuller record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.913" offset="10124434">And when the government properly challenged his invocation of Tucker Act jurisdiction, he failed to allege or present in any way whatsoever any facts which would show the existence of a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2595.735" offset="10459638">Principally, the possibility of transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.985" offset="10468728">First of all, simply signing such an acknowledgement is not proof of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.839" offset="10488059">Many other federal employees who certainly do not work under contract are required to sign similar acknowledgements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.162" offset="10517420">Personnel in the military, for example, must sign enlistment papers, and sometimes agree to incur special obligations such as an extended term of enlistment in exchange for special benefits such as a preferred assignment or training.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.088" offset="10577084">The fact that they sign that acknowledgement doesn't mean they have entered into a contract with the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.909" offset="10600385">And second, even if those special conditions of the Executive Management Program were a contract, they have nothing whatsoever to do with respondent's claim that his discharge was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.585" offset="10663079">We would therefore ask the Court to reverse the decision of the court of appeals with respect to respondent's claims for monetary relief.</text>
