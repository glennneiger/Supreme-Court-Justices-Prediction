            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="121705">We will hear arguments next in Connecticut against Teal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.985" offset="141558">Mr. McGovern, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard F. McGovern, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="66.725" offset="388572">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a Title VII disparate impact case dealing with an employee selection process which as a whole had no adverse impact upon the Respondent's protected group, but which contained a component that did.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.837" offset="457013">Now, although eight Respondents are listed in this writ, it concerns really only four, and those are the four black Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.776" offset="492748">All the Respondents in 1978 were welfare eligibility technicians who sought promotion to the rank of welfare eligibility supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.664" offset="536321">This meant competition and a selection process, the first step of which was the taking of a written examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.003" offset="565682">Now, the examination was designed and developed over the preceding year expressly for the selection process by specialists from the Department of Administrative Services Personnel Division working with supervisory personnel in the Department of Income Maintenance, in which agency the Respondents worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.465" offset="639556">The exam was given in December, 1978, to 329 employees of the Department of Income Maintenance, and of that 329, 314 were racially identified, and of that 314, 48 were black and 259 were white, and of the 48 black, 26 passed the examination, for a pass rate of 54.17 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.199" offset="746449">206 white employees passed the examination, for a pass rate of 79.5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.122" offset="778110">The black pass rate was 68 percent of the white pass rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.007" offset="793679">Respondents learned that they had failed this examination on or about March 15th, 1979, and as a result they could not continue on in the selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.398" offset="839236">Now, the process continued as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.950" offset="857418">The Personnel Division took all scores of all passing candidates and listed them on a promotion list by order of rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.924" offset="901303">Each rank corresponded to a particular score on the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.645" offset="924187">Thus, all persons with the highest score were in the first rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.530" offset="939756">All persons with the second highest score were in the second rank.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="206.632" offset="948219">General McGovern, I suppose that that test, however, was an effective barrier to the further progress of those who failed it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_f_mcgovern_jr" startTime="219.207" stopTime="368.988">
            <label>Mr. Bernard F. McGovern, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="219.207" offset="998479">That is correct, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.242" offset="1010600">Now, at this point, the... for each vacancy... excuse me... in the... which an appointing authority, here the Commissioner of Income Maintenance, had to fill, he was entitled to have certified to him five ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.257" offset="1098685">This is called the rule of five.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.526" offset="1107775">For additional vacancy which he had at this particular time, he was entitled to an additional rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.946" offset="1133480">He could select anywhere from among the ranks which were certified to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.582" offset="1151974">Therefore, if there were five vacancies, he could choose any five people from within the nine ranks which had been certified to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.088" offset="1186038">Here we have a somewhat unusual situation, and that is by the time which the promotions were finally made, there were 46 vacancies but only 25 ranks of passing candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.780" offset="1244761">Therefore, the appointing authority had the option of selecting from among all candidates who passed the examination, all 25 ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.386" offset="1283214">As I say, this is unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.655" offset="1288229">The appointing authority, in making his selections, considered not only rank on the list but recommendation of superiors and job evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.177" offset="1326368">However, before these appointments could be made, Respondents sought an injunction in the district court for the District of Connecticut, and as it pertains to this matter here, the black Respondents claimed that their elimination from the process violated Title VII in that there was a disparate impact upon black candidates at the examination stage by virtue of an examination which they allege to be non-job related.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.030" offset="1445800">At this point in time there was a chambers conference, shortly after the injunction had been sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.302" offset="1474848">The Petitioners agreed not to appoint any persons off the list until the case could be heard on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.723" offset="1504523">When nearly a year had passed, and still the case had not been brought to trial, and the exigencies of the department's business necessitated the making of appointments, the Petitioners informed the court that they intended to make appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.649" offset="1564291">The court agreed not to proceed on the temporary injunction motion as long as eight positions were saved for the eight respondents pending the outcome of trial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="368.988" stopTime="393.120">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="368.988" offset="1597623">General McGovern, may I ask you a question?</text>
            <text syncTime="371.857" offset="1609117">You may want to think about it over lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.225" offset="1618521">Supposing the test had different passing scores for blacks and whites, that a black had to get a 75 score and a white could pass with 65, and therefore it was plainly discriminatory, but then when the whole process was completed, why, there was a fair number of blacks and whites hired, as there are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.186" offset="1686440">Would you still apply the bottom line approach?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_f_mcgovern_jr" startTime="393.120" stopTime="400.542">
            <label>Mr. Bernard F. McGovern, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="393.120" offset="1694172">I don't believe the bottom line would apply in that situation, because there the device would be discriminatory on its face.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="400.542" offset="1723847">But the argument here is that the test is not job-related, and is discriminatory, so why is that a different case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_f_mcgovern_jr" startTime="406.096" stopTime="420.540">
            <label>Mr. Bernard F. McGovern, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="406.096" offset="1745999">That is a different case because in this situation, it is not foreseeable to the appointing authority that the test is a vehicle of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.854" offset="1797094">In fact, quite to the contrary--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="420.540" offset="1803782">But your position is that even if it is discriminatory and not job-related, you nevertheless look at the bottom line.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.444" offset="1827396">--It is our position that in a test given... well, maybe... I'll withdraw that.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.013" offset="1853728">First of all, in the situation which you gave, Justice, there, the device would on its face be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.951" offset="1885493">In another situation, if the test were such--</text>

            <text syncTime="445.488" offset="1903569">Well, supposing they remodeled their allegations in this complaint and said, this is clearly not a job-related test.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.125" offset="1922169">It will produce the same kind of results as if you had two different passing scores.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.427" offset="1939409">Would that be enough?</text>

            <text syncTime="454.977" offset="1941604">--Well, I still say that it would be a different device, because there it doesn't matter... when a device is on its face discriminatory, such as in Manhart, then the bottom line makes no difference whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.709" offset="2032510">We, however, are in a different situation in this case, and that is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.137" offset="4994169">Therefore, the problem we have here in a case 18 free of racial animus is, where do we measure discrimination, since discrimination is what Title VII is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.500" offset="5067625">Do we measure it at each step of a multi-component process, or do we measure it at the so-called bottom line?</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.614" offset="5156128">The Court's focal point therefore should be Congress's focal point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.501" offset="5175667">In enacting Title VII, we glean from the decisions of this Court and the legislative history that an overriding concern of Congress in this instance was opening opportunities and skilled positions to blacks and doing away with racial job stratification by eliminating discrimination, not only in intent but in effect, and as this Court in Teamsters pointed out, that it is to be expected that a non-discriminatory environment will result in a work force which mirrors demographically the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.424" offset="5319341">Therefore, Congress was interested in the overall picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.226" offset="5334596">In addition to dealing with individual instances of specific intentional discrimination, Congress was concerned with whether minorities got skilled jobs in sufficient numbers to penetrate the ranks of the skilled work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.252" offset="5398649">It was interested in final employment decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.069" offset="5505960">By the same token, in Espinoza versus Farah, the Court found no Title VII violation because inter alia the employer had hired a large number of the plaintiff's protected group.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.465" offset="5779514">Well, I hope we convince the Court in that respect, but it is our position that in this model of proof the individual's rights are really tied to the group's rights in the sense that in a case such as this, we do not deal with the individual's particular situation other than identifying his protected status, and so we do not know about his education, his background, or any other... how he even came to apply for the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.937" offset="5909395">In this respect, all we know, that if an individual is to succeed in proving a prima facie case of discrimination, that is contingent upon how his group does, and if his group, with respect to the selection process, does not succeed as a group, then he succeeds in proving a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.467" offset="5999569">However, if his group does succeed in the extent that there is no disparate impact against the group, then he fails or does not prove a Title VII violation, and in fact there is none, absent intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.412" offset="6067279">Now, in Dothard, this Court described Griggs and Albemarle as dealing with facially neutral employment standards which disproportionately exclude blacks from employment, and the Court stated that Griggs and Albemarle guided its decision in that case, but in addition, those cases have elements which are not present in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.383" offset="6195174">In addition to containing disparate impact at both the selection level and the component level, these cases contain another element not present in this case, and that is an element of invidiousness, and the Court pointed out in both Griggs and Dothard that Title VII deals with removal of artificial, unnecessary barriers which operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.300" offset="6306874">Now, in Griggs and Albemarle, the status quo of past patterns of discrimination was frozen by diploma and test requirements which had a certifiable, foreseeable effect through demographic statistics on the protected groups, and which also in the case of tests excluded members of an educationally deprived group, blacks in North Carolina, which educational deprivation was directly traceable to race due to education in dejure segregated schools, of which the Court took notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.207" offset="6442502">In Dothard, the height and weight requirements were invidious in the sense that the employer knew or should have known in advance from demographic statistics, could have certified such, that the particular component would have an adverse impact on women, and that component was related to gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.471" offset="6531527">Here there is no invidiousness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.027" offset="10161712">--No, they haven't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.729" offset="10164533">The adoption of a bottom line approach, it is the Respondent's claim, would also be contrary to two fundamental principles of Title VII, the first principle being that the Title VII was enacted to prohibit discrimination against individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.327" offset="10254916">Again, Congress chose the means of prohibiting discrimination against individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.848" offset="10285009">It selected to eliminate or decided to eliminate selection processes that discriminated in effect unless they were shown to be job-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.371" offset="10323148">Respondents aren't here saying that this examination is illegal merely because it had a disproportionate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.577" offset="10359929">They have made the claim that it was not job-related, related to the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.614" offset="10376125">All these individuals, these four Respondents in this case, were serving for up to two years provisionally in the positions at question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.885" offset="10409143">They were serving, as the testimony at trial indicated, successfully in their positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.873" offset="10437147">They were eliminated by this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.242" offset="10446655">It is their claim, and if this Court decides in favor of the Respondents, that issue would have to be addressed whether the exam was job-related or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.115" offset="10490123">Also the claim is made here that this was one step in a multiple component selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.454" offset="10519485">The EEOC has issued questions and answers as a means to attempt to interpret their guidelines, and in one of their questions, Questions 14, it addresses this bottom line approach, and it defines selection process as all the component selection procedures leading to the final employment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.634" offset="10604226">It is the claim of the Respondents in this case that there was only one component leading to the final employment decision or promotional decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.656" offset="10644245">That was the examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.858" offset="10653127">After the examination, the commissioner made selections, discretionary selections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.698" offset="10684474">There was no other component that further screened candidates for qualification for promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.618" offset="10708089">The claim is also made that the bottom line approach satisfies the Congressional purpose of placing more black candidates, black individuals into employment positions, but again, the purpose that this may serve the purpose of Congress as to a group, as to a classification, runs contrary to the idea that Title VII is aimed at the individual, its focus is on the individual, and that that focus on the individual prohibits the treatment of individuals merely as components of a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.093" offset="10870048">The disparate impact analysis is focused upon a device, but the claim is that it discriminates against individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.718" offset="10916546">Disparate impact analysis is a method of an order... it's an order and allocation of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.454" offset="10943504">It's an evidentiary method on addressing the order and allocation of proof in a claim that an employment practice is discriminatory in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.843" offset="10984987">To adopt the position advanced by the Petitioners in this case, this Court would be sanctioning the use of selection or promotional devices that have disproportionate impacts, that do discriminate, and that are not related to business justification, that are not job-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.827" offset="11088954">The touchstone... this Court has said the touchstone of Title VII is business necessity, and that runs throughout the Court's decisions, that if a selection process or a promotional process excludes disproportionately one member... members of a protected group, then that device has to be shown to be job-related, and that teaching was from Griggs right down to Dothard versus Rawlinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.997" offset="11205669">The Court has addressed the bottom line approach in a number of instances, not explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.453" offset="11243494">In Furnco, the Court did say that the bottom line numbers were relevant as to the question of intent in a disparate treatment case, but in New York Transit Authority versus Beazer, dealing with a disparate impact case, although the Court found a weak prima facie case of discrimination, and found that the employment practice was job related, the Court did not rely on the bottom line numbers in that case as dismissing or saying that there was no prima facie violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.109" offset="11382048">Those statistics showed that the employment by the New York Transit Authority, they employed minorities twice as high as their numbers in the relevant labor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.548" offset="11419873">The Court did say in a footnote that that would be relevant to a disparate treatment case where intent was required, where proof of intent was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.337" offset="11458952">I think to adopt the position advanced by the Petitioners in this case would bring the Court close to sanctioning in effect a subjective quota system, in that as long as the bottom line numbers, as long as the numbers match up, irregardless of the legitimacy of the devices screening the candidates, then there would be no violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.608" offset="11580056">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard F. McGovern, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2866.175" offset="11586325">Mr. Chief Justice, I think Mr. Bucci and I can agree on one point, and that is, if there were but one component to this examination process, and if the appointing authority were required to go down the list, one, two, three, four, five, as the examination results ranked the candidates, then there would be a prima facie case, because the examination would in effect be the selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.558" offset="11779841">Here, there was an examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.024" offset="11789767">Candidates were listed in a particular order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.478" offset="11811605">However, the appointing authority was not bound to go down the list, one, two, three, four, five.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.366" offset="11831145">He had other selection devices, and in fact employed them in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.520" offset="11851729">So that we are not here dealing with a simple component selection device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.722" offset="11872523">Further, it was pointed out to the Court that the court of appeals as a general proposition endorsed the bottom line rule, and it said, viewing the overall results of a selection process ordinarily is a prudent course to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.651" offset="11952249">Now, it did draw the line with respect to an identifiable pass-fail barrier and said in that situation a different result would obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.824" offset="11988925">Under the court of appeals rationale, if all persons in the selection process were allowed to continue until the end of the process, and then the exact same selections were made as were made in this process, there would be no disparate impact case, no case for the Respondents under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.439" offset="12075442">However, Furnco and Burdine do not require the employer to use a process which maximizes consideration of minority candidates, nor does it require the best hiring process to be used, and in point of fact, the Court's emphasis on a passing score, some kind of a watershed or great divide is totally illusory, because in this situation particularly, where we have the rule of five, there are many passing points with respect to the selection process, all the way up and down the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.064" offset="12233953">For example, if we had a situation in which a person was in the eleventh rank, and there were but six vacancies, so that the appointing authority was... certified the first ten ranks, if in that situation, a person in the eleventh rank were, say, black, and there were disparate impact from the eleventh rank down, would, under the rationale of the court of appeals, would he be allowed to prove a prima facie case with respect to disparate impact at the eleventh rank, because that to him was a de facto passing score with respect to those particular six jobs, and this could carry up and down the whole process, and we could end up with three or four cases on a particular selection process involving numerous minority groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.234" offset="12458606">Mr. McGovern, the Solicitor General suggests that the burden of proof shifts earlier, once there is an adverse impact shown as to a particular test or portion of the requirements, and that that then shifts the burden to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.083" offset="12545960">Would you like to comment upon that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.916" offset="12557349">Yes, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.985" offset="12561633">We disagree with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.987" offset="12573649">Here we are in a case of establishing a prima facie case, and in a case of non-intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.426" offset="12607400">Therefore, it is our contention that the plaintiffs in that case have the burden of making a prima facie case, and in a situation such as in this selection process, there is no prima facie case, no showing in any sense of discrimination until such time as the plaintiff showed disparate impact with respect to the final employment decisions.</text>
