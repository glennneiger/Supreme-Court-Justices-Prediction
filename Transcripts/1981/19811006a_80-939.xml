            <text syncTime="14.843" offset="191891">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the expenditures provided in the Federal Election Campaign Act for political party committees made in connection with the general election campaigns of candidates of that political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.721" offset="267333">The amount awarded by the statute, allotted by the statute, is two cents per voter; technically, two cents per voter age population, which is the amount that the statute sets for the expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.664" offset="327101">The case arose before the Federal Election Commission on a complaint filed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.503" offset="358552">That complaint challenged the practice of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee and the state party committees of the Republican Party, in which they agreed that the state party committee's allocation under the statute would be expended by the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="80.284" offset="453638">Yes, and the statute makes that very clear, as I think the statutory history will show.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="89.140" offset="489060">The transfer of authority in this case was from the state parties in the individual states of the spending limit of two cents per voter that they would otherwise have for the candidates for the Senate in their state.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="103.365" offset="545903">In that state, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.269" offset="561576">The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee sought the Commission's reversal of an earlier decision for a similar practice in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.076" offset="608805">Complaint before the Commission explicitly asked that that decision be overruled; that the Commission seek injunctions and civil penalties against the practice of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.169" offset="673171">The Commission on July 11, 1980 found no reason to believe that that allegation stated a violation of the act and refused to take action on the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.946" offset="732312">The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee sought review as the statute provides in the District Court for the District of Columbia under the statutory provision 437g(a)(8), which provides that the District Court may review the Commission's action on a complaint and determine whether it was contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.961" offset="820293">The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals; the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the District Court, finding that the statute's manifest purpose banned the practice of these agreements, found that the basis on which the Commission in earlier decisions had established this rule presented a shifting basis, gave no deference to the Commission's interpretation of the statute and ordered that the Commission proceed forthwith under the enforcement responsibilities in the statute, which DSCC had invoked by its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.686" offset="979222">Those enforcement responsibilities are set forth in our brief and I don't intend to go through them in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.573" offset="1002732">They provide for complaints filed, notice to the opposite parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.609" offset="1018928">If the Commission finds reason to believe, investigation, conciliation and eventual results would be that the Commission would find probable cause to believe.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="230.667" offset="1055186">Mr. Steele, when you said that the Court of Appeals found that the Commission had shifted its position, would that be roughly analogous to the NLRB?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_nevett_steele" startTime="243.557" stopTime="263.471">
            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="243.557" offset="1106699">I think that is analogous to the NLRB and other administrative law cases I think was the analogy that they were drawing on.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.044" offset="1136688">We would submit that it is different here in that what the Commission is doing is exercising a prosecutorial authority rather than an adjudicatory authority such as the National Labor Relations Board Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="263.471" stopTime="273.494">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="263.471" offset="1186425">Hasn't this Court recognized the fact that the NLRB may, from time to time, shift its position, and either one may be right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_nevett_steele" startTime="273.494" stopTime="442.852">
            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="273.494" offset="1226445">It certainly has, and I think the cases that we've cited reflect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.629" offset="1242954">The Commission would submit that there was no shifting basis in its approach to these; that indeed, the very fact that the DSCC sought reversal of the decision in MUR 780, as it is noted in the Commission's records, is evidence of the fact that the Commission came to the same results in earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.275" offset="1317560">But I do think that in the cases that you cite, that even if there had been a shift, that that would still be within the discretionary authority of the Commission if it was rationalized and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.231" offset="1357370">But I do think this Court has recognized that... the ability of an administrative agency to re examine its position should not be foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.737" offset="1395405">The case raises issues both procedural and substantive in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.641" offset="1419019">Substantively, the question, which I will address in a moment, is whether the Commission was correct in its interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.163" offset="1449112">I would like for a moment, however, to touch upon the procedural issue because I think the two are intertwined in such a way as to demonstrate the problem that the Commission has in the procedural aspects with the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.404" offset="1502089">The central issue in the case, in a sense, is whether the statute so clearly prohibits the sort of agreement that was entered into here; that it was unwarranted for the FEC not to prosecute the case, not to go forward under the provisions that it has for seeking enforcement of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.186" offset="1589233">The Court of Appeals stated that in its opinion, it was not a discretionary exercise of Commission power that was at issue here, but solely the interpretation of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.727" offset="1639388">And it is precisely on that point that the Commission thinks that the court below erred; erred in relationship to other cases that it has decided with regard to the Federal Election Campaign Act in the Commission's exercise of its enforcement responsibilities, and erred more broadly in the overall context of administrative law.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.939" offset="1712218">Indeed, as we have submitted in our brief, it would seem that the exercise of the prosecutorial power, the power to enforce the statute, is one that throughout the jurisprudence of this country has been seen as a discretionary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.548" offset="1770732">What you have here is the decision by the Commission that it should not go forward in that mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.618" offset="1794974">The decision of the Commission was based on a legal analysis; there was not a factual investigation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.856" offset="1819947">Nonetheless, the decision of the court below suggests that the Commission must go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.343" offset="1845860">Now, as we have said in our brief, the Commission is structured in a way unlike many other commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.264" offset="1869579">It requires... it's a six member body, it requires the positive votes of four members to bring such an action.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="442.852" stopTime="444.752">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="442.852" offset="1903852">What was the vote here?</text>
            <text syncTime="444.152" offset="1909077">Unanimous?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_nevett_steele" startTime="444.752" stopTime="732.915">
            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="444.752" offset="1911480">The vote here was unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.554" offset="1914719">The vote in all three of the earlier decisions which we have referred to in our case, one advisory opinion back in 1976 and in the two enforcement cases in 1978, all of them were unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.362" offset="1965919">They were all six nothing with the exception of one of the two MUR's where there were only five members present, but it was also unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.551" offset="2002699">Those safeguards for the Commission's processes include, as I noted, the four votes required.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.824" offset="2035823">There is, of course, the composition of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.293" offset="2045645">It is balanced so that there can be no vote of four members, by all the members of one party, as the statute prohibits the Commission from having more than three members of any one party.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.135" offset="2109070">With regard to the merits, the Commission submits that its interpretation was not only reasonable, but was really quite consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.741" offset="2147418">I would emphasize, however, that it seems to the Commission that the standard that should be here applied is not whether its interpretation was the only one, but only whether its interpretation in light of the act, the words of the act, the context of the act, was a reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.286" offset="2221605">So, as far as the Commission is concerned, even if the statute is at least ambiguous it should prevail in this case, because the interpretation placed upon it by the court below that required the Commission to go forward was that the statutory mandate was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.366" offset="2297988">The review provision in 437g(8) provides that the Commission's actions will be reviewed to see if they are contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.353" offset="2329857">And the Commission concedes, as I think would be true even without that statute but with the statutory provision there, that obviously any dismissal of a complaint is reviewable by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.411" offset="2370085">The Commission is not contesting that those decisions are not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.696" offset="2383251">The question is what the standard is that would be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.564" offset="2402791">In examining the merits, I would urge upon this Court to note, first of all, that the decision of the Commission and of the District Court in no way increased the limits that the statute provides for the spending in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.741" offset="2459424">441a(d)(A)(3) provides that the national committee of a political party may send two cents per voter age population, and that the state committee may spend two cents per voter age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.184" offset="2521178">That total, four cents for the party, has not been increased by the decision of the commission below.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.607" offset="2550957">What the decision of the commission below said was, that the state party, which has a two cents per voter age population authority for spending under the statute, that the state party could assign that to the National Republican Senatorial Committee; that there was no bar in the statute to that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.770" offset="2635594">The argument of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee accepted by the court below was that the statute, by providing separate limits for the national party and the state party, makes explicit that that limit must be spent by the national committee or must be spent by the state committee, and that there could be no transfer of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.100" offset="2720858">Initially in 1976, when the Democratic National Committee filed a complaint and then withdrew it, there was an advisory opinion by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.871" offset="2764012">The Commission under 437f, 2 USC 437f, is authorized to issue advisory opinions to any person who requests them about specific transactions in which they are engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.529" offset="2814585">In that opinion, the Commission very clearly stated that in its view the National Republic Congressional Committee there, not the senatorial campaign committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.735" offset="2855441">The two committees in question, one for the senatorial side, one for the congressional side, for the House side, are two separate committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.472" offset="2886370">But for purposes of the statute, they are the same because they represent the same interests, one for the Senate side, one for the House side.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.260" offset="2925553">The Commission's decision in AO 1976-108 explicitly stated that under its interpretation of the statute, referred to the legislative history of the 1976 amendments after this Court's decision in Buckley, that the National Republic Congressional Committee was a committee of the National Committee of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.072" offset="3004757">That is to say that it could be... the National Committee could assign to that committee its spending limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.994" offset="3036417">That the National Republic Congressional Committee could spend its funds on a delegation from the Republic National Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="742.705" offset="3103290">My question is this: could everything they attempted to do by agency agreements, they have done under 441a(a)(4) by transfer of funds if the congressional committees are not political committees within a(a)(4)?</text>

            <text syncTime="884.695" offset="3671297">Again, I think that that is our case, and I think you're stating it for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.814" offset="3683731">The argument on the other side, I believe, is that by aggregating these two... the statute 441a(d)(3) provides a two cents for the national committee and a two cents for a state party committee, and that somehow the statute by providing those separate limits, which we agree that that allows the state committee not to transfer that to the national, so that the state committee has the authority to retain that spending power if it wishes, and that there's nothing in the statute... there's no mention in the statute of any prohibition of any arrangement like this, that at the very best the court below had to rely on the inference that by stating the two separate limits, that it meant that there should be no transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.189" offset="3841197">The court below also stated that its belief that the purpose of the statute was to strengthen the state parties... again, even conceding that that's so, which I don't think there's much citation of legislative history to support that, it would seem to us that the statute under the Commission's interpretation allows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.520" offset="3918520">It allows the state, if it wishes to, to retain that spending authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.822" offset="3935761">To turn for just a moment to the Court of Appeals decision below with regard to the question as to the shifting basis, not only would we contend, as I said in response to Justice Rehnquist's question, that even had there been a shift here that it enabled the agency to make that kind of decision and that's one of the purposes of having this kind of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.420" offset="4030219">But we would submit that throughout all three of those decisions, the basic elements which I have set forth in discussing the merits, were there stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.026" offset="4068567">The basic authority that the Commission relied on in all of them, including AO 1976-108, was the transfer authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.882" offset="4100019">The court said that in some of the earlier MUR's the emphasis was on that and on the failure of the statute to explicitly prohibit this kind of transfer, and said that later decisions of the Commission suggested a shifting basis in that we then noted in this MUR in particular that later developments, that the Congress had legislation specifically in front of it... the House of Representatives had legislation specifically in front of it which would have prohibited the transfers proposed by the House Administration Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.686" offset="4227183">There was a rule against that bill going forward, and we set forth in the decision in this case, the administrative decision in this case, MUR 1234 sets forth six or seven quotations from various congressmen, Congressmen Frenzel, Stockman, Conable, Mikva, Davis, both sides of the aisle, that the very purpose of that bill, the reason that they were speaking against it, of the rule to report the bill out, was because it was going to prohibit these kind of transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.968" offset="4328329">And on that basis we would think that the Commission's decision is not only reasonable but is in accord with the legislative history.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jan W. Baran</label>
            <text syncTime="1068.096" offset="4404920">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, petitioner, National Republican Senatorial Committee, a committee of the Republican Party, seeks reversal of the Court of Appeals decision, just as the Federal Election Commission does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.487" offset="4462389">Our essential reason, set forth in our brief, is that the statute in question, which I'll refer to as Subsection (d)(3), simply does not prohibit the conduct that the Democratic Committee is complaining of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.663" offset="4519127">The limits, as Mr. Steele has indicated, have not been exceeded with respect to the total dollar amount, and it was noted so by Judge Wilke in his dissent, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.737" offset="4567401">What is being complained of is a method utilized within the political party for most effectively spending the money on behalf of senatorial candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.945" offset="4608257">And that method, which has been used by the Republican Party in 1978 and in 1980 on occasion and only voluntarily, is for the state committees of the Republican Party to designated the petitioner, NRSC, as an agent for purposes of spending funds on behalf of these candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.708" offset="4699372">The respondent has never in the course of the administrative proceeding or before any of the courts below suggested that the total amount of money spent for any specific Senate candidate in any state has been exceeded by the Republican Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.004" offset="4768544">Unlike the Federal Election Commission, we do address the potential, although we feel unnecessary to reach, constitutional issues that would arise if the Court of Appeals decision were upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.929" offset="4828208">As Judge Wilke noted in his dissent, the interpretation that has been engrafted on this statute by the Court of Appeals would place a restriction in the way of the political party in terms of most effectively supporting its Senate candidates, even though it would be within the statutory limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.660" offset="4907098">Unlike the compelling governmental interest that has been recognized by this Court in Buckley v. Valeo, which is the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption, that interest is not advanced in furtherance of any such restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.039" offset="4972613">The respondent in their briefs suggest solely a government interest in revitalizing the state committees of the political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.894" offset="5016081">The Republican Party is certainly touched by this outpouring of concern on the part of the Democratic Committee for the well being of Republican state committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.100" offset="5060907">It certainly is unprecedented, to say the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.285" offset="5073654">But in terms of actual purpose behind Subsection (d)(3), there is no reflection in the legislative history, as we note in our brief, that there was any intention on the part of Congress when they passed Subsection (d)(3) back in 1974 to limit its benefits solely and narrowly to the state committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.000" offset="5164456">The Congress was concerned with providing a still substantial role in private financing for political parties generally, but certainly not just for the state committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.208" offset="5209282">And furthermore, as noted earlier by Mr. Steele, there are provisions within the statute itself that would indicate that Congress views the parties as basically one large entity and one large organization within the United States for financing purposes, to the point where unlike virtually any other component of campaign financing, any of the committees of the same party can shift unlimited funds back and forth to each other; implicitly recognizing that it's up to the political parties to make a decision on how to best structure their campaign financing within the overall limitations contained in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.570" offset="5382735">For those reasons, as set forth in greater detail in our brief, the petitioner NRSC requests reversal of the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.093" offset="5420874">If there are no questions, I will conclude my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.234" offset="5473432">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, what is striking about the last few minutes of argumentation offered by the FEC and the NRSC is that in construing the plain language of the provision in question, what Mr. Baran referred to as (d)(3), neither side offered any analysis of the plain terms of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.182" offset="5569250">That is until Justice Stevens asked general counsel Steele whether NRSC was a national committee within the meaning of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.871" offset="5611986">General counsel Steele responded that it was, which is a mis analysis of the plain terms of the provision which lies at the heart of the agency's difficulty from the beginning of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.512" offset="5658588">The terms in Section (d)(3), Subsection (d)(3), are not ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.266" offset="5677605">They are separately defined in the definitions provision of the FECA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.320" offset="5701743">The definition about which Justice Stevens inquired, the national committee, is defined under Section 431(14) of the FECA as the organization... that is, one organization... which by virtue of the bylaws of a political party is responsible for the day to day operation of such political party at the national level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.436" offset="5802262">The NRSC is decidedly not the national committee of a political party, It is a sub unit of the national party structure, but the Commission itself has recognize that it is the Republican National Committee, which is not a party to this case, which is the national committee under Subsection (d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.063" offset="5872792">More to the point is the analysis of what state committees are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.781" offset="5895571">Once again, Congress separately defines state committees in the definitions provision of the act, and it is concededly... in fact, conceded by all the parties to this litigation... that NRSC is not a state committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.691" offset="5947294">How is it, then, that the agency has construed this provision, which confers defined limits on specifically defined entities, to allow NRSC not named or referred to in that provision to rest unto itself the limit that Congress has assigned to another?</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.688" offset="6027228">One of the problems in this case has been the agency's inability over a course of decisionmaking to offer a single consistent rationale for overcoming the plain terms of this provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.352" offset="6113850">Because if they're not a national committee within the meaning of 441(a)(d)(3), I take it 441(a)(d)(3) just simply doesn't apply to NRSC.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.290" offset="6149690">That is absolutely correct, Justice Stevens, with one exception I should note here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.194" offset="6173305">And that is that in 1976, the Federal Election Commission promulgated a regulation following oral comment, hearings and submission to Congress subject to the one House veto provision, which purported to allow the national committee, under Subsection (d)(3), to assign its spending rights to any agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.977" offset="6264420">This was the sole exception, as the FEC interpreted it at that time, and as Congress approved it at that time, to the defined limits and defined committees of Subsection (d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.165" offset="6309142">In this litigation, however, for the first time before the Court of Appeals the FEC disavowed its prior interpretation of this regulation and now claims that it has no bearing whatsoever to Subsection (d)(3), but instead applies only to Subsection (d)(2) involving presidential elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.376" offset="6686037">It also draws strength from the point that I just suggested to you, and that is that where Congress did intend party committee limits to be assignable, it expressly stated so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.268" offset="6729609">In Subsection (d)(3), for example, Congress expressly authorizes state committees to assign their limits altogether to, or to share them with, subordinate committees of the state party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.057" offset="6772763">Similarly, NRSC, as a congressional committee, possesses a $17,500 contribution limitation, which it is expressly authorized, again by the FECA, to share with the national committee of a political party, of its party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.133" offset="6828979">So Congress was very clear that if limits were to be assigned, it wished to have the final say so in the matter, and it did not provide for this assignment authority in Subsection (d)(3).</text>

            <text syncTime="2248.679" offset="9127232">That provision, leaving aside its plain terms which do not refer to NRSC, was enacted in 1974, and the legislative history shows that Congress was well aware of the congressional committees in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.271" offset="9189612">In fact, there was pending on the floor of the Senate at that time a proposal to exempt the congressional committees altogether from spending limits, and that proposal was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.912" offset="9240185">In 1976, the question of NRSC spending authority was raised yet again, and this time it was raised through a $17,500 contribution limit, which it shares with the national committee of its party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.755" offset="9303506">But not at that time nor in the years before did Congress elect to confer upon NRSC a share in the state committee's spending authority under Subsection (d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.396" offset="9350108">It was a considered question by Congress, and Congress addressed it forthrightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.716" offset="9371320">Similarly, the transfer provision is no answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.418" offset="9386157">While it is true that funds can be transferred freely between committees, it is also clear from the scheme of the act and its legislative history that party committee limits are not fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.310" offset="9433700">Unless Congress has expressly stated that those limits are to be shared or assigned, and it has in the provisions I cited to Justice Rehnquist, assignability is barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.950" offset="9476332">In the last analysis, the FEC and NRSC in this case have shrugged their shoulders and said what difference does it make; form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.473" offset="9518337">It doesn't matter whether the state committees spend the funds or whether NRSC does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.893" offset="9540071">Respondent submits that the question of form or substance in matters of policy are not for the agency to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.416" offset="9574134">It is for Congress to make policy judgments in the election scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.220" offset="9593361">In any event, the question of form which is before this Court, is decidedly one of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.457" offset="9618334">For in this Subsection (d)(3), as in other provisions of the act which I've cited in the colloquy with Justice Rehnquist, Congress made specific provision for special spending rights by state committees and their subordinate units, and it did so because of a very strongly expressed concern that these committees would not be in a position to maintain their role absent this special provisions of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.906" offset="9720107">The record in this case shows that the congressional concern was by no means unfounded, for uncontroverted in that record is evidence that in 1978 when these state committee NSRC authority assignments were first made, state party committees spent virtually no money under the authority provided under Subsection (d)(3).</text>

            <text syncTime="2438.435" offset="9886245">And certainly, the availability of this assignment authority only makes it easier for state committees to essentially abdicate the role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.089" offset="9916861">It is far easier for a national fund raising base like NRSC to raise the money for congressional elections across the country than for, say, the state committees of Missouri, Kentucky, Iowa and Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.479" offset="9966389">Yet Congress held out to those committees that incentive to do so, to raise the money and then spend it in their own congressional elections, and the assignability of those limits completely contradicts this congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.524" offset="10030546">So it is that the record shows that through this spending pattern, Section 441a(d)(3) has essentially been stood on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.880" offset="10063983">What was intended as an incentive to state and local party organizations has instead been turned into a supplement to national fund raising power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.736" offset="10099405">And as this court noted in Buckley, in an age of media politics, expensive polling techniques and other refined forms of campaigning, money, very expensive money, certainly talks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.043" offset="10152694">And without the special provision made for the state committees, the aggregation of power will be pulled further and further toward the national center of the country, which is a result Congress sought to avoid.</text>
