            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="123172">We will hear arguments next in Foremost Insurance Company against Pansy F. Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.020" offset="155250">Mr. Andrews, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready now.</text>

            <text syncTime="62.505" offset="373112">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.639" offset="389725">The complaint that we have with the lower court opinion in the Fifth Circuit is that it, that court, abandoned any requirement of the commercial connection to either the location of this maritime, or so-called maritime, collision and the activity complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.617" offset="465585">Since this Court's opinion in Executive Jet v. The City of Cleveland, there has been a lot of debate as to just what the Court meant in much of the dicta in that decision in light of the fact that the decision was limited to aircraft crashes on navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.163" offset="539773">I think that there is uniform agreement with the scholars and courts that something beyond the locality alone rule was required or ought to be required, because that locality alone rule does not work so well anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.057" offset="611348">There is two fields of debate as I recognize the issues, as to whether the locality should be abandoned completely and that a maritime nexus alone should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.104" offset="687521">I think that the majority view, certainly the view that I take and I believe the view taken by most scholars, is that locality is still important.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.826" offset="730467">But in addition to locality, there ought to be something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.530" offset="745200">That has been formulated I think as the so-called locality plus rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.949" offset="766934">The plus that I would add to the occurrence is the plus of some commercial flavor to either the location of the wrong or the activities complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.644" offset="833703">The Fifth Circuit, in its early decisions following Executive Jet; notably, Peytavin which involved a collision of automobiles on a floating pontoon portion entrance way to the ferry, found that there was no maritime jurisdiction in that type of action, but I would suggest to you, kept a commercial flavor to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.340" offset="1012485">Rented boats would certainly... this case, what makes this case I think interesting and what makes it here is that we are talking about commercial pleasure boating in the purest sense, as the district court found.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur H. Andrews</label>
            <text syncTime="241.053" offset="1087299">I cannot honestly tell the Court that I can draw the line so fine to say that if I was paddling a boat around, rented, on the Potomac River and it sunk because of some defect in it, that that ought to be maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.979" offset="1147068">My reaction is that it should not be.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="258.313" offset="1156367">How would you help us to define... you asked us to adopt the commercial flavor test, and I'm just trying to get from you what is it that would give us enough commercial flavor?</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur H. Andrews</label>
            <text syncTime="268.387" offset="1196700">The way I would approach the problem, as pointed out in brief and which I believe is supported by at least Benedict, I would use a twofold sort of test.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.444" offset="1244870">When we are in the traditional blue water sea, more than a marine league, away from the shore, I would use essentially a locality alone test, so that the activity complained of would not have to have a very strong relationship to commerce in order to support maritime jurisprudence or the admiralty jurisdiction of a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.780" offset="1358241">As I moved shoreward and got closer to the beach, and as I moved inward, then I would require that the complained of activity have some closer connection to traditional notions of maritime activity or, i.e., commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.259" offset="1436191">Now, the Kelly v. Smith case is one that definitely gave us problems in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.265" offset="1464194">Judge Thornberry in our argument there indicated that the panel decided our decision would probably not decide Kelly v. Smith the way it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.704" offset="1501915">But you will recall that is the case of the deer poachers who were fleeing an island in the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.890" offset="1530650">Certainly, the court had a good deal of fun in writing that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.963" offset="1558966">One of the things that is important, too, and ought not to be overlooked in Kelly is that there was simply no other cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.819" offset="1594388">All of the state proceedings had prescribed, or the statute had run, in common-law lingo.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.656" offset="1625735">But in Kelly, the remedy, if there was to be a remedy, was to be admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.744" offset="1650081">I view that Kelly v. Smith is more of an extreme example of the lack of a maritime flavor to the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.451" offset="1692922">But look at the location.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.084" offset="1699505">We're talking about the Mississippi River, and a very definite hazard can be posed to commercial navigation because of the activity complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.592" offset="1741510">We've got the Kelly court recognizing that the pilot of the small boat is the pilot that is wounded by the shot from shore, and we have got activity in the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.285" offset="1804308">That is why I think that Kelly ought to be the far parameter--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="426.606" offset="1829595">Really what you are saying, I guess, is that instead of using navigability as the test, you'd use commercial navigability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.406" offset="5476707">And certainly, we had some awkward results when we were applying that law, and the Extension of Admiralty Act eliminated a lot of the injustices that were just inherent in the application of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.648" offset="5525712">I think that it's time that we do look at a little something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.835" offset="5554447">One of the groups of scholars would indicate that they would have maritime nexus without any need for the location to be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.793" offset="5602303">I don't think that this Court ought to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.077" offset="5611394">If we look at the contract cases in the maritime field, we haven't had a heck of a lot of problems with it because despite the fact that we're talking about contract, we have been talking about requiring a maritime nexus there which is almost inevitably commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.456" offset="5684955">And we simply haven't had those problems in the contract, maritime contract field that we have in the maritime personal injury when we have applied the locality alone test, but with the advent of all this pleasure boating and pleasure and sport fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.068" offset="5751410">So something ought to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.086" offset="5759456">I would suggest to you that what I have proposed, and as Professor Benedict points out, I think that's a workable solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.708" offset="5797908">I think, too, that that rule would also help in the real puzzling question of aircraft litigation and aircraft collisions at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.100" offset="5839495">Because there, too, we are talking about... once we are talking about international flights, for example, from New York to London and a crash in the middle of the Atlantic, we are talking... and we start talking about the traditional role of the maritime services in transporting passengers from one country to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.513" offset="5925177">Then there, we don't need that much of a connection to traditional notions of maritime activity, so that you are not doing any injustice or abusing language to try to make something fit in both categories.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.736" offset="6590045">Admiralty law has traditionally, I would suggest, been concerned with navigation, navigation rules and collisions which occur on navigable waterways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.127" offset="6635603">The case of Executive Jet, this Court's case, Aviation v. City of Ohio, tells us that, and Justice Stewart, writing the majority says that the law of admiralty deals with navigation rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.584" offset="6681474">The rules that govern the manner and direction vessels move upon navigable water, and he further states that when a collision occurs, the litigants will look to the law of admiralty with its peculiar expertise in this field to determine the nature of damages and fault and liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.582" offset="8633448">Now, if we adopted, or if you adopted the test which would equate the traditional maritime nexus with waterbound vessels, I think you would be excluding those cases that this Court has expressed it did not want to decide under admiralty law; those cases involving aviation, those cases involving the individual who is injured on the surfboard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.825" offset="11250395">Your Honors, it is submitted under either of the tests that have developed in the circuit courts, attempting to define what this Court meant by traditional wrong bearing a significant relationship to traditional maritime activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.686" offset="11321866">Either the test of St. Hilaire Moye v. Henderson of the Eight Circuit saying that the traditional maritime nexus is met when a waterbound vessel is involved, or the test of Kelly v. Smith of the Fifth Circuit saying that traditional maritime nexus is met when the totality of the circumstances, considering the role and instrumentality, the causation and the parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.085" offset="11419459">Under either one of these tests, the facts of this case support admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.407" offset="11448716">All vessels applying on navigable waters, regardless of their size or commercial status, face these unique hazards of the waters which maritime law, due to its continued experience, is peculiarly suited to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.200" offset="11515903">It is submitted, Your Honor, that because the Fifth Circuit case in this matter recognizes the traditional concept of admiralty law in regard to the factual situation of this case, that Fifth Circuit case promotes the federal interest in keeping our navigable waters free from maritime uses, and also promotes uniformity of commerce and makes jurisdiction readily ascertainable before a collision, not after a collision, and a determination by the courts as to whether or not there is a substantial commercial interest involved; i.e., federal rules of admiralty, or whether it is purely pleasurable, invoking state rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.279" offset="11684236">And because the Fifth Circuit case provides a rational, simple test that is not all-inclusive that would accomplish what this Court would like to do in eliminating certain cases which do not have a nexus to admiralty law from being heard in admiralty, that it should be upheld.</text>
