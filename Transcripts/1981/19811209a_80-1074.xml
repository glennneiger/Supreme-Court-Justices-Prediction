            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="62.823" offset="381022">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.056" offset="386038">May it please the Court, this is a constitutional damages action, so called Bivens action against former Attorney General Edward Levi, former head of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, Richard Velde, and two former subordinate LEAA officials, Charles Work and Herbert Rice.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.937" offset="469525">The plaintiffs are six blacks and six women, and an organization that represents black police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.110" offset="498260">Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in September, 1975, claiming that a number of police organizations that received LEAA monetary grants were engaging in race and sex discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.600" offset="552177">Plaintiffs allege that the defendants' failure to institute administrative proceedings under the LEAA statute to cut off federal funds to these organizations violated their rights under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.360" offset="611213">For this alleged constitutional violation, Plaintiffs demanded that the four defendants pay them $20 million in compensatory and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.468" offset="651651">The district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the defendants were entitled to official immunity from these personal damage claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.074" offset="686028">However, the District of Columbia circuit reversed by a two to one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.976" offset="705672">The majority recognized that this Court in Butz versus Economou had held that administrative officials who perform functions analogous to that of a prosecutor are absolutely immune from personal damages liability, even when constitutional claims are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.754" offset="772755">The court of appeals concluded, however, that Attorney General Levi and the other defendants were not entitled to absolute immunity here, because under the LEAA statute as the court read it they had virtually no discretion in deciding whether to terminate LEAA funding to recipients who were alleged to have engaged in discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.851" offset="857182">Now, the Department of Justice has brought this case to this Court because we believe that the court of appeals decision seriously misconstrues governing legal principles not only of absolute immunity for federal officials but also of what governmental action constitutes a violation of the Equal Protection Component of the due process clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.814" offset="1869062">--Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.666" offset="1876480">Now, we have presented three independent reasons why the decision below is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.137" offset="1898319">First, we claim the defendants are entitled to the absolute immunity recognized in Butz versus Economou for administrative prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.456" offset="1923605">Second, as I just explained, we contend that the complaint in this case fails to state a cause of action against these defendants under the due process clause, the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.679" offset="1964461">Finally, even if the complaint could be construed to state a due process claim, because the defendants acted in good faith and had no reason to know that their actions were unconstitutional, they are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law and should not be forced to undergo a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.874" offset="2033320">The principal issue in this case is one of official immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.760" offset="2044813">In Butz against Economou, this Court held that government officials who must decide whether or when to initiate administrative proceedings play a role similar to that of a prosecutor who must decide whether or not to press criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.319" offset="2103014">For this reason, the Court held that administrative officials, like a prosecutor, are entitled to absolute immunity from personal damages claims, even when constitutional claims are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.510" offset="2159857">This immunity, the court said, is essential to ensure that agency officials may exercise their discretion in deciding whether to bring the weight of the federal government against some respondent for an alleged violation of the law, should be made free from the intimidation that is inevitably associated with the possibility of personal damages liability in the event that someone is unhappy with that decision to charge or not to charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.079" offset="2270093">There is no question here that the defendants collectively were charged with the responsibility for enforcing the LEAA statute, including the anti discrimination provisions, and that when faced with an allegation of discrimination by a fund recipient, they had to decide whether or not to start administrative proceedings to cut off further federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.742" offset="2356716">Defendants had to decide whether a charge of discrimination was likely to have merit, whether the discrimination alleged was sufficiently substantial to warrant the expenditure of LEAA's scarce investigative and prosecutorial resources, whether the ultimate sanction of partial or complete fund termination was the best way of achieving the goal of ending discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.508" offset="2447831">We submit that these are precisely the sort of decisions this Court had in mind in Economou when it referred to agency officials performing functions analogous to that of a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.182" offset="2498508">Now, the only reason that the D. C. circuit offered for refusing to accord the defendants absolute immunity was that the defendants in the court's view had virtually no discretion under the LEAA statute in deciding whether to institute fund termination proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.877" offset="2569248">I suppose Judge Basilon in his opinion for the D. C. circuit viewed the LEAA officials as essentially clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.397" offset="2599341">Once a charge of discrimination came in, they were supposed to follow each succeeding step until the end, and if in the end they determined there was substantial discrimination, they had no discretion other than to cut off funding, and I suppose this would be the case regardless of how many complaints were filed, and regardless of how scarce the prosecutor's resources were.</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.023" offset="5221826">Assuming that the court of appeals was correct in holding that the defendant is not entitled to absolute immunity on this record, we think the court should have affirmed the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the record clearly shows they are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.698" offset="5280549">When this Court decided Butz against Economou, that federal officials ordinarily would have only qualified immunity from personal damages liability in Bivens actions, it did so on the expressed assumption that insubstantial Bivens suits would be quickly disposed of by the lower courts even without the protection of absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.262" offset="5366858">The dissent in Economou stated that the majority's assurances in this regard reflected optimism rather than prescience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.401" offset="5403429">In view if the federal government, based on experience, defending these cases over the last three or four years, the court's assurances in Economou unfortunately have not proven correct.</text>

I think even under the good faith aspect qualified immunity should have been accorded here, but certainly if the only inquiry was whether the law was clearly established, where the defendants violated some clearly established rule of law, I think it is quite clear in this case that the motion for summary judgment based on those grounds should have been granted since I don't think even today it is clear that what the defendants did here violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.487" offset="6283756">It certainly was not clear in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.722" offset="6296712">The government has argued, by the way, for just such a rule of only an objective test for qualified immunity in our brief last year in the Kissinger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.295" offset="6330985">We are not suggesting here that Economou should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.078" offset="6342061">We do think, though, that the Court should give clear guidance to the lower courts that the liberal rules of noticed pleading that may apply generally in civil litigation do not apply with the same force in Bivens actions, and that federal officials should not be forced to undergo discovery or a trial without specific allegations of wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.993" offset="6425757">Allegations in this case do not even come close to meeting the appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.162" offset="6442476">They suggest only that the plaintiffs had a disagreement with the defendants about how the LEAA statute ought to have been administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.484" offset="6475703">We believe that these sorts of disagreements, if they are properly in court at all, should be litigated in injunctive actions such as those authorized by the Administrative Procedure Act, not in personal damages actions with their inevitable tendency to harass and intimidate public officials in the performance of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.979" offset="6549682">Yet, as I said earlier, this case was filed in September, 1975, and six years later these defendants are still trying to escape from under this lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.809" offset="6633065">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, initially I will respond to the government's characterization of several of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.830" offset="6677055">Thereafter, unless this Court chooses otherwise, I would like to respond to the standing issue that was raised by the Court, and then to the three issues that have been raised by the government, the absolute immunity issue, which was ruled upon and rejected by the court below, and then the two other issues which were not ruled on by either court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.943" offset="6765558">First, as to the characterization, I wish to point out that respondents in this case charged the petitioners with refusing to take any enforcement action whatsoever against petitioners' discriminatory grantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.919" offset="6829401">No enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.619" offset="6836298">More particularly, as to administrative fund termination proceedings, petitioners in this case exercised no discretionary enforcement functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.060" offset="6877989">They did not function with discretion in initiating fund termination proceedings, and I will elaborate on all of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.914" offset="6905470">Specifically, I mean, under the regulations in effect at the time that this action was brought, indeed, as described by Petitioner Velde and set forth in the record in this case, the regulations required LEAA to pursue court action and not administrative action to resolve matters of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.412" offset="6995436">Petitioners' deliberate decision to take away this enforcement discretion has deprived them of the discretionary function to enforce administratively their statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.689" offset="7056562">This policy decision, this refusal to act, also meant that the petitioners in this case exceeded the statutory authority that had been placed upon them by Section 518(c)(3) of the Crime Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.198" offset="7118525">In this case, the respondents charge that petitioners' refusal to enforce, coupled with their affirmative provision of continuous funding to grantees which petitioners knew were discriminatory constituted a direct violation of petitioners' Fifth Amendment steer clear obligation, the obligation to steer clear of providing significant aid to discriminatory institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.666" offset="7220402">This case, as counsel for the petitioners indicated, was dismissed on the pleadings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.302" offset="7454982">There are two views of standing on this case, and you are discussing the view of standing that Judge Tam took, looked at in the court below, in the court of appeals, and indeed, he found that we had standing under that view with regard to redressability, with regard to the cutoff of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.829" offset="7525094">I mean, this is even apart from the Fifth Amendment obligation and the violation that we referred to with the federal petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.400" offset="7551426">But on redressability, simply focusing on the police departments, we think that there is more than a substantial likelihood that indeed the grantees would end their discrimination rather than lose their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.627" offset="7604298">As we point out in our brief, three branches, the three coordinate branches of the federal government have already recognized the coercive power of fund termination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.214" offset="10822583">Most important is the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.532" offset="10835853">As I pointed out at the outset, the government petitioners uniformly adhered to an unlawful regulation which Petitioner Velde stated in this record that that... that those regulations require LEAA to pursue court action and not administrative action to resolve matters of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.912" offset="10925401">Indeed, that regulation and the interpretation of that regulation were uniformly followed by the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.101" offset="10954136">There never was an initiation of administrative fund termination proceedings until this case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.689" offset="10980572">After this case was filed, the unlawful regulation was ultimately repealed, and pursuant to our motion for a preliminary injunction and the general deterrent effect of bringing a damage action, petitioners began to enforce, but prior to this, they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.198" offset="11038564">In other words, they did not have any discretion that might even be described as prosecutorial discretion because they had deprived themselves of that discretion to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.370" offset="11079210">Indeed, in their affidavits, their pre Butz affidavits, the government petitioners in this case nowhere described their functions as prosecutorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.128" offset="11122260">They described themselves as administrators, and they described their policymaking functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.916" offset="11141486">Indeed, no petitioner in the affidavits any place claimed responsibility for not initiating administrative proceedings in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.687" offset="11180565">Of course, to do so would have been exactly what we have charged the petitioners with, and that is exceeding their statutory authority under Section 518(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.310" offset="11219018">The legislative history, as Justice Blackmun points out, is as obvious and clear as the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.199" offset="11250573">The statute says that whenever the administration makes the determination, it shall move forward and initiate the administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.622" offset="11284219">That was violated here, and accordingly not only did we allege that the petitioners, the government petitioners had violated the Fifth Amendment, but indeed they had exceeded the scope of their duty under their statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2862.551" offset="11580030">On the other hand, it is absolutely clear that with regard to a grantee, a grantee has under Section 509, 510, 511 of the Act, does have administrative review of the record on that particular action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.328" offset="11639067">There is a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.011" offset="11641783">There can be a rehearing, and there also is judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.182" offset="11658502">The government's second argument which was not raised below or ruled on below is that the respondents here do not have a Fifth Amendment cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.107" offset="11706253">As this Court pointed out earlier, we believe that this is basically a statement of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.760" offset="11732794">It is a question going to proof, and in this case there was no discovery, and a proof argument simply cannot be turned into a pleading argument, and our pleadings are more than adequate to state a Fifth Amendment cause of action, as the government even concedes under Bivens and under Davis particularly, and also under Carlson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.776" offset="11824849">Finally, the government argues that this case could have been decided on summary judgment, and that this Court for the first time in this case should act as a trier of fact and rule on a summary judgment motion that was not ruled on by either court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.737" offset="11904680">We submit that it would have been wrong for the trial court to have ruled on the qualified immunity issue on summary judgment had it been filed in the trial court, and indeed, it would be improper for this Court to address this issue for the first time here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.849" offset="11965179">But particularly disturbing, indeed, I found particularly astounding is the government's argument that the normal civil... the rules that govern normal civil litigation do not apply with equal force in Bivens actions against federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.843" offset="12037173">Indeed, in Butz v. Economou, this Court held that the standards that apply to state officials apply with equal import to federal officials, and indeed in Butz this Court specifically invoked the federal rules of civil procedure, holding that a good faith immunity on summary judgment is subject to a properly supported motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.909" offset="12141453">Indeed, if there is any doubt about this issue with regard to the application of Rule 56 standards to the government, the advisory committee notes to Rule 56 expressly state in the very first sentence, this rule is applicable to all actions, including those against the United States, or an officer or agency thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.526" offset="12239883">As we have pointed out quite extensively in our brief, it would have been wrong as a matter of law for the court below if it had been asked to rule on qualified immunity to have granted qualified immunity in favor of the petitioners on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.503" offset="12295785">Rule 56 was not complied with by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.671" offset="12312503">For these reasons, Your Honors, we believe that the court of appeals decision below should be affirmed, and the government's arguments in this case rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.446" offset="12355553">We also believe for the reasons that I point out that there is standing in this case, that indeed one plaintiff has already conclusively demonstrated standing, and under many of this Court's decisions, including the unanimous decision last week, in Watt v. Energy Action, there is standing in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.821" offset="12617091">Second, it is important to realize, because so much focus has been on the 1973 and 1976 amendments, that those were just amendments to Section 518(c)(2) of the statute, which is the antidiscrimination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.215" offset="12682606">But there is a separate section which has been in the statute since the very beginning, Section 509, which is the fund termination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.620" offset="12716252">Section 518(c)(2) simply says if the administration makes a number of findings, then it should look to Section 509 for fund termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.576" offset="12752092">So, it is Section 509 that arguably is in the plaintiff's view non discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.046" offset="12778005">We would refer the Court to the House report on Section 509 which is quoted at Page 22 of our brief, which says that under Section 509, the Attorney General may terminate or suspend payments on a finding that there is a substantial failure to comply, and that he has broad discretionary power over the fund termination process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.380" offset="12883331">Now, third, as I understand Mr. Larson, he has changed the theory of the plaintiff's case yet again in response to Justice Rehnquist's earlier questions, because as I understood the theory of plaintiff's case this morning, it was that it is irrelevant what the grantees would or would not have done if the funding had been terminated, and that is found on Page 36 of their brief, when they explain why cases like Simon versus Eastern Kentucky are irrelevant here, but now we are told that that is their theory, and that they made allegations to that effect in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.572" offset="13032020">The final point I want to make is that although there was no discovery in this case because a motion to dismiss was quickly filed, respondents did get massive discovery from LEAA under the Freedom of Information Act while this case was pending, and they submitted voluminous materials in response to the defendant's summary judgment motion.</text>
