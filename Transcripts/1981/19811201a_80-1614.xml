            <text syncTime="59.555" offset="369351">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.646" offset="385756">This case comes before the Court on certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and is to review the judgment of that court affirming the decision of the Tax Court sustaining assessments of deficiencies in gift taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.905" offset="466736">The case involves the question of whether or not effective disclaimers of bequests can be made by a contingent remainderman under a testamentary trust where the life estates that precede the contingent remainderman's interest still exist free of federal gift tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.939" offset="574883">The facts are simple and not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.766" offset="594213">My client, the taxpayer's, grandmother died in 1939 leaving a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.372" offset="628695">The will provided that the bulk of her estate would be left in trust with life estates to her husband, her son, and her son's wife... the son and the wife being the father and mother of my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.163" offset="687836">Both the husband of the settlor and my client's father have died and died before the disclaimers in this case were executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="733394">However, my client's mother still lives and is the remaining life beneficiary under the testatrix will.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.108" offset="771637">The will, as I may have said, was filed in probate in Massachusetts and was allowed in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.150" offset="811761">I should note also that at that time the taxpayer was 12 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.459" offset="844989">In 1972 at a time in which the taxpayer was 45 years old by two separate disclaimers, which are admittedly valid and effective under state law, he disclaimed his entire interest with the contingent remainderman under his grandmother's will.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.653" offset="941746">And it is agreed, as I understand it, that he had no interest thereunder after 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.663" offset="2701772">I think it's important to an understanding of this case before we get to the precise provisions of the regulation itself which really govern the outcome to discuss very briefly the legal context that was in existence when this regulation was promulgated in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.513" offset="2785260">At that time it was quite clear that valid and effective disclaimers as a matter of federal common law, if you will, did not affect a gift along the lines that you and I discussed, Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.929" offset="2858925">The case that decided that is the Brown against Routzahn, and that was an old case in the Sixth Circuit in Ohio, and had been followed, to the extent that these cases had been decided, I think without any exception except one, the Hardenbergh case, again in the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.278" offset="2960280">In Hardenbergh there was an intestacy, and under the law of the state an intestacy automatically vested title to the bequest in the hands of the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.633" offset="3001658">There was nothing you could do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.399" offset="3004793">It happened as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.038" offset="3011271">Under those circumstances the Eighth Circuit said well, a disclaimer cannot be made under these circumstances because you can't avoid obtaining title to the property; the law gives it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.314" offset="3068427">And any disposition of it is subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.236" offset="3080130">That was the status of the law at the time this was promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.077" offset="3099461">The regulation itself by its provisions makes it quite clear that what was intended to be done was to codify this common law as it related to disclaimers insofar as the Internal Revenue Act of 1954 was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.820" offset="3170409">And in fact there has been recently released a technical memorandum to that effect making it explicitly clear that that was the intent of the Internal Revenue Service in advising the Treasury of the recommendation for the adoption of this regulation 1211-1(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="778.920" offset="3246896">The common law also, without exception, treated the beginning of the period beyond which a disclaimer could not be effected as being the point where the contingent remainderman in this case first obtained ownership of the property; that is, once it became vested fully it became then his property, and the time under state law within which it could thereafter be disclaimed began to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.517" offset="3385240">And that whole body of law, we submit, was embodied in this attempt to codify the law, with one exception; and that is, as the Keinath court pointed out, the regulation intended to install a common period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.414" offset="3460786">The duration of the period of time was to be a reasonable period beyond the date of transfer, and I'll get to that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.534" offset="3509270">This is not the commencement of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.550" offset="3521390">It is the duration of the time that was said to be layered over, if you will, by the Internal Revenue Service; and we don't contest that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.607" offset="3569560">In fact, we quite readily recognize the Internal Revenue Service can adopt for federal tax purposes a different period of time than perhaps the various states have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.134" offset="3615745">Now, with that understanding of what the context of the law was, I would like to turn very briefly to the language itself of the regulation in an effort to demonstrate to you that it, in effect, in express terms provides that the time beyond which my client could not effectively disclaim his interest without incurring a federal gift tax liability commences upon the date when he, if he ever does, obtains the full quality and quantity of vested ownership in the property; that is, if he survives the life tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.490" offset="3789093">The full text is set forth in the petition for certiorari in the appendix at page 30, and I will make only brief references to the precise language, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.313" offset="3840398">The critical point reads as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="932.718" offset="3862027">"A refusal to accept ownership does not constitute the making of a gift if the refusal is made within a reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="949.429" offset="3928901">Now the question is well, what is the transfer that initiates this time period?</text>
            <text syncTime="957.020" offset="3959203">Well, there are in fact two transfers referred to in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.689" offset="3981877">The first is, just briefly above that, is a transfer or rather a refusal to accept ownership of property transferred from a decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.310" offset="4032450">So that in one aspect the transfer has to be the transfer of the property from the decedent without any retained interest or without any rights of revocation or the like; and that is accomplished in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.319" offset="4088457">The second reference is further down, and there it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="994.676" offset="4109877">"If a person fails to refuse to accept a transfer to him. "</text>
            <text syncTime="999.455" offset="4128999">--note "transfer to him"...</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.893" offset="4138716">"of ownership of a decedent's property within a reasonable time after learning of the existence of the transfer, he will be presumed to have accepted the property. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.592" offset="4181557">Now we know that the transfer must be first from the settlor and also must be to the person who is disclaiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.462" offset="4221054">That second step has not yet happened and had not yet happened in 1972, because at that time he had only a contingent interest dependent upon his ability to survive his mother.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.868" offset="5150595">The facts with respect to that finding are even more so true today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.714" offset="8233985">The federal gift tax is imposed upon all gifts, direct and indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.008" offset="8263242">That is the teaching of Section 2511 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.161" offset="8295843">A disclaimer of the type involved in this case provides a mechanism for indirect gifts, because property which is directed to a person who doesn't want it, he can disclaim and in the act of disclaiming he causes that property, that interest to be directed to the next party in succession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.991" offset="8427082">This is not an indirect gift to an identifiable person, Mr. Chief Justice, but for gift tax purposes that is of no consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.939" offset="8474938">This Court in Robinette v. Helvering almost 40 years ago said gifts of future interest are taxable under the Act, and they do not lose this quality merely because of the indefiniteness of the eventual recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.511" offset="8545260">The Petitioner is purported to give the property to someone whose identity could be later ascertained, and this was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.131" offset="8575666">That is the purport and operation of the gift tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.036" offset="8599281">Now, there is an exception which takes a disclaimer outside the operation of the gift tax, and that is the exception, the grace period, the act of grace, as Mr. Justice Blackmun put it, which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.310" offset="8672424">The regulation is Section 1.2511-1(c), and it provides that a disclaimer can be made free of gift tax if two requirements are fulfilled: one, it must be valid and effective under state law; and two, it must be made within a reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.408" offset="8784750">If those requirements are met, the tax law will consider that the disclaimant never had the property and did not transfer it to the next person or class in line, but that it passed directly from the settlor or the testate or here the testatrix to the next person in line.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.205" offset="8931977">The history seems to indicate that the drafters only meant to codify the Brown-Hardenbergh rule which really left it up to state law to determine the federal tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2217.604" offset="9001567">I think that the Brown-Hardenbergh cases which have been discussed in the brief deal solely with the question of the disclaimant's capability under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.551" offset="9061335">If you will recall, Hardenbergh was a case in which a person took by intestacy, and the Court held that under state law a person who took by intestacy was incapable under state law of disclaiming, that he had to take it, that state policy required it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.576" offset="9129462">In Brown that was the situation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2256.370" offset="9156630">Those cases dealt with the situation of the disclaimant's capability of lack of capability under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.242" offset="9196127">And indeed, the regulation uses state law as one of the requirements; that if a disclaimant, at least before the 1981 Act, was incapable of making a disclaimer under state law, he wasn't going to come within this exception, and he was going to have made a taxable gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.889" offset="9278674">That's what happened in the Hardenbergh case, because under state law the disclaimant there was someone who took by intestacy, and as a result he couldn't disclaim, and he was deemed to have made a taxable gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.352" offset="9340532">In Brown he wasn't such a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.445" offset="9352966">It was a surviving husband who decided that he didn't want his wife's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.864" offset="9370625">But this much is clear, that the regulation has two requirements: one, capability under state law, and two, that the disclaimer must be made within a reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.483" offset="9433110">Now, how do these principles apply in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.701" offset="9441991">We have no quarrel here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.012" offset="9451186">The parties had no quarrel that this was a valid and effective disclaimer under Massachusetts law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.963" offset="9475010">But the parties do quarrel about whether Mr. Jewett made a disclaimer within a reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.068" offset="9527464">Here the grandmother, Margaret, died in 1939, but Mr. Jewett, the grandson, did not disclaim until 1972, 33 years after the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.186" offset="9583888">Now, that was 24 years after he obtained his majority because Mr. Jewett was born in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.917" offset="9614817">Now, this might have been valid and effective under state law because the policies of whether a disclaimer will be given effect under state law, as Judge Rahm ably pointed out in the opinion of the Tax Court, have little, if anything, to do with the policies underlying the gift tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.223" offset="9688065">Under no stretch of the imagination, he concluded... and we feel the facts fully support his conclusion... were these disclaimers made within a reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.982" offset="9751072">And indeed, my brother here does not argue, and indeed he really couldn't, that the 33-year period or the 24-year period would be a reasonable time, nor does he attempt to justify this inordinate delay on any special fact that knowledge was withheld from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.114" offset="9831634">How does he claim to meet this reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.503" offset="9857129">Well, he first claims on reliance on the Keinath case that state law is sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.490" offset="12889110">It also went to the question of reasonable time, and that really goes to the whole essence, I think, of what the gift tax is all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.293" offset="13136332">In fact, he was able to use the mechanism of disclaimer as an inter vivos estate planning device.</text>
