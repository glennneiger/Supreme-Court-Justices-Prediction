            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="49.747" offset="324485">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.663" offset="328142">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.282" offset="338591">This federal income tax case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.852" offset="364922">It involves a definition of controlled group of corporations and component members.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.689" offset="392194">A technical area of the tax law that we believe appropriately lends itself to elucidation by means of the Commissioner's Treasury Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.527" offset="435557">And at the outset I would like to point out to the Court that there is a regulation that specifically addresses the facts of this case, with an explicit example that governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.204" offset="486339">As we shall point out later in our argument, the Court of Claims admitted in its opinion that the Commissioner's regulation was not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.393" offset="527090">But it went on to hold that the regulation was invalid because it believed that its interpretation of the statute served better purposes and was more reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.200" offset="570245">At the outset, I think it bears repeating that under an unbroken line of decisions of this Court, the question in this case is not whether the Court of Claims has reached a more reasonable interpretation of the statute, but rather, the question is whether the Commissioner's regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.531" offset="655613">We think it is, and with this admonition in mind, I think we can turn to the particular statute at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.554" offset="683720">It is Section 1563(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, pertinent parts of which are set out at the bottom of page 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.778" offset="740563">At the outset, I think it's important to point out to the Court what the purpose of this statute was, which I think is beyond dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.335" offset="782777">The corporate income tax is made up of two levels, a basic rate and a surtax.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.239" offset="810467">For example, a 30 % normal rate and a 25 % surtax, and the rates keep changing, but normally, it's on the first $25,000 there is the normal rate, and then the combined normal rate and surtax on the remainder of taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.884" offset="885072">Because of this split in brackets, it has been attempted by various business organizations to split income among many different corporations which are essentially part of the same economic enterprise, to reduce the overall tax burden of a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.582" offset="979845">And because of that, the Commissioner has, in the past, had a number of statutory weapons at his disposal; for example, Section 269 and 1551 of the Code, which required a judicial inquiry as to whether these corporations were formed or split up for the purpose of reducing taxes or getting an additional surtax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.037" offset="1101680">Because of the difficulty of probing and deriving these factual... entry of these factual increase, Congress finally adopted this statute in 1964 and amended it in 1969 to establish a precise mathematical test.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.384" offset="1187048">And if you are a controlled group of corporations, then the component members of the group must either share the corporate surtax exemption or pay a 6 % penalty, if they're going to each claim a separate surtax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.495" offset="1259459">Now, the particular controlled group involved in this case is the so-called brother-sister group, and it is defined, as we point out here for pertinent parts of the statute, in two different subparagraphs of Section 1563(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="303.659" offset="1340125">The provision says two or more corporations... that is a brother-sister group... if five or fewer persons who are individuals own stock possessing (A) at least 80 % of the stock of each corporation, and (B) more than 50 % of the stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person, only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.512" offset="1567495">We think the regulation at issue here fully implements the plain language of the statute and is consistent with the congressional purpose of eliminating multiple surtax exemptions for corporations controlled as a single economic entity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="556.215" offset="2350333">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, when the recess occurred, we were discussing the text of Section 1563(a)(2), which is set forth in pertinent part at the bottom of page 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.177" offset="2422222">The statute defines a brother-sister group, which consists of, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="580.081" offset="2445836">"two or more corporations, if five or fewer persons who are individuals own stock possessing (A) at least 80 % of the stock of each corporation, and (B) more than 50 % of the stock of each corporation taking into account the stock ownership of each such person, only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="612.200" offset="2574254">The statute has two parts, an 80 % test and a 50 % test.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.354" offset="2598914">Perhaps the best way to attack the statute on the facts of this case is to first put out of the way the 50 % test, the applicability of which is undisputed here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="630.863" stopTime="647.439">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="630.863" offset="2648965">Let me ask you one question, Mr. Smith, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.715" offset="2660354">With the 80 % rule in the statute itself, doesn't... isn't that made almost superfluous by the regulation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="647.439" stopTime="717.532">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="647.439" offset="2715211">No, because the 80 % rule, or part of the statute, is still important in order to insure that the corporations be closely held.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.283" offset="2774666">The 50 % test was added to the statute in 1969 at a time when the number of shareholders went from one to five in order to retain commonality of ownership or overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.827" offset="2844778">And I think the best way to illustrate that is on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.731" offset="2864423">Here we have two shareholders, Arthur Vogel and Richard Crain, and two corporations, Vogel Fertilizer and Vogel Popcorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.603" offset="2903920">Now, Arthur Vogel owns 77.49 % of Fertilizer, and Richard Crain owns the remaining 22.51 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.410" offset="2951149">Arthur Vogel owns 87.5 % of Popcorn, and the remaining shares of Popcorn are owned by a trust.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="732.792" offset="3056684">The statute applies because of Crain's interest in Fertilizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.160" offset="3074134">And I think that the words of the statute support our submission that the statute applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.564" offset="3095763">Let me first put out of the way the application of the 50 % test in subparagraph (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="749.218" offset="3122408">The italicized words which we have italicized at the bottom of page 6 of our brief, the taking into account the stock ownership, works as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.442" offset="3167234">You find out... you take into account the stock ownership of each such person as to the extent it is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.846" offset="3200880">In this particular case, the identical stock ownership is 77.49 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.535" offset="3227629">Arthur Vogel owns that amount in Vogel Fertilizer, and indeed, he owns 87 % of Vogel Popcorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.558" offset="3263678">So using 77 %, to round the figures, as the identical stock ownership, subparagraph (B) of the statute which demands that five or fewer persons own more than 50 % of the stock of each corporation is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.602" offset="3335880">Because indeed, Arthur Vogel is one person; one is less than five, and the required overlap is met.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.373" offset="7738976">Your Honors, it appears that the sharpest division between the government and the taxpayer comes in defining the functions and the interactions of the 80 % and the 50 % tests, and how these functions advance the design of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.133" offset="7801983">Now, if I may just reiterate and summarize for you what I believe the differences are, I think this would help very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.453" offset="7827270">The taxpayer's interpretation, our interpretation of the statute is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.106" offset="7845869">We apply the 80 % test first, and that follows from words located in the statute, if for no other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.777" offset="7872618">And the 80 % test is a test of financial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.212" offset="7890382">This test is designed to require an aggregate ownership representing substantially the entire financial interest in all the corporations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.437" offset="7935208">This is where we get to the economic entity idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.722" offset="7944403">We are trying to find the entire financial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.008" offset="7957464">Now, why is a financial interest necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.626" offset="7968018">It's necessary because the conduct sanctioned by this particular statute is the exercise of control over more than one corporation by a small group of persons for their own substantial financial interest in the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.469" offset="8031338">With this function, commonality is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.004" offset="8045549">Now, the 50 % test, I believe that both the government and myself agree, is one of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.027" offset="8069582">It identifies the degree of control necessary to allow the corporations to be operated as one economic entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.097" offset="8097898">Now, we believe that our interpretation of the particular statute gives both tests a separate and distinct function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.501" offset="8131440">The government, on the other hand, interprets the statute in such a manner that both of the tests, the 80 % and the 50 % tests, are tests of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.058" offset="8173758">The 50 % test, which they would apply first, determines whether the corporations have a commonality of control through common stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.080" offset="8209807">We don't really have any argument with that particular definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.049" offset="8221719">But their 80 % test ensures only that the stock is closely held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.020" offset="8245543">The exemption is saved under their interpretation if there are shareholders outside the 50 % five or fewer group that own more than 20 % of its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.459" offset="8283368">Now, I would submit that under the government's interpretation, 1563 as a scheme wherein the 80 % test has no separate meaning by itself and is redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.915" offset="8325164">If Congress had meant and intended both tests to be tests of control, what does 80 % add that 50 % doesn't already have?</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.420" offset="8359123">You can control a corporation with both of those items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.538" offset="8371662">Congress must meant more than this.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="2239.477" offset="9083342">--That's right, before his stock could be counted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.929" offset="9093164">Now, if I might present an example, I think that this will bring the unreasonableness of the government's 80 % test in view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.034" offset="9133601">Let's suppose that one of you owns 70 % of corporation number one, in which I own 30 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.021" offset="9157529">Tax time rolls around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.973" offset="9165366">Of course, the Tax Court, as you probably already well know, says that there is a surprise visited upon me, and perhaps upon you, in that the surtax exemption is lost or is at least shared if you, all of sudden, I all of a sudden find out, that you own not just one other corporation as the Tax Court says, but four other corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.653" offset="9256063">And let's assume that in those four other corporations you own 70 % of each one, including the one I am in, the fifth one, and there is a different 30 % shareholder in each corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.793" offset="9312697">So we have 70 % going across, if I can draw a schematic here, and 30 % going down, with each different shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.047" offset="9337670">Now, not only is the corporation in which you and I own stock... not only does that corporation lose its surtax exemption or at least shares its surtax exemption under the regulation, but also those other corporations lose their surtax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.759" offset="9404543">Now which one, which corporate group, which brother-sister controlled group are we in?</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.563" offset="9431711">What we have is five corporations with six shareholders, and the statute says you can only count five shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.086" offset="9457833">Are we in the brother-sister controlled group comprising corporations one through four, leaving the fifth one out?</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.739" offset="9488449">Are we in the corporations one through three, leaving four and five in separate group?</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.774" offset="9508615">Are we not in a brother-sister controlled group at all, but two through five, corporations two through five are in separate brother-sister controlled group?</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.499" offset="9551456">This type of arbitrary determination I believe illustrates the unreasonableness of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.586" offset="9579877">Now, the regulation does have, in a separate part, a provision dealing with overlapping interest like this, but it simply provides that the corporations are to get together and somehow allocate among themselves the exemption at the time they file their tax return, or suffer the allocation subsequently made by the Commissioner at tax audit time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.232" offset="9662424">But how can the parties make this allocation if, prior to audit, they don't even know who is in the group?</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.803" offset="9684680">And what policy reason is served by treating identically-owned corporations; that is, 70-30 corporations, in each one in a different manner?</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.492" offset="9719476">Thus, I submit that the regulation's 80 % test draws a totally artificial line, and creates an unreasonable design not intended by Congress, by arbitrarily excluding a corporation with a pattern of ownership that is identical to every other corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.704" offset="9788334">Again, from a policy standpoint, either all of the corporations owned 70-30 should be in the group or none should be, and we, of course, submit that none should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.143" offset="9830026">There is no indication anywhere that Congress ever intended to lay such a trap for the expanded group of unknowing minority shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.451" offset="9871299">Now, if I might turn for a second to the proper test that the government has allocated should be applied to this particular example, this particular reg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.913" offset="9941098">Your Honors, the regulation in question is, without a dispute, without any dispute whatsoever, an example of an interpretive regulation rather than a legislative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.934" offset="9985193">That is, I define a legislative regulation as one written in direct response to a specific delegation of authority by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.671" offset="10016122">That's the difference between this case and the Portland Cement case, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.742" offset="10032423">This regulation, on the other hand, is written under the general auspices of Section 7805.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.896" offset="10057082">Now, I well understand the general reluctance and the general wisdom of this Court to not overturn contemporaneous constructions of a statute by those charged with its administration, and who... and those people who are presumably well aware of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.156" offset="10126150">I believe that the test should be in such a case, though, whether that regulation implements the congressional mandate in some reasonable manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.963" offset="10165334">As recognized by the Court of Claims in this case and supported by this Court's recent decision last summer in Rowan Companies, the rule of a difference, however, is not appropriate in this case when the Treasury is interpreting a definition specifically set forth in a statute, such as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.091" offset="10245895">Because we can't in this case measure the Commissioner's definition word for word against a statutory definition of the term brother-sister controlled group, the proper test that we ultimately get to to determine whether the congressional mandate has been fulfilled is to look to see whether the regulation in question harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin and its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.872" offset="10344952">We submit that it fails on all three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.074" offset="10353729">The regulation, going to the plain language of the statute first, the regulation, of course, clearly adds four very important words to its otherwise word-for-word recitation of what the statute says, and those words are singly or in combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.786" offset="10428648">Thus, I'd submit that on its face, the regulation adds to the statute words that Congress did not write.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.940" offset="10453203">Without a doubt then, this regulation can hardly be said to harmonize with the statutory definition as required by the Rowan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.360" offset="10486953">The government, of course, has advanced the theory that its regulation, in spite of this lack of harmony, correctly interprets the statute under some type of a natural reading theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.984" offset="10525405">While this type of analysis may have initially its appeal, the problem with such a natural reading, as you have alluded to, is that it ignores the well-established and commonly-used guidelines of English grammar and usage in interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.827" offset="10588831">Of course, Congress could have emphasized that the 80 % test required common ownership by reiterating the phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.700" offset="10624253">"each such person in the 80 % test as well as in the 50 %. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.735" offset="10640449">but it really didn't mean to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.337" offset="10646823">First of all, it was not abandoning the principle of common ownership as found in the 1964 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.109" offset="10677960">Second of all, it was not ignoring the English language in the structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.644" offset="10696037">These two factors we believe effectively cause such phrase to be part of the 80 % test without the need for Congress to reiterate the phrase in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.600" offset="10735848">Now, this particular interpretation, I want to emphasize, does not import the entire identical interest clause into the 80 % test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.371" offset="10779002">It merely illustrates the use by statutory analysis of what persons should be in the 80 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.061" offset="10809722">And once you have that group determined, these two tests then work separately to fulfill their purposes as Congress intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.250" offset="11886489">Well, there are 16 when the Court is at full strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.868" offset="11900909">I'm not sure whether 16 judges were on this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.606" offset="11919926">And, of course, that decision was reversed by the Fourth Circuit, as was the Tax Court reversed by the Eight and the Second Circuit, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.712" offset="11960364">I simply want to re-emphasize to the Court that we think that based on the Court of Claims, concession here that the Commissioner's regulation was not an unreasonable interpretation of the statute... and I think I have demonstrated to the Court that the plain language of the statute supports the Commissioner's interpretation... that we think under the decisions of this Court, that the regulation should be approved as a valid interpretation of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.485" offset="12111456">I think we ought to win without the regulation because I think the plain language of the statute supports us, and I think the legislative history supports us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.157" offset="12146147">And I simply want to say in closing that at the time... and this really goes to the point that Justice O'Connor and I were exploring... at the time that Congress amended the statute in 1969 to expand the shareholder group from one to five, it did in our view make the 50 % test accomplish the common control purpose of the statute and leave the 80 % test simply to represent... to carry the closely-held character of the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.116" offset="12297970">And at the time that Congress was expanding this group from one to five, the House Ways and Means Committee ratified the Treasury's statement that it intended to adopt the same test here that it did in Section 1551, which has a comparable mathematical test, although there is also a factual inquiry that has to be made in that statute as to whether the corporation was formed to receive the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.349" offset="12414894">And at the time, 1969, there was on the books for at least two years a Treasury regulation under Section 1551; precisely, 1551-1G, Example 4, which we cite in our brief, which sets forth an example which demonstrates that under Section 1551, that not every member of the five or fewer persons has to own stock in each corporation for the 80 % test to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.939" offset="12549268">And presumably, the same Treasury that was recommending the expansion of the test knew what the regulation said, and basically so did the tax-writing committees of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.080" offset="12593781">And it seems to us with this legislative history and with the peculiar result that would be reached under the respondent's interpretation where a single share of stock would cause a different result, based on the plain language we think the Court of Claims was wrong.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3133.006" offset="12657520">Mr. Smith, wouldn't you agree that at the time that the Treasury Department was talking to the Congress, when this act was passed, that their explanation was far from clear and didn't set forth the position that was subsequently adopted in the Treasury regulation?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="3154.087" offset="12741843">I think I would agree that I would prefer... my case would be stronger... if the Treasury studies adopted... had the same language as the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.061" offset="12785729">But the regulation came not far down the road as a contemporaneous construction of the statute, and given the history, Justice O'Connor, of the similarity that Congress was attempting to use in this statute as in Section 1551, I think it's fair to conclude that what Congress intended to do was to adopt the same test that existed in the 1551 regulation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3195.247" offset="12906519">Well, I do have concerns about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.447" offset="12911221">It looks somewhat as though the Treasury Department had second thoughts after the Act was passed and then adopted the regulation, and that it didn't have the same thoughts when it was talking to the Congress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="3210.357" stopTime="3280.734">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="3210.357" offset="12966914">I don't think that it's fair to conclude that on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.327" offset="12982796">There is really nothing to indicate that the regulation was an afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.695" offset="13000246">Many regulations, as common practice, follow the enactment of the statute by some time after studies and, you know, they're proposed and then circulated for comment and then come out in final form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.622" offset="13055939">I will say that on pages 27 and 28 we set forth a portion of the Treasury proposals, and they talk about, to a large extent, a group of corporations in which five or fewer persons own, to a large extent, in identical portions at least 90 % of the stock of each of the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.619" offset="13139949">And it goes on then to describe the 50 % test in terms of the stock of a particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.522" offset="13163564">So I think one could derive, as indeed some of the decisions have which we have held for the regulation, the fact that the Treasury studies are not inconsistent with the regulation that ultimately came out, pursuant to the Commissioner's authority to prescribe all need for rules.</text>
