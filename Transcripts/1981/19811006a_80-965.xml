            <text syncTime="229.714" offset="1045086">We think this is not similar, Justice Rehnquist, to a statute of limitations because it is essentially different in its character and primarily different because the intent of the statute, as we see it both in terms of what briefs have been filed on behalf of the Appellees and the state as well as the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court was, to extinguish these interests, and the notice provision, the grace period provision, was merely incidental to that but it was not with the intent of preserving the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.819" offset="1181549">Now, statutes of limitation, by their very nature, go to the question of retaining the integrity of the judicial process.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.966" offset="1378095">We say there is a vested right in this property which is involved here, but in terms of statutes of limitations, everybody understands that a time is running on a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.375" offset="1435773">And you have to understand there is a time limitation after which it runs out.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.113" offset="1454686">That was not true of the interests that are involved here prior to the passage of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.283" offset="1479345">And we think that the purpose of a statute of limitations is to retain the integrity of the judicial process, is a far cry from the statute we have here, which deals with an intent to extinguish a valid property right interest, only because the state determines that they think it could be better developed by somebody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.381" offset="3815737">But under Indiana law, as in Virginia law and most other state law, when you sell property at tax sale, the man is entitled to notice that his property is about to be sold at tax sale, with the right to redeem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.089" offset="4278627">--Justice O'Connor, the difference between this and the Marketable Titles Act, for example, is that the purpose of the Marketable Titles Act is to clear up appendages to titles that go back, in the case of Indiana, 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.264" offset="4343306">And there, you must have a 50-year chain of clear title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.435" offset="4367966">At the end of that 50-year period if you had 50 years chain of clear title, then the law under the Marketable Titles Act says we will confirm what you've always claimed in that 50 years to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.612" offset="4420733">The man in possession gets no more than what he has, in fact, claimed for the last 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.764" offset="4441318">In one sense, marketable title acts are like adverse possession on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.419" offset="4467963">On the record you've been claiming these interests for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.787" offset="4481442">If you do so and the record is clear, at the end of that time, the law says, we're going to get rid of those old claims and you have a perfected title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.910" offset="4521879">On the dormant mineral interest statute, however... in this case, for example, Mrs. Short who acquired this property in 1974 had her property deed to her specifically setting forth these mineral interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.657" offset="4600874">Now, that would not qualify for marketable title because she didn't have a chain going back 50 years back to remanence of title that didn't show these interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.398" offset="4655835">So what Mrs. Short ends up by virtue of this statute in having a title in more than she acquired when she purchased the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.222" offset="4703169">In marketable titles you only get what you've been claiming and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.843" offset="4721664">So here, what you've done is to enhance the title that the man had and you do it within a two year period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.455" offset="6904038">In that instance, there was declared a taking because they could not take out all the subsurface coal, they would not let them allow subsidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.129" offset="6954820">They didn't take all of the rights; they took part of the rights, and yet they said there was a taking, even though the benefit of the taking accrued to the surface owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.404" offset="6991914">And that's what accrues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.971" offset="6998183">The taking, they argue, is not a taking because the benefit goes to the surface owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.008" offset="7026291">And yet Mahon is directly in point on the issue that you can still have a taking, even if the benefit is to the surface owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.931" offset="7057951">So we think that the Mahon case and the later cases clearly show a taking assuming that there is no valid notice that would be required under procedural due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.642" offset="7480821">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I'd like to commence by attempting to clarify for Justice Stevens what I believe is probably the situation concerning severed mineral taxation in both Indiana and, insofar as I know, the state of Illinois, which is about the limits of my general knowledge about this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.838" offset="7573608">The policy seems to be that if the interest is being developed or is in use, then it is subject to a form of local ad valorem taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.896" offset="7621883">Also, if it is owned by a coal company or some operative organization which is in the process of producing coal, then generally that interest is placed on the tax rolls and assessed for taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.088" offset="7682591">Otherwise, interests in the hands of individuals are generally considered perhaps not very valuable and that it's not administratively very remunerative to impose taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.002" offset="7766287">The Indiana Dormant Mineral Act we submit is essentially a recording act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.858" offset="7801709">The General Assembly determined that because of the elusive character of severed minerals, these types of interest required a re recording periodically for the maintenance of the public records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.515" offset="7856358">It also acts as a statute of limitations with respect to claims which remain, for whatever reason, unrecorded for a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.637" offset="7896795">The type of severances most affected by this act are severances of coal, oil, gas or any or all of them, either by a mineral deed or by a reservation in a general warranty deed, and these severances generally are perpetual on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.885" offset="7981745">Unfortunately, the record in this case comes to the Court without any factual background concerning why the statute may have been enacted or why it was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.792" offset="8029393">And if you will, I'm going to ask the Court to permit me to indulge in a few assumptions which I believe are reasonable and would form the basis of this statute in the mind of a legislator dealing with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.654" offset="8096893">First of all, my home county, Gibson County, has a total area of about 320,000 acres, or approximately 500 sections.</text>

            <text syncTime="2016.750" offset="8193233">Yes, sir, southwestern Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.202" offset="8203055">There are approximately seven mineral producing counties in southwestern Indiana, and the rest of the state is essentially non mineral producing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.827" offset="8245582">This oil and gas and coal development has occurred in really three phases for oil and perhaps two phases for coal, and it's been over a period of about three generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.270" offset="8307336">Determining the ownership of land and interests in land from the public records, as I'm sure some of you are aware, is a difficult, time consuming and very expensive job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.846" offset="8365641">In my county, I have concluded from my own estimates that probably 15 % or 48,000 acres may be affected by severed mineral claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.587" offset="8420603">And if I project this throughout the state, I'm of the opinion at least that probably 336,000 acres or 1 % of the entire state is affected by these types of severed mineral claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.346" offset="8479639">So that it is, you can see, a rather localized problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.798" offset="8493432">In my opinion, the total number of claimants; that is, persons, affected by this act throughout the state may be as many as 40,000, and perhaps 10,000 have had their rights extinguished under the act through their own failure to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.529" offset="8568351">So I hope that this gives you an idea at least of what I consider to be the size of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.183" offset="8594996">For the most part, these claims have been treated as valueless until they've been developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.020" offset="8622372">They've not been assessed for taxes and estates have been settled in which they have not been accounted for, they are not referred to in the preparation of persons' wills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.209" offset="8663123">So that after a generation or two or three, we have a situation in which the interests become very intricately fractionalized and very difficult to track down as a matter of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.885" offset="8721847">So this is the situation in which the General Assembly sought to construct a legislative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.789" offset="8745461">That remedy, needless to say, had to be effective and efficient and should not have been unduly harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.443" offset="8772002">We think that the Legislature has done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.645" offset="8784854">It may not be the proper answer for all states, but we think it's a proper answer for Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.799" offset="8809409">The mineral claimants have relied on the Pennsylvania Coal Company case, stating that the act effects a taking without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.707" offset="8865102">We think that the act has provided a means whereby any claimant can preserve his interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.211" offset="8887149">It's a simple and inexpensive means; he can simply file once each 20 years periodically, and he loses nothing if he complies with the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.834" offset="8933543">If you will, in the words of this Court, the act has simply taken a single strand of this bundle of rights; that is, the single right to hold that interest perpetually in the future without a corresponding duty or obligation to periodically keep the public records up to date by making a re recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.934" offset="9021941">We think that the act in this regard and this case are similar, for example, to the Eagle-Relick case, where I believe it was Mr. Justice Brennan who suggested that the appellants in that case were attempting to compel the government to regulate by purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.815" offset="9125491">We think this case falls in that category so far as the taking question is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2506.703" offset="10153043">I think that probably the central issue in this case is just that; whether or not the incorporation of a traditional grace period in this type of law is still a constitutionally acceptable method of making the law work retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.671" offset="10252936">In connection with that central issue, I would like to discuss the early dormant bank account cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.711" offset="10293060">Three of them have been cited, Security Bank v. California, Anderson National Bank v. Luckett and Standard Oil v. New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.899" offset="10329840">In the Security Bank and Standard Oil cases, the act provided for an adjudication, a final adjudication of abandonment of these bank accounts, and at the same time provided for a... more or less simultaneously provided for... a seizure of the bank accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.682" offset="10420955">The court in these two cases was dealing with not the depositor himself, but with the bank who naturally wanted to keep the windfall, wanted to appropriate the windfall for itself rather than turn it over to the state, and was arguing that it would be placed in double jeopardy if it had to give up the deposit without some kind of good notice to the depositor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.451" offset="10544044">The court held that a simple newspaper publication was adequate for a notice to the depositor, so far as protection to the bank from double jeopardy was concerned because it was an In Rem proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.479" offset="10604126">And I believe, certainly in the Security Bank case and I believe also in the Standard Oil case, the court did not decide any issues of constitutionality between the depositor himself and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.902" offset="10661909">I think those cases were cases wherein adjudication was provided for, a court adjudication, and the court simply held that notice by publication was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.896" offset="10717811">The Luckett case was a bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.581" offset="10728573">In that case, the portion of the act which was appealed from only involved a transfer of custody of the deposit from the bank to the state through an administrative proceeding by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.494" offset="10808194">In that case, the holding of the court especially indicated that all of us, or all persons who deposit money in banks in the state make those deposits with notice of the conditions which the state imposes by law upon those deposits, and that we must be presumed to have notice that under certain circumstances the surrender of our bank accounts to the state may be compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.530" offset="10932328">The court went on to hold that so far as the seizure of the property itself was concerned, the in rem matter, that the posting of a notice on the courthouse door was a sufficient form of notice to give to provide administrative jurisdiction to the seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.943" offset="11322075">While we're on that subject I would simply argue to the Court that not one of those cases, nor any other case, has ever held that an administrative or judicial proceeding is a necessary element of due process in a law affecting property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.009" offset="11418310">In this case the appellants argue for notice of extinguishment of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.999" offset="11454255">Well certainly, notice would be of no value to them unless they had the opportunity to do something about it after the notice were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.270" offset="11487378">Title puritive legislation characteristically has not done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.908" offset="11509843">It relies on independent remedies such as ejectment and quiet title proceedings, and we think there are some practical reasons for that and I'd like to mention just two or three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.947" offset="11554043">First, there is a great difficulty in identifying and locating who are the persons who would be... to whom the act would be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.505" offset="11596256">We can't send a copy of the general laws to every citizen, and if we did that still wouldn't provide him with any realistic notice of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.427" offset="11627917">Secondly, if these people could be identified and located, who has the motivation to do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.764" offset="11657278">Certainly not the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.880" offset="11665742">The state has no obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.232" offset="11675146">Certainly not the owner of the servient interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.584" offset="11684550">Why would that person who had the estate which was subservient, why would he be interested in providing notice to someone who was away and who had left his property and advise him that he should come back and do something to preserve it and take advantage of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.026" offset="11750379">There simply is no logic that a statute of that type would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.580" offset="11772531">And finally, the public policy is as well served by the extinguishment of the right as by any other result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.388" offset="11815789">Therefore, we think that there have been good reasons for the simple use of grace periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.225" offset="11847136">The statute is enacted, a grace period is allowed, and people are presumed after a certain period of time to have had sufficient interest in a property to care for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.217" offset="11899172">This philosophy and reasoning of course has been annunciated many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.288" offset="11923414">Personally, I like the view by Justice McKenna in a relatively old case, Ballard v. Hunter, that's 204 US at 262, and if I may, I'm going to quote just a little bit of his philosophy concerning this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.850" offset="11997706">He says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.166" offset="11998960">"The law cannot give personal notice of its provisions or proceedings to everyone. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.650" offset="12020903">"Of what concerns or may concern their real estate, men usually keep informed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.704" offset="12041069">"And on that probability the law may frame its proceedings. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.673" offset="12056952">"Indeed, must frame them and assume the care of proper to be universal if it would give efficiency to many of its exercises. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.031" offset="12094359">I have two further points that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.916" offset="12113899">I won't argue the contract impairment theory because the opponent does not argue it and we simply feel that it is a slight regulatory impairment, and the same reasoning applies as applies with regard to the taking issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.043" offset="12186415">The remaining matter that I'd like to discuss just briefly is equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.435" offset="12236047">In the briefs, we think the appellants' equal protection arguments are strained if not a little misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.891" offset="12269798">The Section 5 of the act has not one but four requirements; all of which are equally important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.147" offset="12302816">It requires, number one, that the owner have had ten or more interests in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.782" offset="12325386">Number two, that he had made a diligent effort to preserve those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.185" offset="12343045">Number three, that he had, in fact, preserved some interests in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.989" offset="12362167">And number four, that his failure to preserve was through inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.410" offset="12387871">We think it fair to say that the legislature could have concluded and reasonably so that a person who has ten or more interests in the same county probably owns them as a block, and probably acquired them for the purpose of development and probably would, in fact, develop these rights rather than simply hold and speculate on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.977" offset="12494137">We think the legislature could have concluded that one holding ten or more interests might have a significantly higher risk of inadvertently losing one or more than one through a mis filing or an error in filing, a clerical misfeasance of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.372" offset="12571773">And we think that the legislature could have concluded that such an error might bring on a very significant loss, or a more significant loss, to someone who held a lost of interests in a block as opposed to someone who held only one or very few scattered interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.217" offset="13311143">Those persons who have not, will be considered as unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.685" offset="13332981">And accordingly, we think that this objective standard, together with the filing alternative and the incorporation of the grace period to cover the retroactive situation entitles this law to be treated as a constitutional exercise of the regulatory power of the state, and that the decision of the Indiana Supreme Court on this issue should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. John L. Carroll</label>
            <text syncTime="3340.227" offset="13487208">Two more comments, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.012" offset="13498284">One is we somehow have put this case based upon expediency, and I don't think we're going to make... should not make constitutional judgments about what is expedient on the matter of whether we're going to give notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.873" offset="13561709">Counsel has said that the act is going to determine who is known and who is unknown as an owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.563" offset="13596505">I submit that Section 6 of the act is an answer to the questions which are raised, because it will clarify and protect your recording statute, which he says this is; it will put on the record those that are known or unknown; and if you read Section 6, it is a perfect answer to procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.679" offset="13688978">The only problem with Section 6 is it only applies if you have ten or more interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.583" offset="13712593">Had it applied to all of the interests, we would not be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.569" offset="13736521">This is a statute which, by its nature, does not treat people who have less than ten interests fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.942" offset="13774033">It was designed to terminate their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.060" offset="13786467">But if you look at Section 6 you have a perfect answer to how it should have been done on a constitutional basis and protect everybody, be they rich, the poor, the large, the small owner, put the interests of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.885" offset="13841847">Because if they don't come forward after the notice, then you can assume the surface owner is the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.956" offset="13862118">If they do come forward, then they have their interest of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.074" offset="13874552">The statute does not do that, and it does not do that because its intent is to extinguish that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.577" offset="13900570">Thank you.</text>
