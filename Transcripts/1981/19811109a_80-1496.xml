            <label>Mr. Theodore R. Boehm</label>
            <text syncTime="50.839" offset="348415">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case raises the question whether the Indiana judgments relating to the rehabilitation of UNAC, as the insurance company involved in this case is colloquially called, are entitled to full faith and credit in North Carolina as a result of the procedures that were implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.096" offset="437440">There are two judgments of the Indiana Court that UNAC submits are entitled to full faith and credit, and preclude relitigation of the issues that the Respondents seek to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.731" offset="491984">The history of this proceeding started in 1974, when the Indiana Department of Insurance, pursuant to a statutory mandate to take over the operations of a failing insurance company organized under Indiana law, did just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.129" offset="565545">As a result, pursuant to the Indiana statute, the Indiana Insurance Commissioner, as rehabilitator, became in possession of the business and assets of UNAC.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.422" offset="614760">That is the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.843" offset="620402">Subsequent to that time, a notice was sent out by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.120" offset="669512">The first notice that went out in 1975 was a Rule 23(B)(3) notice with which this Court is fully familiar, because Indiana trial procedure is exactly the same as federal trial procedure in this respect, and just about exactly at the same time that the Indiana Commissioner took over UNAC, UNAC was sued in two class actions, one in state court in Illinois and one in federal court in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.329" offset="754358">The state court in Illinois case was removed to federal court in Illinois, and each case was then stayed pursuant initially to an injunction issued by the Indiana court and then ultimately by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.339" offset="810365">The class plaintiffs in those two lawsuits then intervened in the Indiana proceeding, and those class plaintiffs were ultimately certified as class plaintiffs on behalf of all policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.053" offset="857280">The claims they were asserting were essentially that UNAC had defrauded the policyholders into entering into the policyholder relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.877" offset="892494">So, the first thing that went out was a Rule 23(B)(3) notice with respect to those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.735" offset="916004">It also explicitly told the policyholders that whether or not you opt out of the class pursuant to Rule 23(B)(3), you may ultimately be bound by a plan of rehabilitation in your capacity as a policyholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.901" offset="972637">We don't know at this time whether there will be a plan of rehabilitation, but if there is one, you are in court in Indiana in your policyholder capacity, irrespective of whether you want these plaintiffs to represent you in prosecuting these fraud claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.099" offset="1033450">So, there are two jurisdictional hooks, if you will, operating on this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.971" offset="1052885">No North Carolina policyholder opted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.531" offset="1067200">As a result, all of the North Carolina policyholders were in court in Indiana, both as class plaintiffs and as policyholders.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="240.606" offset="1107429">If one had opted out, would we have a different situation?</text>

          <turn speaker="theodore_r_boehm" startTime="243.730" stopTime="318.418">
            <label>Mr. Theodore R. Boehm</label>
            <text syncTime="243.730" offset="1119968">Well, we would have a different situation with respect to one issue, but not as to the fundamental issue that UNAC relies on, which is that qua policyholders, the policyholders are bound by the plan of rehabilitation, which is entitled to full faith and credit in all states once entered as a judicial decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.286" offset="1190185">There is a second, if you will, fall-back position that UNAC has that they are also bound as non-opting out plaintiffs by a settlement of their class claims as well, but that raises another whole complex of issues as to the nature of a multi-state Rule 23(B)(3) claim, and how the plaintiffs relate to the state of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.103" offset="1293421">There are cases that hold, and they are cited in our brief... the Kansas Supreme Court Shutts case is the leading one, that holds that a plaintiff who is a member of a class is in court and can be bound even though he is not a resident of the state and has no other jurisdictional connection with the state, but that issue is only reached in this case if you should hold, which we submit would be incorrect, that UNAC's plan of rehabilitation cannot bind the policyholders as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.789" offset="1468232">The North Carolina Guaranty Association intervened at the point after the class was certified, and after the time for opting out had expired, but before any plan of rehabilitation had been implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.483" offset="1538972">The North Carolina Guaranty Association, as you know, is here in its capacity as assignee of the policyholders' claims by operation of the North Carolina statutory framework, which makes them liable to make good on the policyholders but also gives them whatever rights it gives the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.819" offset="8036252">Indeed, there are two cases in North Carolina, one a federal court case interpreting North Carolina law, and the second a very recent North Carolina Supreme Court case that specifically says that these deposits are a trust, and they are not an asset of the insolvent insurer, and they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the domiciliary insolvency proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.934" offset="11700814">As I understand it, the rehabilitation proceeding has modified the rights of the policyholders so that, to take an example, a claim for a $1,000 injury before the rehabilitation proceeding might now only be worth $700.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.325" offset="11830276">And doesn't that in turn mean that the likelihood that the fund may be exhausted has changed because the obligations that it might have to satisfy have been reduced?</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.432" offset="11854727">So, inevitably, has not the possibility that that fund will be used in certain ways have been changed by what happened in Indiana?</text>
