            <text syncTime="5.954" offset="101154">This case here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri involves the validity of rules governing the advertisement by lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.917" offset="141069">State supreme courts, aided by the organized bar, adopt rules or Canons of Professional conduct that now include regulation of advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.681" offset="192060">The Missouri rule had issue in this case specifies 10 categories of information that may be included in an advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.143" offset="233961">It limits the language that a lawyer may use in identifying the areas of his practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.913" offset="261024">And among other provisions, it allows the mailing of professional announcement cards only to lawyers, clients, former clients, personal friends and relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.799" offset="312537">There also is a restriction against identifying oneself as a member of the Bar of this Court or of the Bar of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.046" offset="361543">The Missouri Disciplinary Committee charged their lawyer with violation by the advertising that he published in telephone directory and by virtue of cost it was sent out by this lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.925" offset="433118">The Missouri Supreme Court agreed that there were violations of the rules and held however that the rules were perfectly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.313" offset="470630">It issued a private reprimand for the violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.801" offset="488602">In Bates against Arizona, we held that advertising by lawyers is a form of commercial speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.873" offset="536877">We made clear however, that misleading advertisement is not protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.777" offset="560491">Moreover, we reiterate today that the potential for deception and confusion is particularly strong in the context of advertising for professional services.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.631" offset="611900">In this case, although the advertising violated the Missouri rules, there was no finding that it was inherently misleading or that the public had in fact been mislead.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.733" offset="664354">We conclude therefore that the Missouri rules, as applied in this case, cannot be squared with the Courtâ€™s decision in Bates against Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.632" offset="703956">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri.</text>
