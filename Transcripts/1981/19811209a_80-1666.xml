            <text syncTime="15.760" offset="198971">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the narrow issue of the constitutionality under the establishment clause of an exemption provision in Minnesota's Charitable Solicitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.089" offset="280264">The provision in question exempts from the financial disclosure requirements otherwise applicable to charitable organizations in the Act those religious organizations and societies which solicit more than half of their contributions from their members and from their affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.551" offset="354139">The appeal presents the question whether the establishment clause prohibits a state from tailoring a regulatory program to allow coverage of some religious organizations where the application of the law to religious organizations is based on criteria unrelated to matters of religious belief or dogma.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.678" offset="430625">Plaintiffs in this case are the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, Incorporated, and four of its members.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.006" offset="707941">The state seeks to protect contributors from fraud and from misrepresentation by those organizations as to the identity of the organization, the purpose of the organization, and the use to which funds are put by that organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.967" offset="779830">Through a series of six exemptions, Minnesota has determined that disclosure is not always necessary to effectuate the state's objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.156" offset="816506">One of these six exemptions is the exemption for religious organizations and societies that solicit more than half of their contributions from their members and affiliates, and the narrow issue here is the application of the establishment clause to that provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.461" offset="1089747">It's not a fact, but I think it is a mathematical certainty, because the fraternal and patriotic organizations that raise any of their money from the general public outside their membership lose their exemption.</text>

            <label>Mr. Larry Salustro</label>
            <text syncTime="310.108" offset="1376362">Well, the reason that is advanced by the state is that the state of Minnesota wants to be more careful about extending its regulatory program to religious organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.175" offset="1476568">Where the state interest in those organizations is small, then it is concerned about extending its regulatory program to fraternal organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.531" offset="1518051">There are... we have a very different interest in religious organizations among themselves in this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.887" offset="1555458">The purpose of the program is to provide information to donors and contributors who don't have that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.159" offset="1584506">There are a wide range of kinds of charitable... of religious charitable organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.812" offset="1611151">There are religious charitable organizations that solicit exclusively from members of the public, 100 percent from the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.816" offset="1643125">As far as our interest in providing information to donors that don't have it, we have a very great interest in disclosure by those organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.107" offset="1688369">On the other hand, there are organizations that solicit only from members who are intimately familiar with the finances of the organization, at the other end of the spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.082" offset="1728284">We have much less interest in requiring disclosure, public disclosure from those organizations because the members who are the donors of those organizations already have that information available to them or can get it.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.411" offset="1817518">That is, a religious organization has all the protection of the speech and press clauses, I would assume, and in addition to that it has the protection of the religion clauses which are not necessarily available to fraternal and patriotic organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.408" offset="1905499">What I was trying to explain is that we have a different... we have a relatively lower interest in some religious organizations and the exemption provision is different because we want to leave organizations alone where our interest is so small.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.202" offset="1984702">There is no doubt that there are many cases by this Court, many charitable solicitation cases by this Court, and what we are talking about here is solicitation from the general public, and in a number of those cases, the Court has... the Court has looked at disclosure type programs and distinguished the kind of regulation that disclosure type programs have from prohibitory regulation, and in the Cantwell case and in the Schaumburg case, and in some other cases where the Court has looked at this particular question, it has determined that disclosure kind of regulation does not have to meet the same tests as regulation which has the effect of directly prohibiting organizations and members of organizations from soliciting contributions from the general public.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.839" offset="2843295">That kind of decision takes... takes into consideration that the state has some leeway in treating religious organizations somewhat better, somewhat more liberally, somewhat more at a distance than other kinds of organizations, and the Court said in the Walz case and the Court said in some other cases that there is some leeway for the state to do that without necessarily violating the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.127" offset="2972444">So, that criteria of religious organization is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.162" offset="2992611">The second question is, once it is determined that there will be a religious exemption, how should the exemption be structured, and in Minnesota's case, what we have done here is used a secular criteria to structure the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.172" offset="3048617">The criteria has nothing to do with religion, with religious values, with the content of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.493" offset="3073904">The value is purely secular, whether the organization solicits from the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.146" offset="3100548">It is not only secular, it is tied to the purposes of the Act, which is providing information to people that don't have information that receive solicitations from charitable organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.939" offset="7435621">And the statute, Your Honors, arms the licenser with broad investigative powers and provides for license suspension, revocation, receivership, criminal prosecution for enforcing this law and this regulatory scheme which surely imposes burdens, substantial burdens on churches, burdens which simply aren't remote or de minimis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.950" offset="14879683">The argument has been made here that our provision, the criteria has to be supported by a factual inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.675" offset="14930570">What was done below was, on summary judgment, this provision was declared facially unconstitutional as to all religious organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.399" offset="14969544">It is not up to us on their motion for summary judgment to supply facts that support our criterion and the 50 percent part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.338" offset="15009251">Furthermore, in their brief, they have acknowledged that this statute has a rational basis, on Page 23 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.742" offset="15038926">That is the standard that comes out of Gillette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.444" offset="15049688">If there is a secular criteria, if there is no religious gerrymandering in the exemption, all we need is a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.431" offset="15073616">There is a secular criterion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.300" offset="15081140">There is no gerrymander here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.916" offset="15087618">And there isn't a gerrymander because of these references to legislative history and what the Catholics thought and what the Moonies were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.156" offset="15116562">In fact, if you go through that material you will find there was a Catholic organization, the Pallatine Mission, that was the reason for this legislation, because they were a direct mail organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.944" offset="15159716">There is no attempt here to separate organizations by who is controversial and who is not, who is traditional and who is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.915" offset="15183540">Controversial organizations like the Church of Scientology, the Jonestown Peoples' Temple, those organizations are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.771" offset="15211020">Traditional organizations like the Pallatines or Billy Graham Crusade, those organizations are not exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.758" offset="15234948">This does not cut across controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.627" offset="15246442">This is not a religious gerrymander.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.993" offset="15251876">We only need a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.427" offset="15257623">Thank you very much.</text>
