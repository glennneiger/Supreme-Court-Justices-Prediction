            <text syncTime="78.266" offset="438155">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.737" offset="456023">The issue before the Court today is whether there is federal habeas corpus jurisdiction to challenge a termination of parental rights order where the challenge is based upon the claim that the state court lacked constitutional power to order the children into state custody because the statute under which it purported to act is federally unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.737" offset="572007">A related question is whether the Petitioner, as the mother who gave birth to the children who are now wards of the state and nurtured them through their formative years, has standing to challenge on their behalf the allegedly unconstitutional order in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="131.949" offset="652882">The question is a little narrower, I thought: whether she can do it by way of habeas corpus in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.388" offset="678586">Is it not that narrow?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="martin_guggenheim" startTime="140.021" stopTime="370.952">
            <label>Mr. Martin Guggenheim</label>
            <text syncTime="140.021" offset="685169">Yes, related to the first question of whether there is federal habeas corpus jurisdiction, whether the Petitioner as the mother before the final order of the Pennsylvania courts has standing in the federal habeas action to bring this case on the children's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.099" offset="749431">This case does not present any question respecting the scope of federal review in such a habeas corpus action or concerning the relitigation of facts or the best interests of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.109" offset="809512">The court below, the en banc Third Circuit, ruled in a split decision, two plurality decisions of that court, against Petitioner; four interlocking, interweaving, but we would submit mistaken bases for the conclusion that jurisdiction does not lie in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.294" offset="930198">The first is that the mother does not have legal capacity to bring the action on behalf of their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.781" offset="956216">The second is that the children are not in custody within the meaning of the federal habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.185" offset="985786">The other two grounds are policy grounds: the fear that according such jurisdiction would necessarily lead to including intra-family disputes, such as child custody disputes in the ordinary separation of a family divorce context; and the fourth, general federalism concerns and implications respecting the appropriate role of a federal court in determining constitutional norms in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.708" offset="1127893">We submit that there clearly is jurisdiction in this case, that that jurisdiction derives from the literal language and the purpose and meaning of Sections 2241 and Section 2254 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.771" offset="1208141">The first issue for the court is whether the children are in custody within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.679" offset="1251817">We submit that this Court has resolved that question numerous times in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.166" offset="1277731">Historically, of course, it was the Act of 1867 which broadly expanded the scope of federal habeas jurisdiction to all persons in custody of the state in violation of the laws, treaties or Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.313" offset="1358293">In 1886 this Court in Wales against Whitney recognized that the term habeas, that the term custody, is a term that applies to a great variety of restraints for which it is used to get relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.643" offset="1443661">Confinement under civil and criminal process may be so relieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.762" offset="1460066">Indeed, wives restrained by husbands, children withheld from their proper parent or guardian, persons held under arbitrary custody by private individuals, may all become proper subjects of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.688" offset="1515759">Now, of course the question respecting the definition and breadth of custody does not address solely or conclude finally whether or not federal habeas corpus lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.912" offset="1568735">But it clearly shows that the term "custody" in the statute is easily met by children in this case who are wards of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.122" offset="1837587">In the brief we make the point that there may well be equitable reasons to limit habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.978" offset="1873009">I think... it's a complicated answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.311" offset="1882309">I think that jurisdiction does exist to make the challenge, but I think that a court may determine that the children are no longer in custody in violation of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.203" offset="1941868">Even on the jurisdiction, after it made an inquiry into where the children were at that moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.491" offset="1962975">And the reason is, Wales against Whitney, of course, as broad as the language is that I've just cited back in 1886 was, if not reversed by this Court in Jones against Cunningham, clearly broadly expanded in Jones against Cunningham, and that the test in the twentieth century has been that a person must be subject to restraints not shared by the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.058" offset="2073316">There can be no question that children who are state wards, children who are parentless, children who don't have relatives, children who are subject to the discretion of the state to be moved about within the state's care, as this Court recognized in the Smith against OFFER case, are persons who are restrained of their liberty in a manner which is not shared by the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.078" offset="2185329">However, Justice Rehnquist, it may be... and this case does not raise that question... that once the children have been adopted they no longer meet the test of Jones against Cunningham, because they are no longer subject to these peculiar restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.689" offset="2251785">It may also be that they do still meet the test, and I would commend to this Court the Eighth Circuit's opinion in Syrovatka against Erlich, which is cited in the brief, in which that court ruled that children who had been adopted already were not within custody--</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.742" offset="8751991">I think that it brings up a question that certainly after a termination there's a realignment of interests, and in a real sense perhaps a child needs a voice in that termination decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.750" offset="8800056">The argument we would make is that in delinquency cases, which certainly the Court has recognized through habeas corpus, the parent and the child would share an interest either in a release from probation or release from even the supervision of a probation officer, or in an extreme case the child being held in an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.015" offset="8893156">The child's need of continuity conflicts with this absence of finality when a termination is questioned and, as in this case, appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.971" offset="8932967">Now, in Pennsylvania under the new 1980 statute representation through a guardian ad litem is given to a child in an involuntary termination matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.381" offset="8986570">Heretofore, and certainly in this case, the agency was overseeing the interests of the child in stability and a long-term foster care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.236" offset="9025963">The second question would deal, of course, directly with habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.294" offset="9074237">The stamp of criminal sanctions certainly pervades the overwhelming majority of habeas corpus petitions which are filed in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.482" offset="9114988">Indeed, Attorney General William French Smith noted that last year alone there were 7800 habeas petitions filed in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.957" offset="9156888">These issues in regards to state criminal matters indicate the judicial and social perception of the scope of the great writ, sweeps aside, of course, the doctrine of res judicata, with no restriction or perhaps even a statute of limitation in which the petition can be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.037" offset="9241212">The statute looks to the protection of individuals against the erosion of their private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.941" offset="9264826">Certainly, it provides relief from unlawful custody, as was noted in the several criminal cases discussed by Mr. Guggenheim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.296" offset="9302234">Simply stated, a single federal judge can overturn the highest court of a state as it relates to constitutional issues and the direct facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.371" offset="9346537">The question is whether the restraints are suffered by the public generally, which was discussed in the Hensley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.044" offset="9381228">Congress found it appropriate to tailor this present habeas corpus statute to meet an existing need and concern back in 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.018" offset="9429084">It can be justifiably argued that a major shifting in interpretation such as advocated by Marjorie Lehman perhaps should await some Congressional thought on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.492" offset="9479031">Indeed, I think there's been some suggestions made by Attorney General Smith that the habeas corpus area should be approached and discussed by Congress and decided what direction they opt for here in our common age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.954" offset="9548830">Justices Brennan, Marshall and O'Connor in the Fair Assessment case talked about that, subject only to constitutional restraints, Congress exclusively determines the jurisdiction of federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.380" offset="9610583">The Pennsylvania statute was found not... was found constitutional back in 1978, and that has been embedded in the law since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.038" offset="9661156">Simply put, the wrongful restraint which is talked about in habeas corpus is simply not the circumstance when we're dealing with rights termination matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.996" offset="9709013">Parents' interests remain most strong in preserving the family relationship after termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.316" offset="9734299">As we've talked, the child's right is in an end to that litigation, the right to then be accepted into a stable home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.839" offset="9772438">The Lehman boys have stood in much the same status as other children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.175" offset="9793754">They are looking to... they are subject, of course, to parental guidance, care, control, which is necessary for their physical or mental well-being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.448" offset="9834818">Habeas corpus by its very nature is intrusive in nature in a dual system of state and federal courts and is uninhibited by traditional rules of finality and federalism, and should be confined to cases of special urgency, such as Hensley talked.</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.856" offset="12696480">Basically, and for the complication that there was an as-applied and a facial attack in the case, and only one of them would be cognizable on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.997" offset="12749039">This is a challenge to the constitutionality of a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.116" offset="12765548">It is, in Justice Powell's words in Stone against Powell, going to the heart of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.472" offset="12798985">It's not an extra question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.107" offset="12809434">In Justice Stevens' words in Rose against Lundy, this is his fourth kind of habeas claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.661" offset="12831690">It goes to the validity of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.112" offset="12841512">This Court has never countenanced the denial of Congressionally imposed jurisdiction for policy or prudential reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.718" offset="12879964">Stone is the limit of this Court interpreting what the meaning of "in violation of the Constitution" was, to say that the illegal search didn't meet that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.126" offset="12929597">But it has never gone beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.895" offset="12936598">And finally, this Court... the court below, the majority of the Third Circuit judges believed that federal review was appropriate and was necessary, but peculiarly, thought it was better to reserve the federal issues, contrary to Congress' desire of exhaustion in the England type context, to reserve; in the first place, litigate through the state court, then go into federal court in 1983 and say the statute's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.295" offset="13046208">I submit that is not respecting basic principles of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.080" offset="13065329">That is showing a greater disregard for the intelligence and concern of state judges than to require, as the habeas statute does, full exhaustion of the remedies in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.357" offset="13122485">And finally, although I won't refer to a dissent to rely on it solely, all of the Justices of this Court in the Santosky case recognized that federal courts should not and may not blink at unconstitutional statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.735" offset="13203987">We submit that this is one and that this Court should remand to the federal court for a full hearing.</text>
