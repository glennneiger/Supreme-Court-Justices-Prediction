            <text syncTime="94.026" offset="535244">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case is here on certiorari to review what the lower courts have characterized as a controlling question of law on which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.471" offset="596997">The United States District Court denied our motion for partial summary judgment on the question of a violation, on the ground that the legality of Respondent's agreed upon fee schedules was to be judged under the rule of reason rather than per se rule.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth R. Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="137.710" offset="709951">To be sure, and we subsequently filed, Justice Rehnquist, a motion for partial summary judgment on the question of violation, based on the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.456" offset="748925">That motion was filed in support of our papers for a preliminary injunction, and both of those questions were before the Ninth Circuit, both the 1292b petition for interlocutory appeal and the appeal of the denial of summary judgment motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.288" offset="856236">Summary judgment had been denied by the District Court under both the rule of reason theory and per se theory, and our request for continuation of the preliminary injunction was also denied under the theory that it did not violate either the per se standard and there was not enough evidence to show that it violated the rule of reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.734" offset="942023">But didn't Judge Coppel give you leave to renew your motion for summary judgment on either standard after more discovery had taken place, just that there wasn't enough facts in the record to say what the effect of the plan was?</text>

            <text syncTime="222.832" offset="1050483">He did in fact deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.395" offset="1056752">I think the question this Court has to decide is how much additional discovery need be taken and on what additional issues must discovery be taken if at all before reaching a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.905" offset="1110774">I think, as we talk in the briefs, there is talk in the papers about disputed facts, about the desire for further discovery, but I think the facts, Justice Rehnquist, necessary for this Court's decision are clear and simple, undisputed, and have been established by Respondent's own Rule 36 admissions and the affidavits Respondents themselves have prepared and submitted and filed with the lower courts, and those facts are really only three.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.844" offset="1242535">One, Respondents are trade associations of competing physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.076" offset="1271479">Two, as part of their activities, Respondents formulate and prepare lists of prices covering the range of services that they perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.930" offset="1334904">Three, as part of their function, the Respondents prepare minimum standards which they utilize in endorsing pre-paid health plans, whether insurance health plans or by third party payors such as the state of Arizona, which reimburses health care plans as an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.888" offset="1434692">For an insurer or an employer to receive Respondents' endorsement, the third party payor must agree to accept these minimum standards, one of which is the agreement to pay Respondent's members up to the amount set forth in the agreed upon fee schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.501" offset="1545138">In return, in return, Respondents' members agree not to bill any more than what is set forth in those fee schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.887" offset="1594666">Those facts, Justice Rehnquist, are established beyond cavil.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.699" offset="8749918">In this case, it is stipulated that almost all of them do charge the maximum, and it is also stipulated that every year they hike the maximum further and further, which raises the costs of the insurance companies that do business with the foundations, and ultimately redounds to the detriment of the consumers that pay for the premiums on the insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.002" offset="8839152">Our position is that it is harmful to consumers, and I will elaborate that point in the course of my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2205.660" offset="8981781">I would like first to describe the legal standard which governs in a case of this kind, and then explain why Arizona was entitled to summary judgment under that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.546" offset="9025353">Ever since this Court's ruling in Socony-Vacuum, it has been black letter law that competitors may not combine to restrain independent decision-making on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.588" offset="9069448">As the Court stated in Socony, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.993" offset="9083136">"Any combination which tampers with price structures is engaged in an unlawful activity. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.694" offset="9109885">And in the unanimous decision of this Court in Kiefer-Stewart, the Court reaffirmed that an agreement among competitors fixing maximum prices is subject to the per se prohibition just like a uniform price agreement or a minimum price agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.780" offset="9174251">In Professional Engineers, the Court summarized its past opinions concisely by stating that any agreement that interferes with the setting of price by free market forces is unlawful on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.167" offset="9227750">Of course, the per se rule must be confined by the scope of its rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.523" offset="9249275">It applies to so-called naked restraints which cut off competitive or independent decision-making by independent rivals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.145" offset="9283756">It does not ordinarily apply to agreements on price which are necessary components of joint productive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.595" offset="9309565">This distinction is illustrated by a familiar example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.704" offset="9325970">If a group of attorneys gets together and establishes a schedule of fees, this is a per se violation as the Court held in the Goldfarb case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2303.058" offset="9371319">And under Kiefer-Stewart, maximum fees are subject to the same pet se prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.149" offset="9391694">But if that same group of lawyers gets together and establishes a law firm, they may agree on the prices which they charge their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.976" offset="9423041">Members of firms are not expected to compete against one another or to attempt to divert business from each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.848" offset="9450522">Joint productive activity defends on cooperation rather than internal competition in an integrated business entity, such as a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.533" offset="9485317">Accordingly, the relevant inquiry in this case is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.985" offset="9503081">First, have competitors in fact entered into an agreement limiting their pricing, independence, and second, if they have, is that agreement an essential facet of joint productive activity, as in the case of a partnership or a merger of medical practices into a health maintenance organization?</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.976" offset="9579045">In this case, these questions can all be answered with dispatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.490" offset="9597121">In fact, all of the information that is needed to render a judgment on liability is contained in the foundation's very extensive admissions of fact which are on Pages 156 through 273 of the joint appendix in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.436" offset="9660860">Let me now summarize what the foundations have in fact admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.638" offset="9677683">The doctor members of the foundations vote by mail ballot on maximum fee schedules used to determine the fees which insurance companies pay them, and they agree to abide by those maximums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.367" offset="9728569">If an insurance company wishes to do business with the foundations, it must agree to pay the doctors up to the maximum which they have jointly prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.457" offset="9769007">The foundations have increased these maximums nearly on a yearly basis since they were formed in 1969 and 1971, and only 5 to 15 percent of the doctors in Maricopa Foundation bill less than the prescribed maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.748" offset="9830134">Significantly, when the foundations tried to identify issues of fact for trial, they did not suggest that the medical practices of their members were integrated into a partnership or a joint venture arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.147" offset="9883737">The undisputed fact is that the doctors here involved are hundreds of independent practitioners engaged in traditional fee for service medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.269" offset="9920204">Accordingly, their price fixing falls into the category of a naked restraint, and is not an essential facet of joint integrated medical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.141" offset="9959701">We note in this connection that the claims payment and review activities which the foundations carry on do not require that the doctors prescribe their prices, and the foundations have never made any contrary assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.557" offset="10013409">In a period in which everyone is vitally concerned with inflation in the health care industry, it may seem somewhat unusual for the government to argue that doctors should not ban together and prescribe maximum prices for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.693" offset="10069938">In fact, however, maximum price fixing is no cure for rising costs in the health care industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.909" offset="10094806">Maximum price fixing has many of the objectionable features of an ordinary price cartel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.455" offset="10268991">Our submission is that maximum price fixing has many of the objectionable features of an ordinary price cartel, and that is the reason this Court condemned it in Kiefer-Stewart as illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.123" offset="10311623">For example, if the doctors prescribe a maximum price of $1,000 for a particular operation, and most of them actually charge that maximum, as the record here shows, then the maximum has many of the features of a fixed uniform price, and since it is always in the power of the combination to raise the price, the so-called maximum is not a maximum at all, because it can be hiked at will by the doctors themselves, as this record clearly shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.345" offset="10424472">Moreover, this Court has never suggested that a professed goal of having reasonable prices is an excuse for price agreements among competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.916" offset="10502839">Arizona's point is that the agreement could be used to keep out other doctors through depression of the price, and it could be used to inflate the cost of health insurance through elevating the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.223" offset="10544008">It is the aggregation of power through the combination to do those two things that is illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.280" offset="10612240">It is the potential, as the Court pointed out in Trenton Potteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.919" offset="10634809">It is the aggregation of power to... which could be pressed to improper ends that Section 1 of the Sherman Act condemns as illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.775" offset="10670232">The aggregation of power in a price fixing combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.930" offset="10682875">This Court's... Let me illustrate the point that I was making a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.551" offset="10709311">If the foundations were permitted to enforce their own conception of a reasonable maximum price, there would be an inevitable tendency to adjust that price upwards to promote their own economic welfare, and as this Court emphasized in the Socony case, those who fixed reasonable prices today would fix unreasonable prices tomorrow, and any insurance company that wished to do business with the combination would be compelled to pay up to the fixed maximum price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.306" offset="10820383">I would also point out in this connection that although the foundation's claim that a maximum price is essential to contain medical costs, they fail to suggest a single reason why that maximum price needs to be prescribed by a combination of competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.565" offset="10885376">If in fact a maximum price is a useful feature in medical insurance plans, the maximum can be prescribed by individual insurers who pay for the medical services and who actually have an incentive to reduce medical expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.621" offset="10945667">That is the way the Blue Shield insurance policies operate throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.964" offset="10963012">The present price fixing scheme prevents individual insurers from obtaining competitively negotiated agreements with individual doctors, and interferes with their efforts to contain medical costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.489" offset="11017138">That is bad for the consumers, who pay for the insurance premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.909" offset="11034796">In short, this price fixing scheme poses a serious threat to competitive conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.251" offset="11060187">It can be enjoined without causing injury to any joint productive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.342" offset="11080458">In these circumstance, we submit, the per se rule is properly applied, and it is properly applied on the record which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.291" offset="11120269">As this Court pointed out in the White Motors case some time ago, it is perfectly appropriate to use summary judgment procedures in a horizontal price fixing case, and it referred to the Kiefer-Stewart decision, which is a maximum price fixing case, in making that observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.348" offset="11184530">For there reasons, we respectfully submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.275" offset="11292259">Would the Blue Shield program be illegal if Blue Shield specified the schedule and if every doctor that participated in the program agreed not to charge in excess of the schedule?</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.336" offset="11456517">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a summary judgment case, and because of that I am going to spend a great deal of time talking about the facts and the lack of facts that are undisputed and are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.312" offset="11528406">First, I would point out that Respondents have submitted a statement of material facts in issue precluding summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.325" offset="11560485">It is found in the appendix, at Page 123, and I think it deals with many of the issues which I am going to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.401" offset="11588697">Most important, there is no fee schedule, no fee schedule as Petitioner and as the United States have used that term today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.068" offset="11627358">The evidence shows that there is no agreement concerning what doctors charge patients, and the District Court so ruled, and that is right in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.032" offset="11663303">What the Petitioner is calling a fee schedule is really an agreement by members of a medical foundation which only affects medical foundation endorsed insurance, and it is an agreement to accept the maximum reimbursement levels as payment in full in the event that the doctor bills the patient more than that maximum reimbursement level and the patient is medical foundation insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.820" offset="11774375">Then the doctor will write off the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.208" offset="11787959">If the doctor is not a member of the foundation, then the doctor is free to charge the difference to the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.704" offset="11817947">This is accompanied by agreements by the members of the foundation to be bound by peer review, not to use the foundation to change the rates they bill their patients, not to discriminate in billing between foundation insured and non-insured patients, and it has absolutely no effect whatsoever without the additional component of an insurer voluntarily agreeing to participate in the program, and there is no evidence in the record that there is any ability to coerce insurers to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.111" offset="11959531">Indeed, the record is absolutely empty as to what the insurers really do in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.282" offset="11984295">All we can say, and this is very limited, is that in 1979 Maricopa Foundation, one of the Respondents, insured about 1,000 people out of a population of 1.5 million in Maricopa County, about 7 percent, and in 1978, Pima Foundation covered about 6,000 people, or about 1 percent of the population of Pima County, and in that same year, only 31 percent of the physicians in Pima County were members of Pima Foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.033" offset="12115221">So, it is not an organization which exercises any sort of dominance over delivery of medical care in the two areas where the Respondents are operating.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.899" offset="14426744">The insurer would like to accurately predict the costs of medical care because that enables the insurer to make better actuarial predictions, which means that it can lower its rates because it doesn't have to have a reserve to cover the unexpected, and it is worth pointing out that a big element in that unexpected is usually inflation, and the possibility of increases in the costs of medical services which you can't tell in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.089" offset="14543459">You are writing insurance that covers a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.994" offset="14555058">You don't know what the cost of a particular procedure is going to be a year from now in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.806" offset="14574388">The insurer needs a mechanism to negotiate cost containment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3614.332" offset="14616498">He cannot go out and send his agents to negotiate individually with every one of the doctors in the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="5265.981" offset="21223074">I think a district judge does, but that the discretion has to take into account the experience and the theory and whether the precedents which deal with per se liability on price fixing are applicable and appropriate in this particular type of marketplace on the particular facts that are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.253" offset="21312099">In this case, the district court, if he has discretion, exercised it wisely, we believe, and we are just asking you to uphold that and to allow the proceedings to go back to their normal course, have discovery, and have a determination after appropriate discovery and after a full record.</text>
