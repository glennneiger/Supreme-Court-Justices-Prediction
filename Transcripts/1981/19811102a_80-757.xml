            <text syncTime="11.572" offset="184077">Mr. Hegarty, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Hegarty</label>
            <text syncTime="53.235" offset="350739">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, let me begin by going back to 1936, to the era that Justice Powell referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.458" offset="403715">In the Congressional debates, the Senate debate concerning the 1936 amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act, a decision of this Court was read into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.968" offset="457736">That decision had held that the pre-existing Act could not provide a remedy against someone who was accused of having manipulated the market because the statute was framed in terms of is manipulating, present tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.078" offset="526177">This Court said that the proceeding could not go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.632" offset="544358">It affirmed the lower court, which it so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.817" offset="553135">It said, and this, as I say, was read into the record, the entire decision by Justice Brandeis, a unanimous decision of this Court, to supply omissions transcends the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.806" offset="597021">I don't believe that the perception of the role of the Congress and of the judiciary in 1936 and earlier, and even since has been... has gone through the sea changes that are suggested by the Respondents and by the CFTC.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.620" offset="680300">Indeed, much mention has been made of Rigsby.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.607" offset="704228">In that decision, it seems to me, as I read it, that Justice Pitney was very, very careful to have two bases for his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.631" offset="740381">One indeed was for the use of the remedium, but immediately thereafter he said the inference is made irresistible by the language of the statute, and I don't think that is very different from Cort v. Ash, if one thinks about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.991" offset="801821">Now, the argument in the earlier case is different in two respects from the questions presented presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.664" offset="836512">That case involves a section of the Commodity Exchange Act, Section 4b, which is for the benefit quite plainly by claim of a customer and it provides that his broker may not defraud him.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.487" offset="887816">That language might suffice for the first factor in Cort.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.472" offset="907774">Representing a contract market, I am addressing different sections, Sections 5d, 5a(8), and perhaps 9b, which is the general criminal statute against manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.032" offset="962004">5d is the licensing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.083" offset="974125">It says that boards of trade will be designated as contract markets if they satisfy certain criteria, one of which is to have a system to prevent manipulation... not to prevent manipulation, but to have a system to prevent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.141" offset="1022399">5a(8) is prescriptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.259" offset="1034833">It says that one of the things the contract market must do is enforce its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.395" offset="1051447">These are quite patently for the general benefit of the... well, it certainly goes far beyond the futures market.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.151" offset="1082481">It goes to the cash market, as it is called, the production, the handling, the use of commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.570" offset="1112156">The other very significant distinction between the 4b question and the question posed as against a contract market is a practical distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.562" offset="1160117">It is a question of practical consequences, and implicit, if I can use the word in this general context, holding of the Second Circuit or the court below was that a cash trader, that is, a person not trading in the futures market at all, but holding cash potatoes, had a claim against the contract market because of an alleged failure on its part to act in an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.030" offset="1265965">That opens up, it seems to me, the picture of not only which we would have in the Securities Acts functioning on the trading in a particular security or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.539" offset="1319986">It goes beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.589" offset="1324166">It is trading in a futures contract, but then the impact of that trading, that alleged manipulation might have on the cash product.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.293" offset="1359065">In other words, manipulation in wheat in the Chicago Board of Trade, the price fixed in the Chicago Board of Trade is used, as they call it, for price discovery by those who are actually delivering wheat to mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.602" offset="1412251">This is, as Judge Mansfield said in dissent below, what is involved is literally hundreds of millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.208" offset="1446628">Now, I don't cite that in a kind of interorum way.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.510" offset="1463869">I cite it for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.362" offset="1471287">It seems to me that when the consequences are such, when the possible result is such, it bears very directly on whether one can assume that Congress intended such a result but chose not to say so, which after all is the fundamental question.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.203" offset="1526667">I regret that the Solicitor General's office did not choose to argue in this case, to deal with questions of that sort, although they briefed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.544" offset="1584032">Now, the three sections that interest the contract markets are Section 5d, as I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.464" offset="1611722">That was enacted in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.998" offset="1617782">At that time, a companion statute enacted the same month was the Packers and Stockyards Act, which provided both for reparations and private damages against the stockyard and others, and I think it is suggested that the two statutes go in tandem, and no such remedy is provided in the Commodity... as it was then called, the Grain Futures Act, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.329" offset="1707121">9b was enacted in 1936, and as I say, in Wallace against Cutten, a case which I quoted from, it was before Congress, very much before Congress at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.121" offset="1750275">5a(8), as I say, Subdivision a(8) was added to 5a in 1968, at a time when Congress did not enact a bill which would have provided an action against contract markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.194" offset="1802624">Now we come to 1974, and a unanimous panel of the Fifth Circuit said that the legislative history was emphatically equivocal in that that was not a sufficient basis to predicate a private right of action.</text>

            <label>Mr. William E. Hegarty</label>
            <text syncTime="455.919" offset="1961553">--That is what the court below said, Your Honor, but the Fifth Circuit thought that the evidence was dubious, if you will, that Congress as a whole had any awareness of the one decision, one appellate decision that upheld a cause of action against a contract market.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.483" offset="2035741">They said there was no evidence that Congress had approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.685" offset="2048593">In the opinion from the majority below, it was described as implicit approval by Congress, and I think to premise an implied right of action upon an implicit approval by Congress in emphatically equivocal legislative history piles too much on too shaky a foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.200" offset="2142634">In 1974, if you look at objective evidence again as to contract markets, they did not enact a private action against contract markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.240" offset="2182758">They did enact the reparations remedy from which contract markets are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.410" offset="2207522">They did specifically authorize the CFTC to bring injunction for suits in district courts against contract markets, and they added to the penalty provision the direction to the CFTC to consider whether the amount of the penalty would materially impair the contract market's ability to carry on its operations and duties, and I don't think a possible exposure to hundreds of millions of dollars could be said to be consistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.541" offset="2308042">If there was a dramatic overhaul of the statute in 1974, it is similar to that which occurred and was the subject of this Court's decision in City of Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.764" offset="2348897">There had been a federal common law cause of action for nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.816" offset="2365093">The Seventh Circuit had held here that there was a common law cause of action against contract markets, the one appellate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.470" offset="2387767">I think it would follow that such a contract... common law cause of action had been supplanted by the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.224" offset="2418696">Finally, let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.111" offset="2434265">The question posed is, is there a private right of action, is there an implied private right of action, but that is a very, very narrow question.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.383" offset="2471359">The question really should be, is there a private right of action having certain dimensions?</text>
            <text syncTime="589.037" offset="2494033">For example, there is no guidance whatsoever in this statute for a determination, as was present in the case of Ocville, as to what standard of liability should exist, what measure of culpability is required for this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.963" offset="2557668">If we go back to the District Court in this case, where negligence is alleged, I would move to dismiss on the grounds that bad faith had not been alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.688" offset="2604584">But I have no guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.804" offset="2613047">The District Court will have none It is too simplistic a question to ask whether a private right of action is implied, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.393" offset="2643454">I will say one final point, if I may, in answer to the question posed by Mr. Justice White earlier on.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.932" offset="2685563">I think there must be affirmative evidence to create the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.336" offset="2707193">We cannot invert the burden of inquiry, as occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.473" offset="2727777">I don't wish to intrude upon the time of counsel to argue for the brokers, unless there be any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.211" offset="2750660">Perhaps I should say further intrude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.896" offset="4557393">I think it is a very difficult fact question, and one of the reasons we think the CFTC exists is to resolve that very difficult fact question, where they have the advantage of the particular knowledge of what can and cannot be manipulative in commodities markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.174" offset="4622491">In 1936, Congress passed a comprehensive law to regulate a marketplace which has, had, and continues to have a major effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.748" offset="4672855">Its concern was protecting the nation's economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.700" offset="4684662">The language of the Commodity Exchange Act in 1936, when the operative sections at issue were passed, has not one word suggestive of an intent to create a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.525" offset="4735966">The legislative history likewise has not one word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.412" offset="4755506">Because of Congressional concern that federal pre-emption might occur with respect to individual conduct, it preserved under Section 4c the right to bring actions under state law in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.671" offset="4816528">In 1974, the Commodity Exchange Act was amended, but it was not re-enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.094" offset="4846203">None of the amendments created a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.646" offset="4860414">The legislative history of the 1974 amendments tells us nothing about any 1974 amendment which would create a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.752" offset="4900851">The twig on which the CFTC has asked this Court to hang its hat is a jurisdictional savings clause which, as the Touche case teaches us, cannot create a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.076" offset="4950171">The remaining legislative history, ambiguous at best, tells us nothing except that perhaps a limited knowledge of what courts had done between 1936 and 1974, but courts cannot create private rights of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.686" offset="5016626">At best, they can examine statutory language and legislative history and find that Congress implicitly created the right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.413" offset="5699467">In a limited and perishable commodity, potatoes manipulators named Simplot and Taggares oversold the entire crop threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.650" offset="5728411">They never intended to liquidate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.085" offset="5734157">Their contracts... to take delivery of their short sales, and as a result they artificially depressed the price, irrespective of the normal supply and demand factors, which are what the commodity futures markets have the right to expect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.162" offset="5790477">In short, they and their brokers fixed the market and ultimately destroyed it, in full view of the exchange, which knowingly permitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.916" offset="5817540">The plaintiffs are entitled to deal with a free and fair futures market pursuant to the Congressional purpose and in accordance with the legislative scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.671" offset="5848574">Instead, they were thrown into a fixed market manipulated by Simplot, Taggares, and others who are not before this Court in this process, and not subject at all to reparations, incidentally, and who have carefully and tactically absented themselves from this Court here, but their conduct is not absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.548" offset="5916074">No one challenges that the conduct violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.916" offset="5929553">No one challenges that the market was polluted in violation of the Congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.387" offset="5947421">Those facts delineating that conduct by those people are set forth in exhaustive detail by Judge Friendly below in the record, at Pages 95 through 105 of the Joint Appendix, and I will refrain from repeating any of them, but will rely on that exposition, and note that if Judge Friendly is reversed, those major manipulators will go scot free, leaving their victims behind them, and if the purpose of the Congress, the purpose that Congress expressed when it amended or re-enacted the statute will also be frustrated, and the legislative scheme will be robbed of one of its crucial pieces that make up its symmetry, which is the private right of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.776" offset="12172923">My point is, they applied a private remedy in 1974 the way the private remedies were applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.766" offset="12224855">They couldn't know in 1974 that there would be the 1979 triad, and that the Court would now be wrestling at the end of the 1981 term... 1980 term, pardon me, and the beginning of the 1981 term with the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.895" offset="12297371">Fortunately or unfortunately, this is the first commodity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.001" offset="12333837">This is a sui generis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.353" offset="12339271">This does not go to the... has no close analogue to the six or seven recent decisions since the 1979 triad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.741" offset="12380753">They have some analogue in that they are securities cases, although there was no... there was a blank slate on those and they were considering Acts in 1934 or 1940 that were well prior to the expansion era of undertaking the judicial implication which started, as I think Justice Rehnquist pointed out, in 1946 with the Cardon case, and reached full flower with Borak, but if you take Borak as the starting point, 1964, and go from Borak to Cort against Ash in 1975, those eleven years, you have those eleven years, and you have a situation like the commodity statute, where you have a 50-year history, and where you have an unbroken chain of decisions... whether they are right or wrong, Congress is aware of those decisions, and you have those two items when Congress sits down in those eleven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.347" offset="12615229">It is a sui generis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.863" offset="12621289">It is just, as I said, miles apart from the recent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.181" offset="12642605">This is the only chance that the Court has to apply its standards to this particular Act, naturally, because this is the only case, these two cases, but... these consolidated cases for which I am arguing here have broader questions than simply 4b.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.886" offset="12769351">They narrowed the standards, is what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.088" offset="12782203">Yes, if Congress sat down... not Cort v. Ash specifically, because after Cort v. Ash, Your Honor noted in Cannon in your dissent that there were, I think 20 was the number, circuit courts of appeals that had implied private rights of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.703" offset="12872691">It really wasn't until 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.719" offset="12880737">Certainly in 1975 after the Cort against Ash decision, some smart Congressional staffers could have perked up their ears and written a little better, but I think if I were standing here and talking about a 1976 statute, I would be trying to stretch it to 1979, is what I am saying, but I don't have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.671" offset="12976554">I got... I am in before Cort against Ash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.889" offset="12989406">In conclusion, I would just like to emphasize that the exchanges are here today really asking for a little bit of judicial exculpation... exculpation by way of judicial legislation from something that Congress wouldn't give them in 1974 when it switched its theory from self-regulation, from fox in the chicken coop self-regulation to compulsory regulation, and I think that based on all of the cases, based on the standards as they exist today, enunciated here, the Court has to conclude that Judge Friendly should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.473" offset="13203715">Justice Stevens, you asked about the Deaktor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.094" offset="13226180">I think it is important to this Court to understand first, as has been ably pointed out, this Court's decision had nothing to do with the private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.052" offset="13274037">That was the Seventh Circuit's decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerard K. Sandweg, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3302.263" offset="13346866">It did not order dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.529" offset="13351986">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.196" offset="13354598">But the use of Deaktor here is to illuminate what Congress knew when it enacted the 1974 Act, and our point is that the 1974 Act and Congress's knowledge of Deaktor in 1974 is not relevant to this Court's inquiry about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.427" offset="13431503">The question here is what the Congress did in 1936 when it enacted the operative language alleged to give rise to the right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.151" offset="13478419">When Deaktor was cited to the Court... to the Congress in 1974, it was not cited to Congress to show the existence of a private right of action, The purpose of it being cited was to show the application the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.410" offset="13539441">Thus, whatever the Seventh Circuit may have held, or whatever the implications of this Court's decision may have been, they do not give rise to Congressional knowledge in 1974 even if that knowledge were relevant, which we claim that is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.687" offset="13600567">Secondly, the question of reparations availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.739" offset="13616763">We believe Section 13a of the Act must be considered with care in analyzing whether or not reparations are available to persons in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.797" offset="13665037">My own client has had a reparations claim filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission which the commission has forwarded to us, which is the way the commission initiates the proceeding, having determined that the claim, so to speak, states a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.975" offset="13725746">That is by a non-customer, just as Mr. Toboroff's clients are non-customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.479" offset="13751764">The reparations availability as to Messrs Simplot and Taggares have to be read under 13a, which talks about anyone who commands, induces, et cetera, a violation of the Act is liable in an administrative proceeding as a principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.873" offset="13829295">We submit that reparations are an administrative proceeding under the Act quite clearly, and therefore a person in the character of Messrs. Simplot and Taggares, who were alleged to have violated the Act, would be liable on reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.366" offset="13883317">In addition, much has been made as if Mr. Simplot and Mr. Taggares had not been punished by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.287" offset="13911006">Quite the contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.306" offset="13919052">The exchange imposed massive penalties against them, in addition to CFTC imposed long-term suspensions from trading on these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.464" offset="13967744">Moreover, Mr. Toboroff continues under Judge Mansfield's decision to have available his antitrust claims against them, which remain pending in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.071" offset="14010167">Thus, they were severely penalized under a statute designed by Congress to accomplish exactly what it accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.093" offset="14046216">If there are no further questions, we thank the Court for its indulgence.</text>
