            <text syncTime="104.895" offset="549576">This constitutional right existed in its full sanctity in New York prior to 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.251" offset="583012">At that time Teleprompter and other cable television companies made a practice of seeking owner consent before installing cable television lines and the necessary accompanying equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.979" offset="653961">It was their practice, dictated by management, to solicit consent using a printed form which you'll find in the joint appendix at pages 32 to 33, which provided specifically for compensation at the rate of five percent of gross revenues derived from the building on which the installation was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.829" offset="745285">Effective as of January 1, 1973, Executive Law Section 828 was adopted and made effective in New York, prohibiting landlord interference with installations and prohibiting any payments to landlords from cable television companies or from tenants with respect to such installations, with the exception of purely discretionary compensation which could be made by the cable television commission with respect to installations servicing the tenants on the property on which the installation was made, and then only if application was made for it within a very short period after the installation had been made, some, I believe, 180 days if I remember correctly.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.602" offset="980387">According to the Court of Appeals, there may be no compensation for crossovers under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.537" offset="1012152">Mrs. Loretto then brought this action sounding in trespass, and the sole defense remaining after the elimination of a number of defenses by the Court of Appeals is Section 828, and we're presented therefore with the question of whether there are any extraordinary factors which take this case out of the usual rule that a landlord is entitled to exclusive possession, and particularly to exclusivity with respect to the installation of permanent installations on the property, particularly including television aerials and the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.345" offset="2007417">We have urged here the observance of a per se or absolute rule in an era when we recognize that balancing of constitutional rights is popular, on the theory that it is traditional in the area of physical occupation of property or seizure of title to observe a per se rule, although this Court has seldom had an opportunity in perhaps the last century or so to apply that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.985" offset="2165928">There are some exceptions which I'll mention in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.500" offset="2175959">Kaiser Aetna for one states that the right to exclude is universally held to be a fundamental element of the property right, which the government cannot take without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.120" offset="2230503">And even if the government physically invades only an easement in property, it must nonetheless pay just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.162" offset="2262686">In St. Louis versus Western Union, which is an 1893 case, this Court held that the installation of telegraph lines and poles in a municipality, no matter how de minimis that installation might be, constitutes a taking, and that the city's use of the top cross-arm of the pole constitutes a taking by the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.182" offset="2378774">There's similar dictum of this Court in United States versus Causby, 1948, and one might also look to the Delaware Railroad case, 1928, where the Court held that a municipality's direction to a railroad company to set aside a portion of the private street running through the railroad station property as a taxi stand constitutes a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.420" offset="2503639">In none of these, I submit, was there any balancing approach with respect to the determination of whether a property right had been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.585" offset="2564348">The balancing approach does come in in regulation cases, such as PruneYard versus Robins, where the Court, on the basis of the ruling made in California, recognized that the people who had come onto the property to distribute literature and solicit signatures were part of the general public who were invited onto the property, were properly there, and were present by virtue of a special invitation made by the owner to the general public to come onto the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.881" offset="2729546">And the question was, to what extent can the state regulate the activities of such people or the activities of the owner with respect to such people on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.813" offset="2785239">The regulation concept grew up entirely distinctly from the old-fashioned physical occupation or seizure of title concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.543" offset="6836204">That, Mr. Chief Justice, is a question of New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.196" offset="6866820">On it I would rely on the opinion filed in this case by the Attorney General of New York, in which he says that if a tenant wants telephone service that he can apply to the Public Service Commission of New York, which would direct the telephone company to condemn an easement to provide the television service to that building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.921" offset="6969638">I think that as I understand the law of New York, the landlord could not prevent the installation of telephone service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.714" offset="7000880">But under the statutory law of New York, which goes back 90 years, that right to enter the premises would be obtained by condemning an easement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.886" offset="7929585">This is property which, when Mrs. Loretto owns it alone and keeps it vacant, is undoubtedly hers, and Section 828 has no application to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.068" offset="7978278">But when she chooses to devote the property to rental purposes, that connotes a divided ownership of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.567" offset="9856273">I think that there is a distinction between what I call trunk lines and feeder lines, and there are old cases of this Court, 100 years ago, involving telephone... telegraph companies putting their lines down city streets and down railroad rights of way, and it was held that they had to pay for that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.119" offset="9950522">And I would suspect that if New York passed a statute saying that any cable television company is entitled to put its trunk lines on private property without paying, that that would not be held to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.049" offset="10026173">I think it is different with respect to feeder lines, and that perhaps is an appropriate place for me to come to the crossover problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.761" offset="10089076">There are two kinds of crossovers, as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.602" offset="10112377">The New York Court of Appeals said there were three, but I think that two of those present the same legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.537" offset="10144142">One is what I call the short crossover, and that is that when the cable comes in on the roof to this building, having come from the adjacent building on this side and serving a tenant in this building, then the cable continues, and the record shows in this case four to six feet, in order to bring service to the next building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.322" offset="10255319">And we suggest, first, that that's de minimis; and second, that there is a clear quid pro quo in it, because this building's tenants get the service because there's a crossover from the next building, and to say that in order to do that you have to provide the same kind of a lead to the adjoining building on the other side doesn't seem very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.777" offset="10381125">But in any event, we would contend that that is not a taking requiring a payment under the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states by the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.740" offset="10452909">Now, the other one is what I call the pure crossover, and that is the situation where there is no tenant in this building who has cable television, but the cable television company wants to bring the cable from the building on the right across this building in order to get to the building on the left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.041" offset="10558131">And I would say that even that, even as applied to that, the statute is valid, just as the New York statute now provides that a person who builds a new apartment house must provide it with water and sewer service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.158" offset="10638588">There are no tenants in the building when he is building it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.942" offset="12297781">Well, in addition to fire escapes and sprinklers... in addition to sprinklers, there are fire escapes and smoke detectors, and those have a safety element in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.875" offset="12341458">But let me point out several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.483" offset="12351907">The Causby case has been referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.608" offset="12360475">We usually think of that as the case which said that when there are low-flying planes that means that is a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.934" offset="12385762">But the Causby case is the case which, by way of dictum, but it certainly is one of the most powerful dictums that was ever uttered by this Court, said that the statutes of Congress which provide that the upper air space is a public highway and can be used freely without compensation, thereby changing the clear common law, which said from the surface of the earth to the highest heavens, the Court in the Causby case said that property can be taken without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.217" offset="12518882">Now, similarly in Block and Hirsch, which is the early rent control case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.464" offset="12547825">The statute in that case provides the tenant can continue to occupy the property after the end of the lease if he continues to pay the same rent, and that is surely a permanent occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.113" offset="12610415">And one that rather appeals to me is mailboxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.690" offset="12632776">We have cited Section 57 of the New York Multiple Dwelling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.311" offset="12663287">Mr. Gruen in his brief says, well, there isn't any requirement that there be mailboxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.027" offset="12694111">What the situation is is that the Post Office Department, through regulations... and this is... this is 155.6, says that:</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.454" offset="12787838">"Delivery of mail shall be contingent upon the installation and maintenance of mail receptacles approved by the Postal Service. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.279" offset="12835068">Which would mean that if you don't have the receptacles you don't get mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.291" offset="12859205">But New York has provided by Section 57 that you must provide for receptacles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.399" offset="12883551">And let's continue with the Post Office regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.882" offset="12901523">There is a regulation on apartment house mail receptacles called Publication 17, and it provides on page 12 that mailboxes must be 6 inches by 5 inches by 15 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.108" offset="12978428">Now, if you multiply that out, it's 450 cubic inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.559" offset="12996191">And if you take a half-inch cable which is on the roof, it takes 194 feet of half-inch cable to occupy 450 cubic inches.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.975" offset="13221889">Well, the time might come when that would seem to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.833" offset="13237353">As of now it seems rather far-fetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.973" offset="13245922">But in New York City I suggest that cable television has become as near a necessity as a telephone and electric service, as to which there really isn't any question because they are always provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.794" offset="13313213">And what New York was trying to do through this statute was to facilitate the development of cable service as a means of improving communication and education in the city of New York or the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.053" offset="13382176">And I would suggest that that is within the generally accepted powers of state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.644" offset="13420524">Now, I would like to refer to Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.314" offset="13427211">It's easy to say, well, Penn Central is just regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.453" offset="13447796">It's not... it doesn't have anything to do with occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.171" offset="13458663">But the fact was that all that space up there, which was reachable by the Penn Central people by building up it, was taken away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.604" offset="13496384">It isn't that it is occupied by someone else; it's not occupied by them, which is a complete interference with their rights of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.257" offset="13539016">It is true that they received a sort of compensation in the form of transferable development rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.783" offset="13577154">But it is also clear that the Court did not have any conception... or didn't decide that that constituted full value or payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.077" offset="13614353">I would suggest that that is a case of permanent occupancy of the Penn Central space without the payment of just compensation, because the Court concluded on the balance of all the factors involved this was the kind of regulation which did not constitute a taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.283" offset="13735143">Indeed, this all goes back to Mundt against Illinois, which in 1877 decided that the taking provision of the Fifth Amendment does not prevent... or of the Fourteenth Amendment... does not prevent a state from regulating substantially to the extent of taking away a large share of the profits of a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.989" offset="13853948">Now, we have a number of other instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.080" offset="13886340">The Section 50(c) of the New York Multiple Dwelling Law provides that the landlord must allow the tenants to organize and provide a doorman in the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.086" offset="13978291">The doorman occupies some of the landlord's space, for which he receives no compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.528" offset="14404087">First let me take up a couple of areas where Mr. Griswold and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.792" offset="14429164">One is that I also would like to argue the telephone case, but on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.585" offset="14448286">The second is more germane to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.443" offset="14471796">Mr. Griswold has proposed that if trunk lines were installed under the auspices of Section 828 that would probably be unconstitutional, but that he distinguishes between trunk lines and feeder lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.202" offset="14538774">We of course agree that such installation of trunk lines would be unconstitutional, but I think we differ on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.464" offset="14583809">Let me demonstrate to you, if you will take a look at joint appendix page 166, just what a crossover is, what a block circuit installation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.816" offset="14633233">This diagram on page 166 illustrates a typical New York City block and a typical installation by Teleprompter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.079" offset="14674297">In the upper left-hand corner of the diagram, the cable enters at number 118 Riverside Drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.872" offset="14705435">It then continues about halfway around the block on West 84th Street and it goes down along Riverside Drive from 118 to 110 Riverside Drive, and then along the lower rung of buildings on West 83rd Street, occasionally crossing back to the buildings on 84th Street to provide service there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.159" offset="14802611">What this diagram shows is a trunk line, in my opinion, what I would call a trunk line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.265" offset="14843048">This diagram shows that the typical installation is the use of rooftops of buildings in New York as if they were a public highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.636" offset="14888501">There is an easement there, by all traditional definitions of what an easement is, to provide service to buildings by dropping feeder lines from that trunks line along the roof to individual apartments and buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.737" offset="14952971">There has been discussion about the Attorney General providing in New York that a tenant is entitled to receive telephone service if he wants, the telephone company may be required to condemn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.116" offset="15078464">We of course don't deny for a minute that the legislature in New York may require the provision of cable television service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.816" offset="15113259">What we say is that, just like in the case of telephone service, it requires condemnation or compensation in the form of rental payments for the use of our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.514" offset="15160070">Mr. Griswold suggested that the labor cases, such as Babcock &amp; Wilcox, allow absolutely free entry by organizers onto private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.661" offset="15244602">I would suggest that this is slightly inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.942" offset="15257768">What these cases provide... particularly I refer you to Central Hardware and Babcock &amp; Wilcox... is that where the owner of the property has situated it in such a way that it's inaccessible... his employees are inaccessible by any means other than a temporary entry by union organizers for the limited duration of an organizational campaign, then he has taken steps which modify his property right to the extent that he is in effect creating a nuisance his injuring outsiders by not permitting their entry for very limited purposes onto his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.049" offset="15414189">I would submit that this is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.658" offset="15424638">There is no necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.939" offset="15429758">Communications can proceed quite freely to tenants absent cable television, by mail, telephone, any other method.</text>
