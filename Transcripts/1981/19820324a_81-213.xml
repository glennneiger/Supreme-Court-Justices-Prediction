            <text syncTime="67.442" offset="409224">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="95.676" offset="522178">The issue in this case is whether differences in the financial eligibility requirements prescribed in Section 1903(f) of the Social Security Act for the two major groups of potential Medicaid beneficiaries violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.256" offset="600545">The first group is the categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.708" offset="618308">Aged, blind and disabled individuals whose income is less than the income limits established in the cash assistance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.599" offset="657910">The second group is referred to as the medically needy, and includes aged, blind and disabled individuals whose income is greater than the cash assistance limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.324" offset="708796">All of the appellees are in the second group.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.625" offset="725933">The decision in this case, however, will not only determine the constitutional validity of the differences in the income requirements, but also, the validity of Congress's decision to require participating states to provide Medicaid coverage to the categorically needy but not to the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.022" offset="799598">The Medicaid program was established in Title 19 of the Social Security Act and provides federal financial assistance to states that choose to pay for medical treatment for certain groups of poor people.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.264" offset="852574">States that choose to participate in the program must provide Medicaid coverage to all individuals who are receiving benefits under one of two cash assistance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.071" offset="899804">Either the federally-financed supplement security income for the aged, blind and disabled program, or the jointly-financed program for providing aid to families with dependent children, the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.729" offset="958423">Participating states are not required as a general matter to provide Medicaid benefits to any other group of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.687" offset="994263">Therefore, a person who is not eligible for benefits under one of the cash assistance programs is also ineligible for benefits under the Medicaid program unless his state chooses to provide benefits to one of the optional categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.530" offset="1061554">The major optional coverage group is the medically needy; people who are ineligible for cash assistance only because of the amount of their income.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.122" offset="1115993">Section 1903, however, provides that states are only entitled to federal financial assistance for providing Medicaid benefits to a medically needy individual if he incurs medical expenses in excess of the difference between his income and the state's spend down level.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.184" offset="1188196">The spend down level for a person with a family of a given size must not exceed 133 1/3 percent of the state AFDC payment amount for a family of the same size.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.976" offset="1235425">The SSI program guarantees a federal minimum benefit, but the states may supplement that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.764" offset="1274504">If the state chooses to make supplemental payments to individuals who are receiving SSI benefits or who would be eligible for SSI benefits except for the amount of their income, the state may also provide Medicaid benefits to those individuals without regard to the 133 1/2 percent limitation prescribed in Section 1903.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.197" offset="1364261">Massachusetts participates in the Medicaid program, provides Medicaid benefits to the medically needy, makes supplemental benefits to SSI benefit recipients or people who would be eligible for SSI except for the amount of their income, and provides Medicaid benefits to people who are eligible for supplemental payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.895" offset="1459033">All of those choices are voluntary choices on the part of the state of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.966" offset="1479304">Appellees filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts challenging the maximum medically needy spend down level prescribed in Section 1903(f) as inconsistent with the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.694" offset="1554223">Appellees also challenge the corresponding provisions of the Massachusetts Medicaid plan as inconsistent with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.070" offset="1615768">Appellees represent a class of all present and future Social Security benefit recipients who live in Massachusetts, are disabled or older than 65 years old, are ineligible for cash assistance because of the amount of their income, and have medical expenses not subject to payment by third parties that are greater than the difference between their countable income and the cash assistance income limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.206" offset="1736349">The district court in this case held that to the extent that Section 1903(f) requires the state of Massachusetts to establish a spend down level that is less than the state supplemental payment income limits, the statute discriminated against appellees, in violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.322" offset="1828823">The district court concluded that the time for comparing the circumstances of the medically needy including the appellees, the group to whom Section 1903(f) applies, and the circumstances of the categorically needy, to whom Section 1903(f) is not applicable, was after the medically needy had incurred medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.905" offset="1939059">According to the district court, at that point there is no difference between the medically needy and the categorically needy, and consequently, no basis for distinguishing between the two groups, as Section 1903(f) does.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.030" offset="3063578">Well, last year, Representative Frank of Massachusetts... and according to appellees, in response to this litigation... introduced a bill that would adopt exactly the statutory argument that appellees press on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.290" offset="3124600">Congress did not act on it last term and I am not even sure that it has been referred to a committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.576" offset="3157828">Contrary to appellees' submission and contrary to the premise of the submission of amicus Massachusetts Association of Older Americans, this case does not involve any post hoc rationalization of Congress's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.505" offset="3225538">When Congress enacted Section 1903(f) in 1967, its stated purpose was to reduce federal expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.896" offset="3275066">In its view, in Congress's view, the states had been much too generous in defining who constitute the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.770" offset="3322609">As the House committee clearly indicated its concern that some of the plans operated to greatly reduce the incentives for participating in the optional Medicare program, and the committee further emphasized its view that Medicaid was never intended to supplant private health insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.350" offset="3396901">As the Senate committee observed, a tendency of some states to identify as eligibles for medical assistance under Title 19 large numbers of persons who could reasonably be expected to pay some or all of their own medical expenses, has not only significantly increased the amount of federal funds flowing into this program, but has developed future cost projections at a level totally inconsistent with the expectations of Congress when it enacted this program in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.953" offset="3519258">Congress's explicit purpose was to limit federal expenditures, and to do so by limiting the state's coverage of the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.825" offset="3558756">By definition, the medically needy have more income than the categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.331" offset="3584774">As a matter of fact, that is the only difference between the two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.533" offset="3605567">Furthermore, since the medically needy group includes anyone who would be eligible for SSI except for the amount of his income, an individual can qualify for Medicaid benefits as medically needy, no matter how much greater than the cash assistance limits his income might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.332" offset="3692816">As a class, therefore, the medically needy are plainly better able than the categorically needy to pay their own medical expenses or to take steps to assure that future medical expenses can be paid by, for example, purchasing private insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.992" offset="3759480">With few exceptions, it was plain to the members of the 90th Congress that the medically needy were less needy that the categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.799" offset="3798664">All the proposals introduced in 1967 to limit federal expenditures were directed at limiting expenditures on behalf of the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.655" offset="3838057">As Senator Long put it, we are talking here about, the people who are not on the cash public assistance rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.059" offset="3863761">That is the area in which we think savings should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.046" offset="3887689">On this point, Senator Long spoke for an overwhelming majority of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.450" offset="3913289">Section 1903(f) distinguishes between the medically needy and the categorically need because the medically needy are financially better able to provide for their own medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.258" offset="3960519">Precisely the same reasoning underlies Congress's decision to require the states or participating states to cover the categorically needy but not the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.148" offset="4008062">Therefore, the reason for the distinction in Section 1903(f) between the categorically needy and the medically needy is implicit in the structure of the Medicaid program itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.623" offset="4058008">Now, to the extent that... to the extent relevant in this case, section 1903(f) distinguishes between two groups: aged, blind and disabled individuals whose income is less than the cash assistance levels, and aged, blind and disabled individuals whose income is greater than the cash assistance levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.552" offset="4149645">Accordingly, the appropriate groups, or the appropriate classifications for equal protection analysis are those two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.760" offset="4190501">Appellees' status as social security benefit recipients is completely immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.414" offset="4213175">There are social security benefit recipients on both sides and appellees don't even suggest that there are any disproportionate number of social security benefit recipients in the medically needy category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.604" offset="4257897">In addition, it is inappropriate for equal protection analysis to compare aged, blind and disabled individuals whose income is greater than the cash assistance levels, but whose income net of medical expenses is less than the cash assistance levels, with the group of aged, blind and disabled individuals whose gross income is less than the cash assistance levels because Congress simply did not create that classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.575" offset="4385792">The consequences of adopting the district court's analysis and appellees' contentions in this case are quite far reaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.347" offset="4420901">If, as the district court held, for purposes of equal protection analysis the income of the medically need net of medical expenses must be compared with the gross income of the categorically needy, there is no constitutional distinction between the two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.414" offset="4521107">In fact, there is no difference at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.420" offset="4677214">And if that is true, Fullington v. Shea was wrongly decided and must be overruled; two, Section 1902(a)(10) of the Act, which distinguishes between the categorically needy and the medically needy by requiring the states to cover one but not the other... or, requiring the states to cover the categorically needy but not the medically needy, is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.535" offset="4769583">And finally and perhaps most importantly, the 20 jurisdictions that now provide Medicaid benefits for the categorically needy but do not provide any benefits at all for the medically needy must either extend coverage to the medically needy or simply drop out of the program altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.045" offset="4839696">The district court seemed to be completely oblivious to those consequences, and we think they are... they simply underscore the error in his decision and the error in his analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.721" offset="4890374">Contrary to the premise of the district court's opinion also, there is no basis at all in the legislative history of this provision for concluding that the difference in treatment of the categorically needy and the medically needy was the result of some sort of legislative accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.753" offset="4986504">On its face, the statute distinguishes between those people who are eligible for cash assistance and those people who are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.526" offset="5017538">The statute only applies to the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.228" offset="5036346">The distinction drawn between the medically needy and the categorically needy was described on the floor of the Senate and described in the conference report, it is the 67 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.969" offset="5083366">The information before Congress plainly indicated that in many states, the 133 1/3 percent of the AFDC amount was going to be less than the old age assistance income limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.443" offset="5133208">Indeed, the Under Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, now Health and Human Services, specifically pointed out that 133 1/3 percent of the AFDC payment amount, in some states, was even lower than the AFDC standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.571" offset="5197783">Although no one disputed the goal of saving money, the provision that was ultimately adopted as Section 1903(f) of the Act was repeatedly criticized on the basis that it was too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.247" offset="5260476">Congressmen claimed that the provision would destroy the concept of medical indigence in the Medicaid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.503" offset="5289525">It is unlikely in these circumstances that the congressmen... that the entire Congress, as appellees contend, ignored or overlooked the significance of the data indicating the effect of adopting this 133 1/3 percent limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.696" offset="5358279">In our view, it is far more likely that the few people in Congress regarded the difference in treatment as... difference in treatment of the medically needy and the categorically needy... to be as offensive as appellees seem to think they should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.224" offset="5420346">Indeed, Senator Javits expressly argued or made several policy arguments against discriminating against the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.949" offset="5467262">The Senate... Senator Javits's arguments were made in support of the Kuchel Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.203" offset="5496310">The Senate, by a vote of more than... by a margin of more than two to one, rejected those policy arguments and enacted the Senate Bill as the committee had proposed, with the expression provision that discriminated against the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.113" offset="5559944">That is a different provision than the one that is at issue here, but it was replaced by the provision here, and it seems to us that the vote in the Senate on the Kuchel Amendment plainly indicates that at least those members of the Senate who voted on that bill did not regard discrimination against the medically needy, or a difference in treatment of the medically needy and the categorically needy as something so offensive that it could never be tolerated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.510" offset="5741547">The issue before the Court is whether Congress has required a state Medicaid program to apply a lower subsistence standard to a group of indigent, aged and disabled people who do not depend on public assistance, lower than it applies to public assistance recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.602" offset="5805913">And if so, whether it is constitutional for Congress to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.721" offset="5818347">Now let me begin by responding to the question which Justice Rehnquist raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.375" offset="5836947">We do not challenge the ability of a state to determine eligibility on the basis of gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.946" offset="5859307">We do not challenge the ability of Congress or a state to draw eligibility conditions on the basis of broad, general characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.450" offset="5893267">But that is not the way this program worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.468" offset="5901312">The classification involved in this program is not a broad, general, overbroad characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.889" offset="5927017">Massachusetts makes a precise determination of the impact of medical expenses on financial need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.126" offset="5951990">It does identify those members of the appellee class who are identically situation to SSI recipients by considering the additional factor of medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.583" offset="5989815">This case is thus radically unlike the cases such as Fullington, for instance, or Weinberger vs. Salfi where the cases upheld over-broad classifications on the grounds of administrative convenience of administrative simplicity on the theory that a state need not consider every factor bearing on need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.145" offset="6068078">A program has no obligation to identify all the people who are identically situated in terms of the program's purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.911" offset="6691151">That is, the way it works is this: to the extent that the individual has income in excess of the eligibility standards, the state then considers the individual's medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.286" offset="6736604">To the extent that the individual's medical expenses reduce his income below the public assistance standard or the medically needy standard, the individual is then entitled to Medicaid for medical expenses, for which any remaining excess income is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.878" offset="6798984">The individual spends the excess income for his or her own medical expenses, receives Medicaid for only those remaining expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.734" offset="6830436">Now, the effect of that, if the medically needy standards were set at the same level as the SSI standard, would be to precisely equalize the treatment of these two groups of aged and disabled people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.491" offset="7201479">It is always the case that welfare benefits are optional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.545" offset="7217675">On the other hand, all of this Court's cases stand for the proposition that once a court undertakes to provide benefits, it assumes minimal obligations of rationality in distributing them.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="1798.129" offset="7331987">No, but it is important to focus on why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.898" offset="7339092">The reason why is that Congress and the states have a right to determine eligibility on the basis of general criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.337" offset="7368872">They do not have to consider every factor bearing on need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.139" offset="7384023">When the state chooses to determine eligibility on the basis of gross income alone, there is a state interest in simplicity and convenience; there is also at least a formal equality in the way people are measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.478" offset="7425400">In this instance, however, Congress has given Massachusetts its option and Massachusetts has accepted it, to consider an additional factor to make it a more precise determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.583" offset="7461867">And when Massachusetts does that, we submit, it cannot apply a different standard of non-medical need to an identically-situated group of aged and disabled people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.641" offset="7502096">Now, the relevance of the legislative history to both the statutory and the equal protection arguments is that the entire purpose of Congress in creating the medically needy option was precisely to enable the states to avoid the unfairness which results when aged and disabled people who cannot receive welfare are left with less income for their non-medical needs than they would receive if they could qualify for welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.674" offset="7602197">Virtually identical language in both the House and the Senate reports on the original 1965 legislation indicates that Congress' entire purpose in doing this was precisely to avoid the unfairness that is involved in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.885" offset="7671056">Congress proposed to do this through the two distinctive features of medically needy coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.039" offset="7687670">The first is the net income principle; the second is the comparability principle, which now appears in the statute in Section 1902(a)(17), and which was enacted in 1965 for the precise purpose of prohibiting a state from setting its medically needy standards below its categorically needy standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.055" offset="7895709">They are quoted on page 13 of our brief, the last two sentence are:</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.024" offset="7911592">"In no event, however, may a state require the use of income or resources which would bring the individual's income below the test of eligibility under the state plan. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.747" offset="8458491">Congress did intend to lower the medically needy standards; it did not contemplate that they would be lowered below the categorically needy standards, and thus abrogate the specific commitment to equity between public assistance recipients and the retired working corps which Congress made in the comparability provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.673" offset="8522125">The legislative history of the 4/3 rule in 1967 shows that Congress was reacting to the New York program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.161" offset="8548143">That program had set its medically standard so high that nearly 40 to 45 percent of the entire state had been made eligible, even before consideration of medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.885" offset="8590984">Congress thought that New York had abused the program to make its benefits available to people whom Congress had never thought would benefit from the program, and imposed the 4/3 rule as a cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.007" offset="8631526">The sponsors of the 4/3 rule repeatedly characterized its purpose as simply to bring the New York program into line with Congress' original expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.548" offset="8669665">As one of the sponsors put it, none of the basic purposes of Title 19 have been harmed or injured in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.786" offset="8698609">The 1967 legislation made no amendment to the comparability requirement which was specifically enacted to prevent medically needy income standards from being set below the corresponding categorical standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.694" offset="8750227">And the legislation shows that if Congress had intended to alter that comparability standard, it would have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.581" offset="8773841">In fact, in 1967, Congress did enact a provision which was intended to make a minor codification in the related comparability provision, also known as a comparability provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.888" offset="8815010">And in that instance, Congress made a separate and specific amendment to that comparability provision which appeared in the 1967 legislation under the heading "Modification of Comparability Provisions".</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.113" offset="8859941">Not a word was said under that heading about any modification intended in the comparability provision requiring medically needy standards at least as high as categorically needy standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.421" offset="8905185">Nor was anything said in the debates or hearings that suggested any understanding that this result would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.158" offset="8932143">And again, had there been any such understanding, the record indicates that there would have been such discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.025" offset="8951578">The one statutory amendment Congress did consider in 1967 which was identified as discriminating against the medically needy was severely criticized for doing so and was eliminated from the legislation as enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.869" offset="9002987">The statement from Senator Long, which Mr. Jones quoted does not refer at all to the 4/3 rule, but refers to a separate provision that was considered in the Senate that had nothing to do with income eligibility limitations and did discriminate against the medically needy and was eliminated from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.914" offset="9079160">Now, Mr. Jones emphasizes there were states in 1967 in which the 4/3 maximum was below the old age standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.686" offset="9110194">To be specific, there were six states with medically needy programs, six out of 22, although in only three of them was the difference at all substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.625" offset="9146034">The important fact is that this conclusion is derived from a very elaborate and, we concede, ingenious analysis Mr. Jones has performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.862" offset="9174978">It was not an analysis that was performed by an legislator in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.183" offset="9192218">The only medically needy program Congress discussed in anymore than a passing fashion in 1967 was the New York program, and in New York, the 4/3 maximum was well above the old age assistance levels, there was no danger that the result in this case would occur in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.593" offset="9365880">It is worth recalling that the 4/3 rule was part of an omnibus Social Security Act with massive changes in all the social security programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2815.081" offset="11399774">On the other hand, the legislative history does have bearing under the analysis in, for instance, Schweiker versus Wilson, because the first place one looks when one cannot infer a rational basis from the language of the statute, is to the legislative history to see if Congress, in fact, made an explicit judgment that some purpose would be rationally served by the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.542" offset="11469678">We submit in this case that Congress made no such judgment in this judgment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.577" offset="11489740">The next question, of course, is whether the government can hypothesize a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.945" offset="11511265">We would submit that a hypothetical rational basis of the sort that the government hypothesized would have to meet at least two conditions to be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.551" offset="11541672">First, it would have to have some consistency with the statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.937" offset="11559226">So much is implied in the requirement of rationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.039" offset="11571660">Second, it would have to be supported either by some judicially-noticeable data, or at least by some a priori common sense plausibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.560" offset="11605724">We submit that on reflection, the private insurance argument satisfies neither of these criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.981" offset="11627458">First, with respect to statutory framework, the private insurance argument is not only unsupported by any actual legislative judgment that the appellees have better access to insurance, or that encouraging to purchase insurance would reduce Medicaid costs; it is, in fact, contrary to the premises which Congress acted on when it created the medically needy program, which are precisely that people who have less income after medical expenses than welfare recipients are identically situated to welfare recipients and should be treated as identically situated to welfare recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.733" offset="11746367">Now, with respect to judicially noticeable data, the only such data about private insurance that has been cited to the Court is the data we cite on pages 44 through 46 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.755" offset="11786491">that data consists of the data which Congress considered in 1965 with respect to the availability of private insurance to the aged when it enacted the Medicare program, and some more recent data, published data, which is entirely consistent with that data which we have cited to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.634" offset="11858067">That data indicates two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.134" offset="11864023">First, it indicates that there is no private insurance available to the aged which covers the majority of services for which Medicaid expenditure are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.007" offset="11899549">70 % of Medicaid expenditures are made for private insurance... excuse me, are made for nursing home care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.762" offset="11926507">Virtually no private insurance covers the type of nursing home care for which Medicaid expenditures on behalf of the aged are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.932" offset="11955242">Second, the data indicates that where private insurance does cover expenses that Medicaid does cover, it does so at greater cost than Medicaid does because of the expenses of sales effort, advertising and profit which often exceed 80 % of the total cost of the insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.246" offset="12032460">Now, I would submit that there are two rational conclusions that one can draw from this data, and that there are no rational conclusions that one can draw from it which sustain the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.553" offset="12077704">First, the first conclusion that the data suggests is that the principal incentive effect of the discrimination in this case on people who fear ending up in the situation of the appellees, is not to encourage the purchase of private insurance but to encourage them to make efforts to reduce post-retirement income so that they can qualify for SSI, by working less, saving less or by investing their income in exempt assets such as their home or burial plots, which are exempt under Medicaid and SSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.538" offset="12185642">Secondly, I would submit that the most plausible conclusion from this data is that even if the discrimination does encourage people who fear ending up in the situation of Mr. Hunter and Mr. Hogan to purchase private insurance, that their purchase of private insurance would increase, rather than reduce, the cost of the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.868" offset="12274981">That is true for this reason: explicitly under the statute under Section 1902(a)(17), and under all the regulations, the Medicaid program must credit the cost of the premiums against surplus income in determining eligibility of the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.996" offset="12343422">The effect of that is that the Medicaid program, in effect, pays for the insurance because by crediting the premiums, it in effect reduces the amount of expenses which the applicant would otherwise have to make for his own medical expenses and increases the amount that the state must pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.439" offset="12405280">If the insurance is a bad buy for the applicant, it is a bad buy for the Medicaid program and it will increase Medicaid costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.628" offset="12437985">Now, of course, if Congress had made a contrary determination, we would expect this Court to defer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.349" offset="12460868">But Congress has not considered the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.384" offset="12469018">We submit that the only rational course when all of the data before the court completely contradicts the hypothetical premise of the government, is that this is not a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.525" offset="12517606">Now, if I may I would like to just briefly return to the issue that I think Justice Stevens originally raised, which is the question of is there a difference in the extent to which the income of the two classes fluctuates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.284" offset="12576643">When I answered that question I should have pointed out that the accounting period for Medicaid eligibility is six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.919" offset="12599108">That is, in order to qualify for medically needy coverage, an applicant must demonstrate that his or her medical expenses will exceed the amount of his or her surplus income for at least six successive months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.210" offset="12644352">Now, both of the named appellees have, in fact, permanent conditions and indeed, it is probable that the vast majority of the class have conditions that go on for much longer than six months, and of course, they must re-establish eligibility every six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.268" offset="12692522">By contrast, the accounting period for SSI is from one to three months, so that one can establish eligibility for SSI if one has income, under those standards, for a single month; at most three months, depending on when in the quarter one applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.461" offset="12749365">So that insofar as one can determine from the statute, the income of SSI recipients is more likely to fluctuate than the income of the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.983" offset="12787399">Now I must say something to respond to an argument which Mr. Jones makes in the reply brief which he has not yet made here today, but since he may yet make it, I want to anticipate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.391" offset="12837032">If I understand Mr. Jones' reply brief correctly, he denies that there is any such thing as an income comparability requirement in the statute which requires comparability between medically needy and categorically needy classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.016" offset="12887500">If that is his position... and I may misunderstand him... it is an astonishing position, and it is contrary to Congress' clear understanding and the clear understanding of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.954" offset="12927311">I just wanted to draw the Court's attention to a sentence from the conferees' report on the 1981 Medicaid amendments which appears at three places in the Congressional Record and cited on page 14 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.845" offset="12974854">"Moreover, it is not the intent of the Conferees to alter the requirements under Section 1902(a)(17) of the Social Security Act relating to comparable treatment of income and resources between categorically needy and medically needy programs.

            <text syncTime="3632.178" offset="14668215">Furthermore, Mr. Justice Stevens, contrary to Professor Simon's answer to your question, if the time for comparing the medically needy and the categorically needy is after the medically needy have incurred medical expenses, and what you compare is the income net of medical expenses to the gross income of the categorically needy, there is no difference between the two groups, and all states would be required to adopt medically needy programs if they participate in the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.185" offset="14812202">I mean, there is simply no difference between the two groups other than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.053" offset="14823696">Moreover, in response to another of your questions, Professor Simon indicated that somehow the individuals in this class do not include people with average income, but it clearly does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.801" offset="14902690">The medically needy group includes anybody whose income... or any aged, blind or disabled individual whose income is greater than the gross... the cash assistance income limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3723.271" offset="15032571">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.038" offset="15035601">And that is exactly the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.957" offset="15047304">If a state adopts a Medicaid program for the categorically needy, there is no basis for saying that there is any legitimate reason for them not to cover people whose income, net of medical expenses, is less than the income of the categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.633" offset="15106027">The appellees make an argument about private insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.226" offset="15156392">They say that Congress could not have intended this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.209" offset="15164333">Congress clearly said the reason it was distinguishing between the categorically needy and the medically needy is because the operation of some state plans operated to discourage both the participation in the optional Medicare program, as well as to supplant private insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.421" offset="15245208">The House committee indicated that it clearly did not intend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.956" offset="15255343">And the Senate committee agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.325" offset="15264747">Now, appellees argue that the benefits provided by private insurance just would not be sufficient, or would be worth less than the premiums that the medically needy would have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.084" offset="15323784">That, it seems to me, is something that should be submitted to Congress, but Congress clearly believed that people with gross income in excess of the cash assistance level were better able than the categorically needy to take care of their own medical expenses, either by buying private insurance or some other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.450" offset="15413332">Throughout this case it has been assumed that the spend down level somehow indicates the amount of income that will, in fact, be left for non-medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.721" offset="15458367">As we tried to point out in our reply brief, the statute simply requires that an individual incur medical expenses of a particular amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.029" offset="15507582">It does not require that he pay medical expenses in the particular period that the state uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.147" offset="15528062">Massachusetts uses a six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.516" offset="15537570">But if the individual pays the expenses over a ten-month period, for example, he may never end up with less money for non-medical expenses than any categorically needy person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.692" offset="15598279">Appellees' entire argument depends on the proposition that incurring medical expenses somehow makes them the same as the categorically needy whose gross income is less than the cash assistance income limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.951" offset="15659301">Our submission, however, is that gross income is a perfectly reasonable basis for distinguishing between groups of individuals in a program intended to provide medical assistance for the poor.</text>
