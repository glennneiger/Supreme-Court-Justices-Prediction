            <text syncTime="73.679" offset="428371">Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court please, the question involved in this case is whether and in what circumstances an employer may withdraw from multi-employer collective bargaining after negotiations have commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.461" offset="523457">The Petitioner in this case contends that the occurrence of an impasse during such bargaining, in this case one which had existed for more than six months at the time of the withdrawal, and which had been followed by a selective strike against Petitioner alone, not all the members of the group, justifies its withdrawal from the multi-employer group.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.934" offset="673400">Well, the Labor Board has never made an exact definition of an impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.240" offset="702657">They have found in many cases that an impasse has existed, and many cases have turned on the question as to whether there is an impasse, but neither the Board nor the courts have ever precisely defined an impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.766" offset="768694">My definition of an impasse is a situation where the parties have reached the point where there is no longer any progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.855" offset="805057">They have reached a deadlock or a stalemate, and neither party has indicated any possibility of any movement whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.102" offset="882066">That's correct, Your Honor, in my... in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.554" offset="895859">The courts... neither the Board nor the courts have ever said precisely that, but that would be the way I would define an impasse.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="203.628" offset="948208">Negotiations did resume, and eventually there was an agreement, but of course we can't tell at this point, looking at it from hindsight, whether such... whether the impasse would ever have been broken if the Petitioner had not... had not withdrawn from the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.875" offset="1033158">If the parties had remained locked in that ice jam, possibly this might have gone on for years and years.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.563" offset="1067953">It might have gone on forever without any movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.697" offset="1076417">It was only when the Petitioner did withdraw that we had what might be called the first beginning of a thaw in the ice jam, and there were certain actions triggered which I will refer to later, which in our opinion, at least, did provide the circumstances under which the impasse or the log jam or the ice jam was finally broken.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.330" offset="1274948">He hired replacements, and he continued to operate under the... under the handicaps of a strike, and I might add that there were certain factors in the strike which were the subject of litigation in another matter, but are not before the Court here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.090" offset="1333984">May I make it clear at this point that the employer, in withdrawing from the multi-employer group, had no intent to extinguish its bargaining obligation to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.402" offset="1411307">It offered to continue bargaining with the union on a single employer basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.427" offset="1671382">The record doesn't show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.677" offset="1676397">The Labor Board in this case, contrary to the petition then held by five Circuit Courts of Appeals, held that the withdrawal constituted an unfair labor practice, and the Circuit Court for the First Circuit has affirmed this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.327" offset="1779006">I make note, Your Honors, that since the Court of Appeals decision in this case, two of the five Circuit Courts which had formerly refused to follow the Board position, have adopted the Board's position, and would go along with the Board position.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.840" offset="1868972">The other three courts are still standing by their positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.977" offset="1885586">Now, the facts in this case were essentially stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.112" offset="1902095">The company is in the business of laundering, rental, and distribution of linens and work uniforms.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.618" offset="1936159">Over a period of many years, or quite a number of years, the company, the Petitioner here, had engaged in multi-employer bargaining with a group of employers who dealt with the Teamsters Union for the driver employees of each of those companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.899" offset="2037305">Each company had a relatively small number of employees, and they all joined together in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.839" offset="2068966">In 1975, just prior to the expiration of the then current contract, the parties, the employers again joined together in this group, the Petitioner and nine other employers, and commenced bargaining with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.401" offset="2143258">The president of Petitioner was a member of the group's bargaining committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.288" offset="2170843">After a number of meetings, a proposed contract was submitted to the employees for ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.560" offset="2199891">The contract or the proposed contract provided for an increase in wages, and was based, as the previous contracts had been, on an hourly rate of pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.038" offset="2277841">The employees rejected that proposed contract, and the union came back at the next meeting and proposed that instead of the hourly rate of pay the employees be paid on a commission basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.381" offset="2343147">This was rejected by the employer's group.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.451" offset="2363418">Now, thereafter, and the parties have stipulated that, and the Board has found an impasse in bargaining was reached on May 15th, 1975, and the main issue in the impasse was whether or not the employees should be paid on a commission basis or the hourly basis.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="577.615" stopTime="591.856">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="577.615" offset="2444084">Well, Mr. Coven, you say the parties have stipulated that an impasse has been reached, and yet you say there is no generally accepted meaning of the term "impasse".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sidney_a_coven" startTime="591.856" stopTime="592.708">
            <label>Mr. Sidney A. Coven</label>
            <text syncTime="591.856" offset="2501031">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="592.708" stopTime="595.408">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="592.708" offset="2504479">Well, what kind of a stipulation is that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sidney_a_coven" startTime="595.408" stopTime="1021.045">
            <label>Mr. Sidney A. Coven</label>
            <text syncTime="595.408" offset="2515241">Well, I believe that the parties stipulated that whatever the Board defines as an impasse had been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.496" offset="2547633">In my view, as I said before, an impasse means that the parties have reached the point where they were just at loggerheads, and nobody was showing any signs of movement, and that is, I believe, what the parties stipulated to, and that is what the Board found.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.243" offset="2630598">On June 23rd, 1975, approximately five weeks or six weeks after the impasse had been reached, the union called a selective strike against only Petitioner, not all the rest of the employers, but only against Petitioner, one of the ten, and all of Petitioner's drivers joined the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.364" offset="2755150">Now, there is nothing in the record to indicate why the union chose the Petitioner only, why they didn't strike anybody else, but it stands to reason that we must assume that the union had some purpose in singling out the Petitioner, but as I say, the record doesn't show what that purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.676" offset="2836339">At that point, substantially all the other employers in the bargaining group locked out their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.383" offset="2875209">Thereafter, the parties all hired replacements, and continued to operate with the limitations of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.976" offset="2933514">Subsequently, there were a number of additional meetings between the union, the union and the negotiating committee of the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.486" offset="2995581">This went on for several months.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.855" offset="3005090">There were no results.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.038" offset="3009792">The parties were simply locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.389" offset="3019196">Neither party would move.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.258" offset="3026719">The union maintained that it wanted commissions, to be paid on a commission basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.960" offset="3049498">The employers refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.578" offset="3055976">And despite the efforts of a Federal mediator, there was no movement by either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.149" offset="3082203">This went on, as I say, for approximately six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.005" offset="3109684">During this period the Petitioner received information that two members of the group had been meeting secretly with the union, and although no separate agreements were reached, the Adminstrative Law Judge of the Board who heard this case specifically found</text>
            <text syncTime="765.268" offset="3194739">"that before Petitioner withdrew, two other employees in the group secretly had been in direct touch with the union, presumably in an effort to make a separate settlement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="779.243" offset="3250641">After the Petitioner learned of the secret meetings, it, by letter dated November 21st of 1975, and as I say, this was more than six months after the impasse, and almost five months after the strike against the Petitioner had started, the Petitioner notified the union and the employers' group that it was withdrawing from the group, and that it would thereafter bargain directly with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.864" offset="3369132">Now, on receipt of this notice by the group, the remaining members of the group terminated the lock-out and rehired all of the persons, the employees who had been previously locked out, and they all returned to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.855" offset="3421063">Thereafter, the group and the union continued to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.909" offset="3441334">At the first meeting held after the withdrawal, the union representative merely noted, without saying anything more, that the Petitioner had withdrawn, and the employers' group indicated or stated that another employer had been designated as a member of the group's negotiating committee to replace the Petitioner's president.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.493" offset="3551676">The parties had a number of meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.213" offset="3574559">There was no change in positions by either party until April the 13th of 1976, approximately four and a half months later, when the union finally receded from its insistence on payment on a commission basis, and agreement was reached on a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.259" offset="3646657">Thereupon, the union, which had never communicated with the Petitioner after receiving notice of withdrawal, advised the Petitioner that it considered it, the Petitioner, to be bound by the contract reached by the group, and at that point the Petitioner refused to sign the contract, stating that it was not bound since it had withdrawn from the group a long time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.826" offset="3752923">The union then filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.361" offset="3767134">The Board, after a hearing, found that an unfair labor practice had indeed occurred, although, as I stated before, five Courts which had considered that question prior to that point had held to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.308" offset="12870912">The union can call for a strike, the employers can engage in a lockout, the employer could hire replacements, the employer could make unilateral changes in working conditions rejected by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.516" offset="12923679">Now, in this particular case, all those things except maybe the working conditions, which didn't appear to be an issue, had been done, and yet the impasse continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.090" offset="12969968">Now, under those circumstances, isn't it reasonable to say that it was an unusual circumstance, after all those other things have been tried, because that is the purpose of letting them be tried?</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.933" offset="13029423">Well, those are merely examples of some of the things that could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.872" offset="13065158">They don't exhaust the... either the arsenal of the economic weapons that are available to the parties or what could be done to break the impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.048" offset="13125867">A mediator, for example, was not brought in, which is often the case, and does result in breaking the impasse, and the fact is that an agreement was ultimately reached here in the... in the multi-employer bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.764" offset="13228685">I know my brother would suggest that that was due to the withdrawal of Bonanno, but I submit that it is equally possible that that is not so, because the parties did not prior to Bonanno's leaving the unit, the record shows that there were those within the unit that thought that the way to break the impasse was to increase the wage offer that was being given to the union, and that was what was ultimately one of the ways in which the log jam was broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.514" offset="13423663">At that point the union withdrew its demand for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.083" offset="13446023">So, it is equally as fair an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.552" offset="13463891">I submit that Bonanno's departure retarded the forces that were building up, because it wasn't until several more months after he left that they finally got back on the track and worked out a solution to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.199" offset="13546438">The point of it is that the Board leaves insofar as possible to the parties the bargaining process, and doesn't sit in judgment in the economic weapons that they can use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.743" offset="13628672">As this Court has indicated many times, the use of economic weapons is part and parcel of the system of collective bargaining, and the Board's rule with respect... not regarding impasse as an unusual circumstance, I submit, is consistent with that general philosophy, and also with the practice of collective bargaining as it works in the... in the real world.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.706" offset="13932528">It follows that you need some rules to govern the conduct of that relationship, because if you can withdraw at will after negotiations have started, the unit becomes a bargaining lever in the negotiations, and experience has shown that that is not conducive to effective and efficient collective bargaining, because the parties have to know what the dimensions of the unit are before they can determine what offers they have to make, how much strength they have in the unit, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.359" offset="14155091">It is for that or those policy reasons that the Board has formulated the Retail Associates rules and why it has concluded that impasse alone is not an unusual enough circumstance to--</text>
