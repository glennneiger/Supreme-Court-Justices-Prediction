            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="166790">We will hear arguments next in Mills against Rogers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.754" offset="193748">Mr. Schultz, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="22.013" offset="254770">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in argument today I would like to focus on what the defendants believe to be the two fundamental reasons that there is no constitutional right to refuse treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.189" offset="311508">First would be that allowing one patient to refuse treatment is necessarily going to negatively impair the state's ability to perform its legitimate objective of maintaining order in its hospitals, and second of all, of treating those patients who are not themselves refusing treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.770" offset="397817">In other words, what I am saying is that to allow one patient to refuse treatment, there will necessarily be an increase of violence in our institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.227" offset="439613">The First Circuit talks about allowing forced medication for emergency situations, but they simply do not focus on the fact of the unpredictability of violence in mentally ill patients, the impulsivity of violent acts, the fact that mental patients are acting upon irrational thoughts, and that this simply cannot always be predicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.026" offset="538878">The second--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="94.026" stopTime="99.530">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="94.026" offset="542849">Well, they did give you a broader mandate than Judge Toro had done, didn't they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_schultz" startTime="99.530" stopTime="243.255">
            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="99.530" offset="564896">--There is no doubt that the First Circuit opinion in our mind is less wrong than the district court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.917" offset="590392">I could say that maybe less people will be hurt under the First Circuit opinion than would be hurt under the district court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.206" offset="623515">I hardly feel that justifies the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.241" offset="635740">The second point that I want to make as to this first fundamental reason is that if you allow one patient to remain in your hospital in a deteriorated state, this is going to affect the health of other patients, whether or not there is violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.732" offset="689657">A hospital is a milieu setting, and if you have patients who are deteriorated, this will set off the illnesses of other patients, and I will talk about this more later.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.689" offset="733543">The second major point that I want to discuss in argument today which we believe to be a second fundamental reason is that we suggest that the original decision to commit an individual against his will for treatment purposes when it is known at the time that the patient is committed that antipsychotic medications are a necessary part of the treatment of the vast majority of the seriously mentally ill acts as a sufficient predicate for the later administration of this medication against the patient's will after the commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.796" offset="877948">In other words, let me just reword what we consider this basic argument to be all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.016" offset="898846">There is no determination of incompetency at the time that a patient is committed, yet the state is empowered, despite this lack of a finding of incompetency, is empowered to commit an individual against his will for treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.762" offset="973765">We suggest similarly without any finding of incompetency the state should be empowered to carry out that treatment against the patient's will which was ordered at the time of commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.403" offset="1024338">In order to fully understand these two fundamental arguments that we believe necessitate there being a finding of no right to refuse treatment, I think it is first necessary to focus very, very briefly on what exactly is the role of antipsychotic medications in our state hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.097" offset="1091107">The record in this case is clear that antipsychotic medications are a necessary part of the treatment for the vast majority of seriously mentally ill patients.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="246.041" offset="1150875">They do, but they are not very good tranquilizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.059" offset="1162996">You shouldn't use them and it wouldn't be proper practice to use them as a tranquilizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.695" offset="1177520">They are a poor tranquilizer, and to the extent that they do tranquilize, the sedative effects wear off in two or three weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.515" offset="1200821">If you want to tranquilize, there are other drugs which are tranquilizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.385" offset="1216286">We are talking about a specific group of patients, and it must be recognized, and that group of patients are patients who are so seriously mentally ill that they could be committed, plus it is acceptable medical practice to use antipsychotic medications for those patients.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="279.195" offset="1283472">Mr. Schultz, do you disagree with the district court's findings about the drugs themselves, that they are mind-altering and they have significant side effects and so forth?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_schultz" startTime="290.486" stopTime="478.876">
            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="290.486" offset="1328717">I certainly disagree with the finding that they are mind-altering.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.772" offset="1341778">What they do is restore a chemical imbalance in the brain to the original balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.925" offset="1366437">It is the psychosis that is mind-altering, as I think a very cogent article points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.745" offset="1389739">The non-conformist treated of his illness, the psychotic non-conformist will remain a non-conformist.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.068" offset="1415025">A conformist treated of his illness will remain a conformist.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.501" offset="1424743">They don't alter the mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.853" offset="1430176">The psychosis alters the mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.137" offset="1435296">As for the effects, the side effects, there are side effects, but simply put, the state's position, and I think the First Circuit so found, is that the dangers of psychosis untreated are far greater than the dangers of any of these side effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.232" offset="1499662">The one other point that I can point out about the side effects is that there has sort of been a pendulum in the knowledge of these side effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.485" offset="1524635">At first there wasn't much knowledge of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.504" offset="1532785">Then everybody thought everything was a side effect, and now they are finding that the side effects are more limited than they thought, and are certainly more treatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.841" offset="1562147">Let me turn back to the question of what these medications are all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.828" offset="1582000">A point which the defendants want to emphasize is not only is the record clear that these medications are effective when taken voluntarily; the record is also overwhelming that these medications are effective when forcibly administered, the district court's finding notwithstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.207" offset="1655561">There is no way... To argue that these drugs are not administered... are not effective when administered forcibly simply ignores the tens of case histories in this case of patients who refused antipsychotic medication and deteriorated, and then against their will were forcibly medicated and improved, and there is simply no explanation for that other than the fact that these are chemicals, and they make the brain... they restore an imbalance, and this balance is restored whether or not a person voluntarily takes these medications or whether a person is forced to take these medications.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.613" offset="1797144">Let me turn to what the Commonwealth feels is another very important point in this case, and that is the recognition that we are talking about seriously mentally ill individuals, as the patients who have been given the right to refuse medication, and specifically, what do we know about the serious mental illness which is sufficient to commit an individual?</text>
            <text syncTime="430.145" offset="1887319">We know that an acutely psychotic patient is terrorized, in a state of panic, unbearable agony, pain, and distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.684" offset="1925458">That is undisputed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.168" offset="1931414">We know that schizophrenic patients, which are the majority of patients for whom it would be a proper practice to give antipsychotic medications, don't think rationally, that they think on their own autistic terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.509" offset="1980733">We know that a classic symptom of mental illness which leads these patients to being committed is ambivalence, including ambivalence to treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.783" offset="2017827">We know that... it is undisputed in the record that many, many patients who were forcibly medicated in the past, after they were forcibly medicated, thanked the doctors for forcibly medicating them when they weren't speaking their own true mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.376" offset="2076237">Now, despite--</text>

            <text syncTime="484.197" offset="2103508">The institution houses both voluntarily committed and involuntarily committed persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.767" offset="2125765">Is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="492.903" offset="2138303">I believe it is 90 percent voluntary and around 10 percent involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.871" offset="2158261">The reason for that is that in Massachusetts the laws changed in 1970 requiring you to, even if you could commit somebody, ask them if you wanted them to come in voluntarily, because they felt there would be a benefit to patients being voluntary patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.128" offset="2215208">There is not necessarily much of a difference in the illnesses between the two.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="535.994" offset="2310712">Yes, except that many of them... it used to be felt that you could ask them to leave the hospital and if you didn't you could forcibly medicate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.082" offset="2339028">Now what is happening is, after this opinion, if you feel they have to be forcibly medicated, they are making them involuntary patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.753" offset="2369748">So when the patient refuses medication now, there could well be a shift in this percentage, given if the kind of opinions that the First Circuit and the district court issued would have become the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.311" offset="2415933">I simply don't know the statistics as to whether or not there has been a change over the last several years.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.416" offset="2648423">Mr. Schultz, I would like to pursue something that may be somewhat similar to Justice Stevens' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.421" offset="2680397">As I understand it, the court of appeals required that an individualized estimation be made by the physicians in attendance of the possibility and type of violence in which the patient might engage, and the likely effects of the particular drugs on the patient, and an appraisal of the alternative means of treatment, and then if the physicians determine, having applied that standard, that the drug should be given, it may be given involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.045" offset="2826891">Now, I think that is what the court of appeals has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.913" offset="2838385">I also believe that that is the procedure that you have outlined in your brief that you assert the state follows anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.186" offset="2875479">Is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="678.704" offset="2881539">No, that is not right, because what they... first, what the court of appeals has done is, they set up two procedures for what they call dangerous patients and non-dangerous patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.391" offset="2916334">What happened before the temporary restraining order, there was no decision about dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.480" offset="2944651">It was recognized that this was not something which was predictable necessarily for these patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.868" offset="2966176">It was decided whether or not the medication was medically necessary on an individual basis, but there was never a decision made on, do I believe that because the possibility of dangerous outweighs the individual's private rights, which is what the individual decision has to be according to the First Circuit, that decision wasn't made.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.612" offset="3045170">Yes, it was an individual determination, but the questions that were asked were quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.649" offset="3061366">I want to go back to the point of who these patients are, because I want to talk briefly, because the state, I think, has been misconstrued on this point in both courts below, on who is this competent mentally ill patient that is talked about by the two courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.711" offset="3133569">The district court found that a majority of the committed patients are capable of appreciating the benefits, the risks, the side effects of these medications.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.954" offset="3190516">The Commonwealth suggests simply there is absolutely no basis in the record for that finding, but putting that aside, the major problem with both the district court opinion and the First Circuit opinion in this respect is that nobody discusses what they mean by such terms as appreciate, benefits, competent, or capability.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.701" offset="3273585">And it is quite one thing to say that a patient is able to understand that there may be risks to medication and to understand that he has been told he will get better if he is given the medication, and it is quite another thing to say that a seriously mentally ill patient can appreciate the benefits of being well when by definition part of his illness is that he doesn't understand that what he is is not well, and let me make the Commonwealth's position clear here.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.753" offset="3397719">We are not stating that a petition of commitment is the same as a legal finding of incompetency.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.779" offset="3677856">The second kind of patient is a patient who is a danger to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.748" offset="3693739">This person by definition has basically... has a distorted view of interpersonal relations with somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.752" offset="3721742">Classically, he is either in a state of rage or he is in a state of panic, a rage at somebody or a panic that somebody else is going to hurt him.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.925" offset="3750477">Yes, the rage and the panic may wax and wane on a given day or in a given period, but the basic underlying problem of his illness is that he doesn't understand that his rage or panic is unreasonable, and there is no way that patient can weigh the benefits of what the medication is going to be--</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.968" offset="4434571">Well, what they say is for the significant deterioration, and you run into two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.770" offset="4449827">First of all, what does significant mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.789" offset="4457872">You take the Rennie versus Klein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.474" offset="4468635">I will use that as an example of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.008" offset="4478770">This is an individual who slowly, when the district court told him he couldn't be forcibly medicated, he slowly deteriorated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.095" offset="4507087">Where was the significant deterioration?</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.130" offset="4519208">It was on a daily basis, until his life was endangered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.249" offset="4527776">Because of the district court opinion that you had to have a determination of incompetency, Mr. Rennie's life was unnecessarily endangered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.753" offset="4557765">So why not focus on significant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.772" offset="4565810">Second of all, you have the problem of, we are talking about a milieu setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.992" offset="4586708">What about the patient who is seriously ill, who is suffering, who is in agony and distress, but isn't deteriorating?</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.830" offset="4614085">He is already so deteriorated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.432" offset="4620459">What about that particular patient?</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.082" offset="4631117">I think it is important to maybe look again at some of the examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.101" offset="4647103">Maybe I can help answer your question by looking at some specifics of what is in the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.755" offset="4673748">I have an example of one of the plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.457" offset="4684615">Her name is Betty Bybel, and the testimony is that when Betty Bybel was deteriorated, not only could she become violent, but one thing she would do is sadistically taunt the other patients about their personal lives, causing a deterioration in their health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.236" offset="4751698">That wouldn't fall under any of these exceptions, yet under the First Circuit Betty Bybel is going to continue to cause the other patients to deteriorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.173" offset="4783463">The record is that when Betty Bybel would start yelling, everybody would start yelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.394" offset="4800286">That is not covered under either of those exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.078" offset="4811048">There is no significant deterioration in Betty Bybel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.362" offset="4820139">There is nothing about dangerousness, but the hospital is going wacky, and going... the hospital is going up at that time, because of the effect in the milieu, which is not discussed in either of the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.005" offset="4870712">You have an example of another patient, James Colleran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.974" offset="4886594">He would sadistically taunt female patients sexually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.942" offset="4902477">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.944" offset="4906552">For the female patients, you might have the question of dangerousness, but what happens is that he set up some of the male patients who had their own sexual hang-ups and couldn't stand James Colleran taunting the female patients, and the male patients' illnesses deteriorated, and there are just example upon example of example of these kinds of situations, and you must recognize that we are talking about a milieu here, we are talking about the state's ability to perform its legitimate objective of maintaining order in these hospitals, and neither opinion deals with this very fundamental reason that there should not be a right to refuse treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.548" offset="5552926">They are talking about another group of patients that is going to be set up that just didn't exist before, which is a group called incompetent patients but for whom there is going to be a substituted judgment that if they were competent they should be allowed to refuse, and those patients are going... somebody else is going to be allowed to say, they should be allowed to refuse their medication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.881" offset="6590300">Police power is talked about in terms of a policeman's ability to prevent dangerousness, and the defendant suggests that simply is not what the police power is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.254" offset="6627708">The police power, according to past cases in this Court, is the ability to protect the general welfare, including to protect the public health of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.760" offset="6661771">The Commonwealth would suggest that this ability to protect the public health is clearly implicated when you are talking about the need to treat patients against their will who have already been committed against their will for treatment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.520" offset="6720808">As to the parens patriae power, I simply want to say that this notion of competency seems to have been invented by the First Circuit to justify its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.042" offset="6754872">You will find nothing in the opinions of this Court that tie this variable competency that can change in one day, where one day you are competent and one day you are not competent, to the parens patriae power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.933" offset="6802519">The state is the sovereign, as a sovereign is the guardian over all idiots and lunatics, according to the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.787" offset="6833866">This Court has never mentioned incompetency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.872" offset="6842225">This notion of incompetency, the Commonwealth would suggest, is one that has been brought in from the rear to justify the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.728" offset="6877647">It simply is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.028" offset="6882872">The parens patriae powers and the police powers are more than adequate to justify the actions taken by the doctors in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.934" offset="8810499">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to try to clear up two comments that were made at the end of the argument in terms of commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.088" offset="8839130">The Roe case specifically dealt with whether or not merely because someone is being committed for dangerous in the community, dangerousness in the community, whether it means that a person would be necessarily dangerous in the hospital, the Supreme Judicial Court said specifically it does not mean, and I will give an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.049" offset="8906943">Someone may be dangerous to their family because hey are having problems with their family, and they are dangerous, and they are put in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.286" offset="8931917">Now, they cannot be discharged, because if they are again discharged into the community, they would be dangerous in the community, does not necessarily mean that they would be dangerous in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.309" offset="8967966">In fact, the district court found as a matter of fact, based on the evidence presented by the defendants, that only 25 percent of the patients in the hospital are in fact potentially dangerous, and I will address that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.052" offset="9022927">Second of all, in terms of the practice dealing with voluntary patients, they were treated specifically like involuntary patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.573" offset="9053020">What happened was that patients weren't told that they had a right to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.943" offset="9070470">They were told that if they refused their drugs, they would be forcibly medicated, and that if they tried to leave, they threatened them with commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.797" offset="9101921">So there wasn't such a thing that... they are called conditional voluntary patients, where the patient has to give three day notice to the hospital, and during that period of time the hospital has the right to petition, and the record was consistent in the patients who testified and staff who testified that patients were threatened that if they did refuse and they tried to leave, that they would attempt to commit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.127" offset="9187290">I would like now to go to certain brief points concerning this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.722" offset="9265657">Most patients, at least the testimony that we have from staff and patients was that the patient would not sign the voluntary... or withdraw the voluntary under the threat of commitment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.990" offset="9474741">Now, 85 percent of the patient population were either patients who were chronic patients or patients who had been rehospitalized previously, and one can assume by both the evidence in the case and as petitioner says that almost all those patients had antipsychotic drug experience in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.035" offset="9546839">Secondly, this is not a situation in which if patients are provided with the right to refuse antipsychotic drugs, that many patients will be without treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.942" offset="9594486">Now, the petitioners have here asked for de novo review of a number of facts found by the district court after a 72-day trial, a voluminous record with testimony which... some of it was in dispute, but which the district court found... but the district court found, and based on... by statements made by the defendants themselves, that the vast majority of patients after the district court order accepted some form of antipsychotic drug, though not necessarily the drug or dosage the doctors originally prescribed, as long as the doctors tried to use discourse to discuss with the patient the risks and benefits rather than the previous practice of using force on the patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.484" offset="9748713">Now, this was a different practice, and the defendants admitted, there are admissions in the record that the defendants' practice in the past was for patients, some patients who were able to make rational decisions, that they would ignore or disregard patients' complaints about the adverse side effects, and medicate them anyway because the doctors believed that it was in their best medical interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4775.180" offset="19267420">In Roe, they said there are three factors that they are deciding that case on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.401" offset="19288318">They said, on the Constitution, on the power over guardians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.853" offset="19302111">Now, certainly that is not relevant in this case, because we are discussing whether or not a guardian has to be appointed in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.174" offset="19323427">And then they said, on the common law, and quoted one New York case for the common law talking about what are basic liberty interests, which is the exact same question you would ask as to what constitutionally under the Fourteenth Amendment is a basic liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.182" offset="19379433">Roe is a constitutional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.200" offset="19387583">Roe doesn't decide on any statutes or on any Massachusetts regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.586" offset="19405033">It is a constitutional case which is reviewable by this Court, which didn't have the record that this Court has to decide what is the effect on an institution of allowing patients to refuse treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.559" offset="19449023">If one were to certify, one would have to send down the entire 74-day record, and have the SJC look at that record to decide what the effect on institutions would be.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="4839.105" offset="19523107">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.623" offset="19525197">They say it four times, and why... the other side is saying it is definitive, but if a court ever went... they are right, we intervened in Roe, and what did the Commonwealth do when they intervened in Roe?</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.495" offset="19568769">We said, don't interfere with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.364" offset="19576188">This case... Roe does not involve institutionalized patients, and I wrote half of my brief saying don't interfere with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.369" offset="19608266">And they bought it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.636" offset="19613281">Four times in their opinions, they say, we are not interfering with the Rogers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.938" offset="19630522">And I just don't know how it could be any clearer under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.642" offset="19645255">I briefly want to mention just, I think, a very basic issue that Justice O'Connor raised, and that is, how many states determine incompetency at the time of commitment?</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.881" offset="19690290">According to the psychiatric brief, they state one, and I will take it as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.937" offset="19714532">Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.537" offset="19716935">And what the Commonwealth asks is, if you have to determine competency to treat a person against his will, why can you commit that person against his will for treatment without that same determination of incompetency?</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.613" offset="19773151">And what is really being challenged in this case is the commitments in those 49 states, because those people were not committed for dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.117" offset="19803244">You can't commit anybody because he is dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.902" offset="19814320">That is preventive detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.421" offset="19820380">They were committed because they were dangerous by reason of mental illness, which the mental illness means they are either subject to care or treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.775" offset="19853817">We don't necessarily say everybody is treatable, but we are saying that to the extent that they are treatable, that that is why they were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.297" offset="19887881">Dangerous by reason of mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.899" offset="19898330">Not dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.849" offset="19902091">It doesn't make sense to talk about police power commitments, to say that the state's interest is satisfied when they are taken off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.005" offset="19930721">The state's interest is not taking people off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.773" offset="19941797">The state cannot go around saying, you are dangerous, you are dangerous, you are dangerous, you should go off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.344" offset="19964158">They have to show beyond a reasonable doubt in Massachusetts that they are dangerous by reason of mental illness, or that they are incapable of taking care of themselves by reason of mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.150" offset="20003342">The state can't send somebody to a mental hospital simply because they are incapable of taking care of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.270" offset="20023822">I think the parens patriae power might let them send them some place else, but why are they sent to a mental hospital?</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.941" offset="20046496">Because they are mentally ill, and we suggest that this is a fundamental question which has been overlooked by both lower courts.</text>
