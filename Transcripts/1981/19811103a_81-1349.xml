            <text syncTime="61.086" offset="387549">The petitioner in this matter, the state, feels there are three principal issues which the petitioner feels necessary to discuss in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.494" offset="433211">The first issue is whether or not exigent circumstances existed in this case that would have excused the officer of first procuring a search warrant prior to his entry into the dorm room and seizure of the marihuana seeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.189" offset="495905">Secondly, whether or not it was proper for the law enforcement officer to accompany the arrestee, Mr. Overdahl, to the dorm room when he asked to be allowed to return to that premises to secure ID from the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.484" offset="569152">And thirdly, if this Court should determine that the officer acted in violation of the Fourth Amendment on the first two questions, whether or not this is an appropriate case for the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule to be applied to.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.410" offset="636862">In other words, whether or not the Court should look at the good faith of the officer in this particular case and apply a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="132.634" offset="673747">Is the basic predicate of your case that if an arresting officer has probable cause to make an arrest and does so, he may keep the arrested person at least in sight if not in hand from that point on?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald R. Carpenter</label>
            <text syncTime="150.346" offset="744591">That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.613" offset="749606">Our approach is that in order to protect both the officer and protect other members of society, protect the arrestee himself and protect the evidence from being destroyed, it is nonsensical to suggest that the officer should allow the arrestee out of his immediate control and presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.324" offset="820450">And in order to that, if he wants to be a reasonable, polite, courteous officer, wants to do what this officer tried to do, try to conduct himself in a low key, professional manner particularly on a college campus, he needed to afford the arrestee the opportunity to return to his premises, and that's basically what we're saying.</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.781" offset="14178321">It's true that it did cite a state case, State v. Daugherty, which cites a whole series of other state cases, but those state cases are talking about interpretation of the U.S. Constitution primarily; they're not talking about the U.S. Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.458" offset="14237045">The only case of recent times that is helpful to underline any disparity in the two constitutions is State v. Simpson which talks about the standing problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.605" offset="14317606">And it's only that point of departure on standing that our court made a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.675" offset="14337877">I think the record is helpful in some of the things we've been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.460" offset="14353028">I'd ask the Court when it has a chance to look at the Joint Appendix Page 35, and I think that clearly shows the trial court's findings of fact, which show that it was Mr. Overdahl's desire to go back to the room, and that his response to the office was okay, he could accompany him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.570" offset="14413528">Also, a fact that got maybe lost in the wash a little bit here is that the third violation, also a criminal violation, was that... and it's replete in the Joint Appendix references... is that it's a violation of criminal law and Washington law to have an open container out in public, and that's another reason the officer could have arrested him, and one of the reasons he cites at the suppression hearing in the trial court.</text>
