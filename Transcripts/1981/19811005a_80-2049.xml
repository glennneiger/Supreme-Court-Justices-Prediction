            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="57.020" offset="367255">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether a Federal prisoner serving a sentence under the Youth Corrections Act, who commits a crime and is sentenced to a consecutive term of imprisonment as an adult, must continue to be treated as a Youth Corrections Act offender for the remainder of his Youth Corrections Act term.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.735" offset="466102">In 1974, the Respondent in this case, Mr. Robinson, was convicted of second degree murder in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.341" offset="504554">The maximum punishment for that offense is life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.395" offset="520750">The Respondent was sentenced to ten years under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, or YCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.899" offset="546768">The YCA permits a Judge as an alternative to imposing an adult sentence to commit an offender under the age of 22 to the Bureau of Prisons for a program of treatment designed to correct his antisocial tendencies and restore him to a normal, productive, and law-abiding life.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.128" offset="627748">Not to fit in with a group of hardened criminals.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Strauss</label>
            <text syncTime="126.514" offset="645302">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.914" offset="646869">There is no suggestion that Congress intended it for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.549" offset="657423">Congress intended also that the YCA be modeled on the English Borstal system, and provided as one aspect of YCA treatment that YCA offenders be segregated insofar as practical from other classes of offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.409" offset="720848">In 1975, while he was serving his YCA sentence, the Respondent was convicted of assaulting a Federal correctional officer with a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.735" offset="770167">The Judge before whom he was convicted expressly declined to sentence him under the YCA, found that the Respondent would not benefit further from YCA treatment, and sentenced him as an adult to a five and a half year term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.911" offset="834847">The Judge specified that this sentence was to run consecutively to the YCA term, and recommended that the Respondent be moved from the youth facility where he had been being confined to a more secure institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.754" offset="894197">Two years later, in 1977, the Respondent was again convicted of assaulting a Federal prison guard, and although he was not yet 22, he was again sentenced to an adult term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.446" offset="960966">This time the sentence was one year and a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.146" offset="971833">The Judge specified that this sentence was to run consecutively to his other two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.550" offset="993358">When the Respondent received his adult sentences, he acquired a dual status; although he was still serving a YCA term, he was also under an adult sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.141" offset="1047797">At this point, the Bureau of Prisons, following an established policy for dealing with dual status offenders, began treating the Respondent in prison as an adult offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.531" offset="1097325">The effect of this was that the Respondent was given access to those treatment programs designed for adults as opposed to those programs designed for youthful offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.287" offset="1132329">In doing this, the Bureau was exercising a power that is possessed by correctional authorities under the Borstal system, the English Borstal system, which as I said was the model for the YCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.047" offset="1183425">In that system, the authorities could transfer an offender from a youth institution to an adult prison in a case like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.997" offset="1391150">That is our position, but we do have the second conviction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.848" offset="1402644">In 1978, the Respondent brought this action to challenge the Bureau's policy by filing a pro se document in the United States District Court, in which he sought to be segregated from adult offenders, and to be treated according to the provisions of the YCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.579" offset="1477563">The District Court ordered relief, ordering that Respondent be moved to an institution where he would be segregated and would receive YCA treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.618" offset="1517687">At the time the District Court granted relief, the Respondent, because of his two adult convictions, and because he had compiled an extensive disciplinary record in prison, including several violent incidents, was in the control unit of the United States Penetentiary at Marion, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.762" offset="1594278">That is the most secure unit of the most secure facility in the Federal prison system.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.667" offset="1641926">The Seventh Circuit affirmed the District court's order, and on our petition this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.023" offset="1679333">The Respondent relies on the provisions of the YCA, which prescribe segregation and treatment for YCA offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.080" offset="1727503">The segregation requirement, as Respondent virtually concedes, and as, in any event, this Court has said and the legislative history demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt, was intended to allow the Bureau to insulate YCA offenders from the corrupting influence of more hardened, experienced adult offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.178" offset="1811931">The Respondent is precisely the sort of offender from whom YCA offenders are supposed to be segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.285" offset="1852368">He is under two adult sentences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.230" offset="6448143">Number one, the mootness argument presumes that this Court will not act expeditiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.566" offset="6469459">I will not indulge in that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.818" offset="6478445">But if one were to indulge that presumption, I would like to point out that in January 1982, Mr. Robinson will only be conditionally released from this YCA sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.392" offset="6528809">At that point he will start serving his adult sentence, and should he be paroled within two years, he would still be subject to the YCA sentence and could be called back into the YCA system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.477" offset="11653093">We are saying he is a hardened criminal, and a failure of the system, when the system really didn't exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.632" offset="13317720">We do not believe that the Act has to be interpreted in a manner which raises those issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.014" offset="13415314">In Thompson versus Carlson, the Third Circuit clearly said to the Bureau of Prisons, you cannot unilaterally revoke this man's status.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.959" offset="13483023">The Courts have uniformly held that, other than the Fourth Circuit's decision in Outing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.361" offset="13500682">That is the only decision, and an early decision in Abernathy, which I do not think adequately addressed the issues, but all the other Courts have said, including Thompson versus Carlson, you do not have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.854" offset="13554598">Thompson versus Carlson said, though, that the second Judge in imposing the sentence terminated the first youth corrections sentence, and we believe the Seventh Circuit was clearly correct in holding that that was not the effect of the second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.732" offset="13630145">Indeed, the consecutive adult sentence may have been imposed in Mr. Robinson's case, as the Seventh Circuit pointed out, precisely because he was serving then a youth corrections sentence, and the Court might have imposed a youth corrections sentence otherwise.</text>
