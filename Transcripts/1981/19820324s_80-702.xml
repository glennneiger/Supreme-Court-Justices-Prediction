            <text syncTime="14.450" offset="135226">United States against New Mexico comes to us by way of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.511" offset="171484">The issue is the extent to which a State may impose taxes on contractors that conduct business with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.586" offset="207742">New Mexico imposes a gross receipts tax and a compensating use tax on those who do business within that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.703" offset="240238">The Sandia Corporation and the Zia Company have contracts with the Government to manage certain Government-owned atomic laboratories in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.063" offset="285691">And Los Alamos Constructors has a contract for construction and repair work at one of the laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.898" offset="316934">The contracts use an “advanced funding” procedure to meet costs and by this procedure, the contractor is allowed to pay creditors and employees also with drafts drawn on a special bank account in which federal funds are deposited.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.147" offset="393943">The United States brought suit in federal courts seeking a declaratory judgment that the New Mexico taxes do not apply to these contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.923" offset="429051">The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.331" offset="446710">And the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.711" offset="456219">It took the view that the relationships between the Government and the contractors did not so incorporate the latter into the Government structure as to make them "instrumentalities of the United States" immune from the New Mexico taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.043" offset="525600">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirmed that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.152" offset="545975">We hold that the contractors are not protected by the constitutions guarantee of federal supremacy despite the fact that the tax had an effect on the Federal Government and despite the fact that the United States shoulders the economic burden of the levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.649" offset="612013">Immunity is appropriate only where the state levy falls on the United States itself or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.404" offset="675020">That decision is unanimous.</text>
