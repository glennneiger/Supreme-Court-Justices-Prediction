            <text syncTime="65.833" offset="398603">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the petition of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, which as you know is frequently referred to in the record as ASME, submits that this case casts up in simple terms the following issue, and that is the question of on what basis can the acts of two of the society's voluntary members of this non-profit, scientific and technical society be imputed to that society for purposes of establishing liability under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.254" offset="568295">Now, the panel below answered this question substantially as follows, and I am really quoting in large measure from Page 19 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.201" offset="620017">The panel said, for ASME to be liable then, Hydrolevel, the plaintiff, had to demonstrate only that ASME's agents, that is, two voluntary members, acted within their apparent authority when participating in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.819" offset="694518">It, Hydrolevel, did not have to demonstrate that they also acted in part to benefit ASME or that ASME ratified their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.595" offset="745614">We contend that this holding is incorrect, and that this Court should reverse the reasoning and judgment of liability entered by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.528" offset="789395">Now, the facts which set the stage for this relatively simply stated issue here in this Court--</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold R. Tyler, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="283.511" offset="1269317">I understand that.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="harold_r_tyler_jr" startTime="285.760" stopTime="669.931">
            <label>Mr. Harold R. Tyler, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="285.760" offset="1278303">But we claim that the sufficiency of evidence point here is very acute, and we stand on the proposition that if you look at the facts, there is no basis, whether we are talking about apparent authority, actual authority to hold this society, particularly when the agents were not working for the society when they did what they did to bring themselves into the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.780" offset="1378404">Let me just repeat these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.982" offset="1391152">I am sure you will recall most of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.904" offset="1398884">The facts which set up the legal issues here really occurred in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.151" offset="1427828">In March of that year, two long-time members of the society, one of them a man named James who then was the vice president of McDonald and Miller, which then and now was a major manufacturer and distributor of low water cutoff devices for pressure vessels and boilers, Hardin, who was the vice president of Hartford C. Boyler, a big insurance company, sat down in the Drape Hotel for dinner with some other officers of McDonald and Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.059" offset="1563456">For our purposes, the principal subject of talking was how they could use the knowledge of Hardin and James to put a letter in in the normal course or what appeared to be the normal course to the Boiler Pressure Vessel Committee of ASME and to get an answer which might help McDonald and Miller or M&amp;M compete against Hydrolevel unfairly in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.267" offset="1676305">Hydrolevel, as you will recall, at the time was a small company, had never had any commercial success, but had developed a so-called probe type of low water cutoff device for boilers, which incorporated a time principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.697" offset="1738058">As a result of that meeting in Chicago, a letter was prepared with the help of Hardin and James, signed by a man named Mitchell, a sales official of M&amp;M, sent in what purported to be in the regular course to this committee of ASME.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.362" offset="1816634">It came into the hands of the secretary of the committee, a man named Hoyt, who in the regular course transmitted it to Hardin, who was then chairman of the relevant subcommittee of the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.308" offset="1872432">It appears quite clear that Hardin had something to do, a great deal to do with the preparation of the response which went out to M&amp;M on or about April 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.318" offset="1936484">Hydrolevel's counsel suggests that Hardin did this almost alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.566" offset="1961457">That isn't quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.284" offset="1972324">It is true, however, that James, oddly enough, wasn't visible at that time, and hence it seems to us he can't be held to have had any apparent authority because he really wasn't visible.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.981" offset="2023211">In any case, the loaded letter got a loaded response.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.196" offset="2056020">And after that, the record is perfectly clear that sales representatives of M&amp;M went out into the marketplace and used this letter unfairly to depreciate, if you will, the Hydrolevel prop.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.285" offset="2108370">Now, I will stop there, although of course there are other facts in the record, and I am sure not only my opponents but perhaps myself will get to those, but these are really sufficient to set up the legal problem, because we contend that contrary to what the court of appeals held, these facts show that these two men, Hardin and James, or one of them, weren't acting to benefit the society at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.194" offset="2231981">They quite clearly were acting to benefit another principal, McDonald and Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.911" offset="2254865">Now, to step back a moment, you will remember in the court of appeals there were two issues of liability that Hydrolevel and ASME addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.015" offset="2303348">First, Hydrolevel contended that on these simple facts, Hardin and James appeared to be acting as members of the society, and therefore somehow they had actual authority to join this anticompetitive scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.195" offset="2375968">We argued to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.258" offset="2384223">In addition to that, Hydrolevel said, look, if we are wrong about actual authority, later on, somehow, the society, with full awareness of what was going on, ratified what Hardin and James were up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.235" offset="2452141">The court of appeals didn't really confront either of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.702" offset="2470009">They came to an apparent authority analysis of this case, as you know, and it is something which neither side did brief at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.776" offset="2506371">Now, very briefly, we contend that whether we are dealing with relevant, appropriate provisions of master and servant law or agency law, and furthermore, if you look at settled law on what it takes to have someone become a member of a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade under the Sherman Act, the court of appeals analysis just doesn't hold water.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.324" offset="2636566">Now, you will recall that the court of appeals does refer to in its opinion a number of sections of the restatement of agency, which they say fit this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.897" offset="2694871">It is interesting because those sections in the 240s, if you look in the table of contents of the restatement of agency, it is instructive to see that those are regarded by the draftsman as dealing with specific and limited torts of an agent, and thus permitting under certain circumstances tying in those agents, masters, or principals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.255" offset="4724272">But if you will analyze the case in its entirety, you will see, quite obviously, unlike here, the employer in question was in commerce, at least in the commerce subject of the case, and the employees were acting in the scope of their employment, doing the things they shouldn't have been doing under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.948" offset="4819044">We have no quarrel with that kind of holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.636" offset="4829807">This presents quite a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.540" offset="4845376">Here is a society which by statute and as a practical matter is made up of about 100,000 individuals, now, not companies, not firms, and here were Hardin and James, sitting down and agreeing with a commercial organization, which is a competitor of Hydrolevel, we can do some things to skew the procedures of the society to help you in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.637" offset="4961777">That wasn't done to benefit the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.058" offset="4971495">That is quite different from the case you cite, and others, Hilton Hotels and others, as you quite perceptively point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.179" offset="5007962">We really discuss in large measure both sides here, a lot of these cases, but we say that it is important to keep this distinction in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.738" offset="5046205">Let me turn to something else which the court of appeals did which standing alone the case is still a god case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.750" offset="5078283">You remember, they decided that this turned on something called the Gleason case, which was decided in the late 1920s, and counsel for Hydrolevel, of course, understandably relies on that, and that was a case where, unlike here, the plaintiff was seeking to recover compensatory damages only against a common carrier, where the facts show very clearly that the agent was really faithless to his master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.752" offset="5222270">And there, this Court held, and we do not quarrel with that holding, that for purposes of allocating risk of loss to a plaintiff like this, or put differently, to allow a plaintiff to be compensated, the principal would be changed even though he didn't know at the time what the agent was up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.618" offset="5313699">However, we say that this Court long ago recognized that distinction in a case which oddly enough was handed down by this Court two years after the Sherman Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.566" offset="5361451">It is a great case to read, not just because we think it supports us, but because it analyzes both themes or threads of authority in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.842" offset="5402620">First, Mr. Justice Gray, writing for this Court, said, look, the law... he discussed for the Court the evolution of common law in certain classes of cases where to allocate the risk of loss to somebody's damage, the courts would permit the imputation of liability for compensatory damages to such a plaintiff, where it was clear from the record that the principal didn't know what was going on, and the agent seemed to be seeking to benefit himself and not the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.876" offset="5550786">But then, the case facing this Court, and it is called, by the way, Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway versus Prentiss... it is in our reply brief... Mr. Justice Gray said, but there is another rule where a plaintiff goes further and seeks to get exemplary, deterrent, or punitive damages, and there the law is that that plaintiff will have to show that the principal of this agent benefitted from what he was up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.721" offset="5682130">Now, that seems to me to go back to what you raised, Justice White, and today, that case is followed consistently by the lower federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.981" offset="5719119">It is the federal rule, we maintain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.277" offset="5732389">Therefore, to sum all this up, we say that on the peculiar facts of this case, about which there is no dispute, here we have a plaintiff which admittedly had other remedies which it abandoned in the court below for suing ASME, for example, for what New York calls a prima facie tort, plaintiff now seeking to recover treble damages against this society, even though the plaintiff well knows that the society didn't have the requisite understanding of the Sherman Act cases to know that an anticompetitive scheme was going on, and received no benefit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl W. Schwarz</label>
            <text syncTime="1452.319" offset="5944504">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this appeal is from a jury verdict finding the defendant, ASME, liable for treble damages under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, a verdict rendered upon instructions from the trial judge that are not being challenged on appeal, as we have just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.790" offset="6070414">Indeed, the jury's conclusion that the law was violated is also not being challenged, but is expressly conceded by the ASME.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.802" offset="6106463">The only issue before this court is whether the ASME, as a corporation, is to be held responsible under the doctrine of respondeat superior for the damage caused by that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.000" offset="6159230">With the Court's indulgence, I would like to make two observations at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.952" offset="6179083">First, there were two physical exhibits introduced at the trial, the two devices in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.918" offset="6202907">We have brought them here so that the Court can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.715" offset="6214087">This is the probe; this is the float.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.837" offset="6230597">I need not go into the description of how they work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.789" offset="6246375">They are adequately covered in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.429" offset="6256928">The second observation I would like to make at the outset involves one of the amicus curiae briefs that were filed on behalf of Hydrolevel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.908" offset="6298829">The brief of Adolph Ackerman, who is an ASME member, and one of the amicus curiae, developed in his brief, one which I highly recommend to the Court, that the ASME's presentation in this Court totally fails to address two principles that are basic to agency law, and that should be most important to every professional, and particularly the professional societies that administer standards that have the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.083" offset="6427560">Those two principles are duty and responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.035" offset="6443338">Those that assume a great responsibility should have a corresponding great duty, not only to Hydrolevel for fair treatment, not only to the public at large for setting standards that promote competition and do not entrench monopolists, but to itself and its own members, as Mr. Ackerman points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.089" offset="6531632">I listened in vain to my brother's presentation and the words "duty" and "responsibility" were never mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.319" offset="6560471">The case as presented to the court of appeals involved only the question, as my brother has pointed out, whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's conclusion that the ASME's agents were at least in part, at least in part, acting on behalf of or for the benefit of the ASME, or secondly, whether the ASME by its subsequent acts and statements or failures to act ratified the unlawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.072" offset="6691501">The court of appeals found it unnecessary to reach these two questions, because it decided that a third principle of respondeat superior, that of apparent authority, had clearly been satisfied, and justified the imposition of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.066" offset="6751478">I would like in my presentation first to explain why the decision of the court of appeals was correct, and then to demonstrate why there are two alternative grounds for affirmance, that of actual authority with intent to benefit and ratification, and I note in this respect that this is one point on which my brother and I are in full agreement, that these issues should be addressed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.430" offset="6852938">He said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.227" offset="6856177">I say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.446" offset="6860984">And I believe we are entitled to address them both under the questions presented under which this petition for certiorari was granted, which, if you care to look at them, at the front of the brief of my opponent, raise and involve the questions of actual authority and ratification, and under the doctrine of the two cases, Dandridge versus Williams and Dayton versus Brinkman, which permit, I believe, a respondent to urge affirmance on any ground, even though it is not specifically addressed, although in this case it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.336" offset="7324605">Your Honor, on the ASME's challenge to the holding of the court of appeals with respect to the issue of apparent authority, it really is on two levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.614" offset="7361699">First, it argues that because the doctrine of apparent authority does not require an intent to benefit, which all agree is the case, even though the ASME suggested a charge to the jury which the district court adopted to the contrary, that that doctrine should not be available in any antitrust case, and as a matter of fact, they argued that it should not be available in any case with even arguably punitive aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.150" offset="7471831">It is, the argument goes, somehow unfair to punish the principal for acts of dishonest or disloyal agents where those acts were not intentionally authorized by or known to the principal, and where those acts were not intended to benefit the principal by the disloyal agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.421" offset="7580918">Your Honor, with respect to the apparent agency issue, apparent authority issue, I think all agree now that the issue of benefit is not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.495" offset="7613206">Whether there was benefit or no benefit, the important thing, as the court of appeals pointed out at some length, is whether there was an aura of agency and authority imposed upon the agent by the principal which was relied upon by third parties to the detriment in this case of Hydrolevel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.426" offset="7684990">Now, I submit that if this Court accepts that argument, it would be rejecting the very reasons for the existence and development of the law of respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.921" offset="7726891">It would be overturning decades of settled law, and that law has never made any exceptions to the application of respondeat superior law or the law of agency to particular cases such as this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.392" offset="8160837">In that case, the two disloyal and dishonest agents were stealing from the principal, and the court of appeals was faced with a situation where the government was arguing that the intent, the dishonest intent of the two employees that were stealing from the principal should be imputed to the principal for purposes of criminal prosecution of the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.272" offset="8268357">In those circumstances, I have no quarrel with the holding of the court of appeals that that is not the result that should follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.399" offset="8716827">In an actual authority situation, the principal is bound by the exercise of authority he actually gives to the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.801" offset="8754443">In an apparent authority situation, the principal is bound by the exercise of authority he represents to the world that the agent has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.172" offset="8791955">The two are not mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.469" offset="8801150">An agent may and frequently does have both actual and apparent authority from the principal, and that, we submit, is exactly what is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.230" offset="8840125">Even the doctrine of inherent agency power, which we point out in our brief, requires no specific authority at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.040" offset="8875442">In neither of those cases, actual of apparent authority, is the principal bound on a theory of negligence, except insofar as he has made a poor choice of agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.909" offset="8922881">In both cases, the principal is bound by his own act of conferring actual or apparent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.468" offset="8953078">Now, apparent authority is not, as the ASME would have this Court believe, an exception to the general rule of respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.231" offset="8992158">Fraud and the other torts that were mentioned by my brother during his presentation is no less a conventional tort than assault, and I submit that apparent authority is designed and has always been a part of the law of respondeat superior simply to take into account those types of torts where it can most commonly occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.314" offset="9088497">That rule of apparent authority has been around as long as the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.515" offset="9109291">If Congress had intended that corporations or non-profit associations were to be liable only for anticompetitive acts expressly authorized or ratified by the board of directors of a corporation, or intended to benefit the corporation, it could have easily done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.258" offset="9192256">As a matter of fact, as the court of appeals pointed out, the fact that the antitrust laws are so basic to this country's economy makes it that much more important that the courts not remove any legal incentive for antitrust vigilance on behalf of industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.673" offset="9253905">The second level of the ASME's argument on apparent authority is that even if apparent authority is applied to other corporations, industrial corporations, it should be not available against non-profit corporations such as the ASME, because they are organized only to do good things for the public, and they should not have to bear the terrible financial risks that the antitrust laws impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.943" offset="9359021">I suggest that there is nothing in the legislative history of the antitrust laws to suggest that Congress intended any special treatment for any class of persons, and the definition of persons in the Sherman and the Clayton Acts clearly encompasses non-profit as well as even eleemosynary institutions such as churches and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.512" offset="9449300">I suggest that the opposite is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.356" offset="9456615">It is more important to continue the apparent authority concept in effect against non-profit corporations because otherwise they would be exempt from the antitrust laws altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.336" offset="9500605">The proposition advanced by my opposition that everything done by the ASME is for the benefit of the public, and not for the benefit of the ASME, means that it could never be held responsible for any unlawful act except through an apparent authority concept or by direct ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.436" offset="9576987">I would like to address one point that I think is important from the context of the brief of the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.448" offset="9613036">It is said frequently, what could we have done to avoid this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.775" offset="9630381">We have 10,000 people writing codes, 100,000 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.570" offset="9649503">What could the ASME have done to avoid what happened to Hydrolevel?</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.959" offset="9667057">The ASME suggests that it is being asked to pay astronomical damages for something caused by only two disloyal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.097" offset="9703629">I submit that very few basic changes in the way they do business would protect the ASME quite nicely, and at the same time purge the organization of those volunteers like John James who are serving the ASME only because of the influence they can extract from it on behalf of their employers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="2772.238" offset="11224164">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States contends that the court of appeals correctly upheld the jury's verdict imposing liability on ASME.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.500" offset="11269199">I would like first to explain why the jury's verdict should be sustained, and then describe the serious adverse effects which would result from acceptance of ASME's contrary theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.106" offset="11311622">As the briefs in the record in this case vividly demonstrate, private organizations which prescribe standards for products sold in interstate commerce have great power to improve economic performance and great power to inflict economic harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.504" offset="11373271">Standardmaking activities can facilitate commerce by increasing consumer information and by promoting product safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.986" offset="11403155">However, those activities also can deprive consumers of new and valuable products, and inflict serious injury on competitors, dangers which are heightened by conflicts of interest which often are present in codemaking bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.387" offset="11460833">The code interpretation which caused the competitive harm in this case appears as the first appendix to the red brief filed by Hydrolevel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.801" offset="12614401">That is quite correct, and I do acknowledge that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.472" offset="12625163">However, this Court's decisions have treated non-profit entities on a par with other profitmaking entities in the past, and we think the same approach is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.295" offset="12664451">ASME nonetheless argues that codemaking bodies in the situation should be able to rely on a plea of unawareness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.464" offset="12697052">This, we submit, if accepted, would undermine the incentives that Congress created under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.915" offset="12718891">If courts were to accept this plea, it would encourage codemaking bodies to look the other way in the face of the ever present danger of anticompetitive behavior by officers with conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.692" offset="12766016">Effective deterrence of anticompetitive behavior in organizations such as ASME is of crucial importance to the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.469" offset="12801124">As the House Subcommittee on Small Business stated in its Report Number 1981, in the 90th Congress, Second Session, at Page 75, and I quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.754" offset="12914287">If ASME wishes to take upon itself authority to render interpretations that have life or death importance for American businesses, it must also take responsibility for the actions of those persons to whom it commits codemaking power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.232" offset="12972174">It is clear enough that ASME is willing to take credit for the achievements of its codemaking officers, and to receive many millions of dollars annually from the sale of its codes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.119" offset="14399713">Like I assume many of us here, I am a member of the bar association, the City Bar of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.758" offset="14422283">I am an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.569" offset="14425522">I am a member of the executive committee, and thus I would have power to go to, let's say, the ethics committee in that bar association, and because I wanted to serve my law firm, not the bar association, I saw a chance to diminish a competing firm which had a very juicy client if I could skew up an opinion of the ethics committee dealing with the behavior of that law firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.982" offset="14527191">I would think we would all agree, no one would want to say that the City Bar of the city of New York was liable for my faithless conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.696" offset="14570032">I wasn't acting for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.523" offset="14577346">I was using their authority in a very real sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.334" offset="14596572">I was masquerading using their trappings, their building, my role as an officer, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.206" offset="14624053">But no one would think I... I hope we would all agree... that the city bar would be liable just because I did something awful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3634.825" offset="14674522">They are members of the bar association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.372" offset="14680687">Maybe not the City Bar of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.996" offset="14687269">I turn to my third point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.386" offset="14696778">Mr. Schwarz is just wrong when he says that Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway is no longer good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.508" offset="14733245">As a matter of fact, the court of appeals panel in this case cited, albeit on a slightly different point, they cited a case which upholds Lake Shore, discusses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.659" offset="14777862">It is the United States versus the Ridgely Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.315" offset="14788520">Our own main brief and reply brief discuss other cases, including cases in the Second Circuit of very recent vintage, which recognize that 1892 decision by this Court is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.230" offset="14840138">Another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.683" offset="14849960">I turn to this argument which Mr. Shapiro made here this morning... the government brief I think also casts it up... suggesting that ASME and similarly situated voluntary member societies have enormous power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.286" offset="14916416">I think he uses the phrase "economic power", or whatever kind of coercive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.970" offset="14939090">Well, I don't want to say that ASME can go around recklessly avoiding its purposes and its duties to with whom it ever deals, but the fact is that the real power only comes to ASME's codes and standards when a government like Mr. Shapiro's and my federal government adopts those standards, or the states, or the provinces of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.820" offset="15038564">That is when the real coercive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.288" offset="15052357">And this is an interesting thing in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.568" offset="15061552">If you will notice in the record, the joint appendix... I think it appears at 79... of just what happened here, after Hydrolevel complained to ASME, after April of 1971, about this letter, which of course, as you know, very importantly never mentioned Hydrolevel at all, Hydrolevel complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.308" offset="15164474">There was a swift response, which again Mr. Schwarz tries to tell you never occurred and never does even now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.038" offset="15199374">It occurred right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.849" offset="15206584">On May 4 and 5 of 1972, in St. Paul, Minnesota, for two days, all kinds of people came in and on the docket was the complaint of Hydrolevel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.267" offset="15256321">Thereafter, contrary to what he insinuates even here today, the final June 9th, '72, letter was circularized to 300.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.388" offset="15292788">He tries to suggest it is less, but the record is clear, 300 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.511" offset="15309297">But finally, if you will notice who was shown in the record to be in those meetings, it is very important to the government point, there were government people present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.633" offset="15349735">You will see on 79 what are called conference members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.037" offset="15363423">These are men clearly identified, and women, who are officials of state governments, who were there listening, and the reason, of course, is, these were regulatory officials whose states had adopted some form or another of a code or standard put forth by ASME.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.544" offset="15445447">So, it is just not so that ASME has been recklessly and indifferently careening around the landscape of America--</text>
