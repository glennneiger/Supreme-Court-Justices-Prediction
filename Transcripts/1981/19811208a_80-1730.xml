            <label>Mr. Robert L. Morrison, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="74.214" offset="419511">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="78.250" offset="435602">The case before the Court today is another challenge of the pre-judgment seizure, somewhat on the order of the Fuentes case and its various progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.689" offset="473323">It bears a rather unusual past history which I would like to go into just a little bit because it bears on where we are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.830" offset="517940">Mr. Lugar, the petitioner, was the lessee/operator of Lakewood Truck Stop in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, down near the North Carolina border.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.685" offset="553362">He was its sole proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.935" offset="558377">Mr. Barbour is the President of Edmondson Oil Company who sold fuel to Mr. Lugar for resale, and Mr. Lugar had an open account with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.243" offset="599546">That was the only relationship between Edmondson Oil Company and Mr. Lugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.112" offset="615011">On the 31st of May, 1977, Mr. Barbour as President of Edmondson Oil Company swore out a pre-judgment attachment petition in the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County, which is the trial court of general jurisdiction in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.805" offset="673839">The petition in question alleged that Mr. Lugar was, I believe, assigning, concealing, disposing or converting his assets with the intent to hinder or delay his creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="710515">No fraud was alleged in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.612" offset="721068">This, as I said, was sworn out on the 31st of March, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.099" offset="746982">On the 1st of April, 1977, it was filed in the clerk's office of the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.186" offset="775298">The clerk, upon receipt of the petition for pre-judgment attachment, as mandated by the Code of Virginia, issued a writ of attachment to the Sheriff of Pittsylvania County directing him to levy on Mr. Lugar's goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.743" offset="821587">The sheriff did levy, as is shown in the Appendix, in his return on the 1st, the 2nd and the 4th of April on Mr. Lugar at Lakewood Truck Stop and also on his bank accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.916" offset="862234">At that point, his business assets were frozen, his bank accounts were frozen and he was prevented from doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.122" offset="895044">In Virginia, the pre-judgment attachment petition process is materially different from the detinue process.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.795" offset="925764">We have both.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.778" offset="929734">For a pre-judgment attachment petition you need only appear before the clerk with a sworn petition alleging that the defendant debtor is concealing, disposing, assigning or converting his assets with intent to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.022" offset="998697">Now, there are other grounds but they are not applicable here; they deal with out-of-state defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.743" offset="1017610">But you filed a suit either simultaneously or suit had been filed either simultaneously or before that, hadn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Morrison, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="230.397" offset="1044151">The petition for an attachment is the filing of the suit.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="234.516" offset="1060660">They are combined in one document?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_morrison" startTime="236.718" stopTime="282.497">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Morrison, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="236.718" offset="1069437">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.451" offset="1072363">If the attachment petition is dismissed... if the levy is dismissed, I should say, the action proceeds as a motion for judgment, which is the same thing as a complaint in Virginia by federal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.978" offset="1126488">So even though in this case the levy was dismissed, it went on as a motion for judgment and ended in a judgment against Mr. Lugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.131" offset="1155119">The writ issues by the clerk under the law as a ministerial act on the filing of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.403" offset="1192213">He issues a writ to the sheriff, no bond is required for the levy, although a bond for an actual physical seizure would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.807" offset="1221783">The sheriff goes and levies and really shuts them down, because the bank was not about to allow him the use of the money with a levy attached to it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="282.497" stopTime="285.115">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="282.497" offset="1252608">Do you say this is just like Fuents against Shevin, then?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_morrison" startTime="285.115" stopTime="304.176">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Morrison, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="285.115" offset="1263057">I would say it's very similar to Fuentes v. Shevin, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.484" offset="1276536">The difference that I would make between this and Fuents v. Shevin is that in Fuentes v. Shevin you had various items of personal property such as, I believe, a stove, seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.791" offset="1325751">In this case we had everything seized, or everything levied upon.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="304.176" stopTime="307.462">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="304.176" offset="1339334">So you think it's an even stronger case than Fuentes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_morrison" startTime="307.462" stopTime="468.134">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Morrison, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="307.462" offset="1352500">Yes, sir, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.730" offset="1357515">I think that this is also very easily comparable to the North Georgia Finishing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.134" offset="1383115">Then, when the sheriff levies, the defendant may then come in and file an affidavit of substantial defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.609" offset="1429091">When he files that, the creditor has ten days in which to post a bond to protect his levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.311" offset="1447899">The levy will be dismissed if the bond is not filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.696" offset="1457408">And in this case, a bond was filed after the affidavit of substantial defense was filed by Mr. Lugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.249" offset="1483635">The statute provides that when the petition is issued, there will be a return date on it, and in this case, the date of the hearing was set for one day after the return date; the return date was the 18th of April, the hearing date was set for the 19th, and a hearing was held on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.478" offset="1548523">No decision with respect to the levy was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.597" offset="1565032">A second hearing was held, I believe, on the 1st or the 4th of May, I am not sure which.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.501" offset="1580601">And on the 4th of May, 1977, a the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County finally dissolved the levy finding that no grounds whatsoever had been proven which would support the attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.673" offset="1625323">Then, after the state proceedings were concluded, Mr. Lugar filed a complaint in federal court seeking damages for deprivation of rights guaranteed under the Constitution under 42 U.S. Code Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.051" offset="1686763">The creditor filed a motion to abstain, alleging that a decision of the Virginia Supreme Court might eliminate the need for a decision on federal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.657" offset="1725215">That was the only thing that was contained in that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.359" offset="1736082">We briefed the issue of abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.394" offset="1748203">The district court turned around and ignored the abstention issue and dismissed on the authority of Flagg Brothers, describing the conduct in Flagg Brothers as more flagrant than the conduct in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.249" offset="1787595">Lugar sought to amend the judgment or to have it modified, was unsuccessful in doing so on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.670" offset="1813300">In the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the parties addressed the issue of whether or not the reliance on Flagg Brothers was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.759" offset="1841617">The court of appeals decided that the district court's reliance on Flagg Brothers was not appropriate, but affirmed dismissal on a different ground that was, again, not addressed by the parties, there being a requirement in suits of this sort for a... either an allegation or a finding of a direct conspiracy, a corruption, if you will, of state power between the private party and the state officials, or, in the alternative as I understand their opinion, such an abdication of control over state power is to make the state merely agents or the state just gives the power to the creditor.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="468.134" offset="1995112">Well, this goes to a fairly fundamental point, doesn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="472.503" offset="2012666">Is there a difference between the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition which is addressed only to states, and the language under color of state law in 1983?</text>
            <text syncTime="491.917" offset="2090302">Do those mean the same thing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_morrison" startTime="493.217" stopTime="557.442">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Morrison, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="493.217" offset="2095422">I believe they do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.036" offset="2106707">But I believe that this Court has put a gloss on the meaning of under color of state law to include actions by private parties which are joint and with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.741" offset="2145577">And in this situation here, the state acts as an agent of the private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.728" offset="2161564">The point that I have made in the court of appeals and that I tried to make to the district court was that in the situation that we have here where there is no pre-attachment property interest whatsoever in the property that is going to be seized, that the creditor has no self-help remedy whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.411" offset="2260203">If he was to act for a self-help remedy, he would be liable for criminal penalties and we wouldn't be here today if that's what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.599" offset="2289042">But instead, what happens is the state, so to speak, on a silver platter says here, you may use us to take sides in your dispute with your defendant debtor initially; we're going to seize his property for you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.642" offset="6077215">When the initial complaint under Section 1983 was filed in the district court, the respondents filed a motion to abstain on the theory that the complaint had to be, in effect, to be a 1983 action it had to be some sort of challenge to the constitutionality of the Virginia attachment statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.324" offset="6175853">The respondents, in filing the motion to abstain, requested the district court to abstain so that this issue could be properly determined by the Supreme Court of Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.908" offset="6278253">On page 5 of the district court record, he specifically wrote the district court in memorandum... this is cited in our brief... saying there's no question of the constitutionality of the statute being in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.566" offset="6332902">Now, as the court of appeals pointed out, this ambivalence, this lack of any sort of clear challenge to the constitutionality of the statute persisted in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.559" offset="6388804">On page 53 of the Petition for Write of Ceriorari, which contains the opinion of the court of appeals, it's obvious that the decision of the Fourth Circuit is premised in part on the presumptive, valid state judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.905" offset="6474172">The opinion of the Fourt Circuit, taking the narrow issue as presented to the district court and, of course, to the court of appeals, is that the attachment statutes of the state of Virginia are constitutionally sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.644" offset="7525130">Justice Blackmun, our position is... and I think the position of the court of appeals is, following up Justice Stevens' question... that state action and acting under color of law are not the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.386" offset="7588137">If state action is all that was involved, certainly the state of Virginia in this case, through the actions of the clerk and through the actions of the sheriff who issued the attachment and levied the attachment, certainly there was state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.082" offset="7650936">Now, the question is where the state judicial proceedings are presumptively valid, as in this case, as the court of appeals stated, where there is no even insinuation that the clerk and the sheriff did anything wrong, anything out of the ordinary, in fact the petitioner clearly states that they acted only according to law... he states that in the statement of facts to the brief on the merits in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.486" offset="7788549">The question then, as the court of appeals formulated it, is granted there's state action: but for purposes of a 1983 action, is that action under color of state law to sustain a complaint filed under the 1983 section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.717" offset="7869424">And of course, the court, of appeals, and I think properly so, held that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.935" offset="7886351">Now, Justice Blackmun, I don't agree... or I think probably the language of the court of appeals may be too severe to say that in a 1983 action, the plaintiff has got to show corruption of the state official in such a manner that it, in effect, reduces the state's power to a joint concert and joint action between the private defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.873" offset="8118110">"As will appear, it has not been necessary in our disposition of the appeal to address the question of whether the property seizure was constitutionally invalid on either ground. "</text>
