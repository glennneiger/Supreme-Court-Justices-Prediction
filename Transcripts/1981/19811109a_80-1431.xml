            <text syncTime="9.700" offset="165742">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether a state may adopt rules relating to legal advertising when the necessary effect is to inhibit advertising which is truthful, effectual, not misleading, and beneficial to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.846" offset="422264">Well, Mr. Blackmar, as to the particular facts of this case, supposing we were to conclude that under Bates the rules adopted by the Supreme Court of Missouri were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.974" offset="522783">Would we be free to roam at large beyond this particular rule and say that A, B, C, D are permitted, but E, F, G are not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles B. Blackmar</label>
            <text syncTime="118.514" offset="600942">I plead a particular case for a particular client, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.059" offset="623198">I would say that the decision should respond to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.026" offset="647022">I would say, though, that this form of rulemaking in which the Supreme Court of Missouri says, this you may say and nothing else, would be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.537" offset="701043">I am not here to argue about what rules the Supreme Court of Missouri might adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.283" offset="728106">Bates specified quite a few suggestions, such as arguing about the quality of legal services and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.435" offset="772618">The Supreme Court of Missouri did not follow those suggestions.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.621" offset="789441">It adopted a rule listing ten permissible categories of information, and saying this is all that a lawyer may advertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.226" offset="827789">I want you to hold that rule invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.069" offset="843149">What other rules they might adopt, that is not my problem at this stage.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="183.613" offset="861330">To reverse the judgment, we wouldn't even have to hold that rule invalid, would we?</text>
            <text syncTime="192.110" offset="895394">All we would have to say is that your client should not have been privately reprimanded for advertising as he did because his advertisement was permitted under the Constitution.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_b_blackmar" startTime="210.415" stopTime="286.104">
            <label>Mr. Charles B. Blackmar</label>
            <text syncTime="210.415" offset="968537">You would have to say that, but I believe you would necessarily have to say that the rule that says that this you may say and nothing else is invalid, because that rule would necessarily inhibit protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.861" offset="1030395">Now, the balance of the Missouri rule, the A part of the rule, which talks about advertising that is misleading, self-laudatory, and so forth, you wouldn't have to touch.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.530" offset="1061010">That is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.936" offset="1062682">That is not charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.577" offset="1065190">Of course, there is another part of this case, Your Honor, Your Honors, that the Missouri rule completely denies the mail as a medium of legal advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.508" offset="1140945">We argue very strongly that the same advertisement that could be published in the newspaper could be sent in the mail, and so that is another part of the case which supports the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.672" offset="1213565">It is not discussed in the least in the opinion of the court, but nevertheless, it certainly is present in the case, because it consists of one of the four charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.104" offset="1271348">Now, every member of the bar, in order to practice in the state, must be a member of this association, Is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles B. Blackmar</label>
            <text syncTime="294.038" offset="1303113">Yes, it is an integrated bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.178" offset="1307606">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.522" offset="1313040">Your annual license fee makes one a member of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.066" offset="1335192">But now, I might say there is much misunderstanding on this, that the disciplinary proceedings are something that the Missouri bar has nothing to do with.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.577" offset="1377196">Those have been totally pre-empted by the Supreme Court of Missouri, and by a constituent body called the advisory committee of the Missouri bar.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="324.557" offset="1425157">You mean they are the enforcement arm?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles B. Blackmar</label>
            <text syncTime="325.432" offset="1428605">They are the enforcement arm of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.930" offset="1438636">I think that is important, because they are selected by the Supreme Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="332.632" stopTime="336.412">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="332.632" offset="1457445">Are they not in effect the enforcement arm of the integrated bar, too?</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_b_blackmar" startTime="336.412" stopTime="407.055">
            <label>Mr. Charles B. Blackmar</label>
            <text syncTime="336.412" offset="1472596">I would say that the enforcement proceeding is entirely in the hands of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.502" offset="1492971">The integrated bar has no authority in these premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.360" offset="1516377">The confusion of terms, I submit, is the responsibility of the court, which has created these two bodies which have Missouri bar in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.684" offset="1553680">Disciplinary proceedings are the province of the court entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.636" offset="1573428">I think the greatest vice in the rule under consideration is that it does something that is unprecedented in First Amendment experience, and that is to have a system in which the regulatory authorities specify the manner of speech, rather than leaving it to the speaker to select his or her own form of expression, subject to proper rules that might be drafted, and subject to the rules which the Supreme Court of Missouri has but which are not involved in this case, which prevent the freedom of speech.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="407.055" stopTime="409.803">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="407.055" offset="1755136">Now, this, I gather, is the prior restraint argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_b_blackmar" startTime="409.803" stopTime="459.657">
            <label>Mr. Charles B. Blackmar</label>
            <text syncTime="409.803" offset="1766107">I think it would be a prior restraint argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.896" offset="1782512">It says, this you may say and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.285" offset="1792021">Now, it is a rule of general application, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.830" offset="1810202">There is no provision for applying to the advisory committee or to the court for permission to advertise in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.121" offset="1867358">The Appellant, the lawyer tried that.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.636" offset="1873418">He sent this ad to the advisory committee, and was curtly told that it does not comply with the rules because it has unauthorized matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.553" offset="1917095">So, I think that there is no question at all that this is a prior restraint in that it absolutely forbids certain forms of expression.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="459.657" stopTime="469.561">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="459.657" offset="1965578">The rule prohibiting self-laudatory advertising would likewise be a prior restraint then, wouldn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_b_blackmar" startTime="469.561" stopTime="485.913">
            <label>Mr. Charles B. Blackmar</label>
            <text syncTime="469.561" offset="2005180">It would be present, in that it does not pass in advance on what the speaker says.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.354" offset="2040289">In other words, he takes a chance that something that he might say might be found to be a violation of the self-laudatory rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.383" offset="2064426">By the way, that is not charged in this case, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="485.913" stopTime="489.474">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="485.913" offset="2070591">But the two, both of them would be prior restraints.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_b_blackmar" startTime="489.474" stopTime="549.637">
            <label>Mr. Charles B. Blackmar</label>
            <text syncTime="489.474" offset="2084801">Well, I am thinking of the prior restraint as something that says that unless you can fit something into these particular categories, you may not say it, and I think that would be different from the self-laudatory ad, which seeks to provide an external standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.812" offset="2150212">By the way, I am not here to talk about the validity or invalidity of prohibition on self-laudatory statements, but I think that that sets an external standard that the speaker has to conform to.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.775" offset="2209980">It doesn't really... it doesn't really prohibit the speaker from using his or her own language.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.194" offset="2231714">It simply says that if you transgress this line, you nay be subject to censure.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.910" offset="2250522">Now, the rule before us says that if you say anything such as this appellant said, he was licensed to practice in Missouri and Illinois, and they say you can't say that, or if he said he was licensed to practice in the federal court, that is not one of the things that is listed, so it can't be said.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="549.637" offset="2325441">Would it be appropriate in your view for a lawyer who practiced personal injury law to say that my average verdicts over the past 12 months have been $129,000, assuming that is a fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="566.287" offset="2392106">I would note foreclose the right of the state to regulate something like that, because I think the state might well feel that it was misleading, Your Honor, and it didn't talk about the case, it might present an odious comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.297" offset="2456158">Yes, I would think, and we have said, that if the state would adopt a rule that said, in effect, that one may not advertise the results of his litigation, the size of his verdicts, or the number of acquittals, or something like that, I would not foreclose that kind of rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.492" offset="2524912">That is not this case, and so I am not going to argue about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.442" offset="2548736">Now, until they have some valid regulation like that, I would say that Your Honors' Central Hudson opinion would stand in the way of doing that under a rule that is not narrowly drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.901" offset="2958545">It would be weaker, but what the Court has said, though, is that specifically legal advertising, which is truthful and not misleading, is protected speech which may be regulated only by narrowly drawn rules directed to the purpose, and I think that that really is sufficient to dispose of both parts of this case, which involve an absolute prohibition against a printed ad containing something that is not specifically prohibited, and an absolute prohibition on the use of the mails as a medium of legal advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.015" offset="6226986">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the discussion that has been going on most recently in this presentation by Mr. Blackmar I think really gets at the heart of the issue, which I believe the Court was trying to cover in the Bates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.162" offset="6327609">I think in the Bates case that what the Court was saying was, we believe there should be more information flowing freely and cleanly to the public so as to enable the public to have a more intelligent way of making a decision in the selection of a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.169" offset="6403574">Incident to that, of course, was this lawyer's First Amendment right to speak, which is, of course, present in any commercial speech case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.369" offset="6448400">I think what the Court has to do is weigh these rights and these objectives in the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.192" offset="6491658">We have seen that following Bates, a number of courts have arrived at entirely opposite conclusions as to what is necessary in order to achieve this balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.077" offset="6551218">That is, to enable the lawyer to speak freely, so that the public will be more informed, which it must be, and with which we concur, and at the same time protect the public from potentially misleading or deceptive statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.555" offset="6621121">The statement with regard to the courts in which the lawyer is admitted, I think, is potentially misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.175" offset="6659574">I think that information is of value to other lawyers, and it is published in professional publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.405" offset="6704504">I think it is necessary for referral work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.248" offset="12375897">I don't think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.231" offset="12383838">I don't think it is well understood, but I don't really think that is dispositive of the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.872" offset="12390421">A great many states, following Plan A of the American bar, now permit listing of areas of practice, and some of them say you may use three or five or all, whatever it is, and those... the nomenclature differs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.927" offset="12474640">Now, are we to say, or is this Court going to take them one by one and say, well, we don't think that that is a proper term to use, there is a better one?</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.764" offset="12530019">There is no question but that the Appellant's right to speak freely has been infringed upon, but this is not a right that is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.041" offset="12583100">This is commercial speech, and I think the state has a right reasonably to infringe upon his right to speak freely as long as it does not do it unreasonably, and as long as it is in the furtherance of the state interest, which concededly exists, and in the language of Central Hudson does not go any farther than it needs to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.156" offset="12687590">I think what the Court needs to do is look at the Missouri rule and apply the Central Hudson test, which is now the rule, and say, does it go beyond what is necessary in order to protect the public's interest in not being misled or deceived by legal advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.724" offset="12761778">With regard to the other questions concerning if a lawyer has violated... is accused of violating two or more rules, and then this Court finds that he is guilty of violating one but not the other, then, of course, it would still require affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.357" offset="12848400">I would hope that the Court would, in applying the Central Hudson test, find that Missouri rules do not go beyond that which is necessary to protect the state's interest and affirm the decision of the Missouri court.</text>
