            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="9.675" offset="116100">This case presents the issue whether an insured serviceman's beneficiary designated under a life policy issued pursuant to the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 prevails over a constructive trust imposed upon the policy proceeds by a state-court decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.147" offset="214007">It is another in a line of recent cases that concerns the impact of state law or state judgments upon statutorily created federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.484" offset="255281">This is a dispute over the proceeds of a serviceman's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.660" offset="271999">On the one side of the serviceman's first wife and their children and on the other, his second wife, who was his widow at his death. Each claimed the policy proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.506" offset="323408">The former's claim rested on a divorce decree of a Maine court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.093" offset="341798">And the widow's claim rested on the beneficiary designation and her status as widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.257" offset="366458">The trial court felt that the imposition of a constructive trust on the policy proceeds would interfere with the operation of a federal Act and would run afoul of the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.965" offset="413269">The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine ruled otherwise and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.869" offset="432913">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we in turn reversed the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.667" offset="464051">We hold that the insured's beneficiary designation prevails over the constructive trust imposed upon the policy proceeds by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.422" offset="507101">As a consequence of the Supremacy Clause, a state divorce decree, like other law governing the economic aspects of domestic relations, must give way to clearly conflicting federal enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.148" offset="561958">The provision of the Act according the insured service members certain rights prevail over and displace inconsistent state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.890" offset="600933">The imposition of a constructive trust on the insurance proceed is also inconsistent with the anti-attachment provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.435" offset="635101">A result of this kind, of course, may be avoided if Congress chooses to avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.344" offset="654745">It is within the power of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.974" offset="665299">But thus far, Congress has insulated the proceeds of this insurance from attachment or seizure by any claimant other than the beneficiary designated by the insured or the one first in line under the statutory order of precedence of beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.565" offset="735620">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined in that opinion by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.191" offset="766131">Mr. Justice Stevens has also filed a dissent and Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
