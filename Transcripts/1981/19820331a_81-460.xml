            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="134241">Ms. Burgess, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary Ann Burgess</label>
            <text syncTime="39.703" offset="292961">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="43.452" offset="308008">The present case involves a strong public policy consistently fostered by this Court against interference with state proceedings by federal courts either by way of injunction or declaratory remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.415" offset="363805">The court below declined to follow this policy and interfered in an ongoing state bar disciplinary process, thereby inserting itself into the delicate relationship between a state judiciary and attorney's license to practice before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.847" offset="433604">The case therefore provides this Court with an opportunity to consider the application of the policy of noninterference articulated in Younger and amplified by its progeny to attorney disciplinary proceedings, and to firmly establish the appropriateness of federal noninterference to such proceedings which involve such significant and important state concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.334" offset="543528">It must be underscored that what this case does not involve is the constitutionality of particular disciplinary rules or whether an attorney violated those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.830" offset="589503">What is at stake is whether the State Supreme Court can articulate and develop standards governing attorney discipline and discipline attorneys who have been charged with violating those standards free and unfettered from federal intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.167" offset="658884">However, in order to fully appreciate the issues that this raises it is necessary to briefly discuss the factual setting in which it arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.381" offset="703710">The case has its origin in the criminal trial of Joanne Chesimard who was charged with the murder of a New Jersey state trooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.299" offset="747387">During the jury selection process in this trial Lennox Hinds, an attorney in New Jersey, called a press conference concerning the conduct of that trial, and more particular, that of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.402" offset="803812">Reports of the press conference--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="169.838" offset="813529">Had there been any advance... had there been any advance indication from the judge directing all counsel not to have any public statements?</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary Ann Burgess</label>
            <text syncTime="177.945" offset="845921">--It is my understanding, Chief Justice, that there was an order of some type directed to the counsel in the case, and I believe that during the press conference Mr. Hinds indicated that he was speaking on behalf of the counsel in the case because they had been gagged by the trial court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.811" offset="925438">That was report in the news article which appeared in the New York Daily News and the Newark Star Ledger.</text>

          <turn speaker="mary_ann_burgess" startTime="210.338" stopTime="323.978">
            <label>Ms. Mary Ann Burgess</label>
            <text syncTime="210.338" offset="975593">--He was not of counsel in that particular trial, yes, Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.102" offset="994610">It was reported in these articles that Mr. Hinds had called the proceeding a travesty, had indicated that Judge Appleby, the trial judge, was without judicial temperament or racial sensitivity to sit as an objective judge in this particular trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.080" offset="1058558">It was reported that he called the... that he accused the judge of asking self-serving questions which was leading to the creation of a hangman's court.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.824" offset="1109444">David Foley, a member of the Middlesex County Ethics Committee, brought these articles to the attention of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.679" offset="1144866">He was authorized to investigate the matter and determine whether there were any possible infractions of the New Jersey disciplinary rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.193" offset="1174959">He communicated by letter with Mr. Hinds and asked for an opportunity to meet with him and discuss the reports that had been circulated, had been reported in the papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.390" offset="1227727">Mr. Hinds declined to meet with Mr. Foley, and although the attorney disciplinary process is a private, confidential process, he disclosed that initial communication at a press conference, and it was widely publicized in the papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.039" offset="1298362">In order to protect the jury trial that was still in process the committee determined not to proceed with the investigation until the trial itself had been concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.223" offset="1343083">When it was concluded, the investigation was reactivated and Mr. Foley again attempted to meet with Mr. Hinds to discuss the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.860" offset="1373594">After several unsuccessful attempts, the investigation went on without Mr. Hinds' cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.373" offset="1399717">When it was concluded, Mr. Foley recommended that a statement of charges be filed against Mr. Hinds.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="323.978" stopTime="329.071">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="323.978" offset="1430123">Ms. Burgess, I wonder if you'd try to speak just a little louder, would you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_ann_burgess" startTime="329.071" stopTime="566.944">
            <label>Ms. Mary Ann Burgess</label>
            <text syncTime="329.071" offset="1450499">Certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.055" offset="1454365">Indicating that he had been... had violated Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(5) in that the statements were prejudicial to the administration of justice; and secondly, that these statements violated DR 7-107(D) in that they were made during the jury selection process and were reasonably likely to interfere with a fair trial in that they were intended to influence the taking of prospective jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.513" offset="1568259">The latter disciplinary rule had been adopted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey following the decision of this Court in Shepherd v. Maxwell wherein the Court urged all state courts to adopt rules designed to protect the criminal trial process from prejudicial outside interferences in order to assure a fair trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.535" offset="1660314">In accordance with the recommendations of Mr. Foley the committee did in fact issue a statement of charges against Lennox Hinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.406" offset="1695841">However, instead of answering those charges, Mr. Hinds initiated... Mr. Hinds, together with three organizations of minority attorneys, initiated a complaint in federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.385" offset="1743697">In that action they sought to enjoin the ethics... the processing of the ethics complaint and also to obtain a declaratory judgment that the disciplinary rules under which he was charged were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.848" offset="1801585">Significantly, the complaint never alleged that Mr. Hinds could not adjudicate these constitutional claims within the context of the New Jersey attorney disciplinary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.173" offset="1842858">Rather, it suggests... actually it states that these... both the Ethics Committee and the Supreme Court were somehow biased and that they could not objectively review the constitutionality of the rules that had been adopted by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.744" offset="1909209">The district court dismissed the complaint under Younger abstention, concluding that principles of comity and federalism dictate that the federal court abstain so that the state court could consider the constitutionality of its disciplinary rules free from federal intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.596" offset="1984546">It therefore rejected the claims that both the Ethics Committee and the Supreme Court were somehow biased tribunals to determine the constitutionality of their own regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.466" offset="2024043">Plaintiffs moved to amend for the limited purpose of permitting the plaintiffs to... the opportunity to demonstrate either the bad faith or harassment which would operate as an exception to the Younger abstention doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.352" offset="2079632">There was extensive discovery and two days of hearings before the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.553" offset="2100425">A supplemental opinion... in a supplemental opinion the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had totally failed to meet their burden of demonstrating either the bad faith or harassment which would operate as an exception to Younger abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.093" offset="2158522">The plaintiffs appealed and moved for a stay before the trial court, which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.294" offset="2179315">So, in fact, the processing of the disciplinary matter before the Ethics Committee was stayed in April of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.339" offset="2207528">In its decision below, the Third Circuit concluded that the district court had abused its discretion when it dismissed on Younger absention grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.866" offset="2253608">This decision represents a radical departure from the well-established tradition of federal noninterference in pending state attorney disciplinary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.282" offset="2299270">The Third Circuit posits a very novel basis for justifying federal intrusion into the delicate and unique relationship between the Supreme Court and attorneys' license to practice before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.668" offset="2352873">The court initially fragmented the Ethics Committee segment of a unitary disciplinary process or the remainder of that process.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.415" offset="2527893">There are three areas in which they can make final determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.290" offset="2543358">If they find that there is no indication of unethical conduct they can dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.303" offset="2563420">They can do that either before the investigation when they got the initial complaint or after the hearing they determine there is no unethical conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.033" offset="2598319">So in two instances they can dismiss.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.733" offset="4817160">There has been a history in our court of a very flexible procedure with regard to attorney disciplinary matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.904" offset="4977761">It's interlocutory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.036" offset="6942378">In other words, there was a mechanism in our structure whereby at this particular stage the body holds hearings.</text>
