            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="102.631" offset="572116">Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court, this is something of an historic occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.643" offset="608165">Never before have the two Houses of Congress been forced to intervene as litigating parties before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.919" offset="661350">They have been forced to intervene to protest another episode in the... what this Court once described as the tug of war between the executive and the legislative branches of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.050" offset="761869">The House of Representatives, which I represent here, views this attack upon the legislative powers of Congress as directed primarily at the historic, necessary, and proper power of the Congress to enact legislation which it deems appropriate and necessary in execution of its vested legislative powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.487" offset="911603">I suggest that that is the proper place for starting the constitutional analysis of the validity of Section 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.698" offset="988403">But before we get to that analysis, we must understand that, as I stated before, while the assault here comes upon that particular provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act, this is but one episode in the far-flung, orchestrated war declared by the executive branch against the device that is popularly and often inaccurately known as the legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.506" offset="1187665">In case after case where private parties seek to raise this constitutional attack upon the so-called legislative veto, the executive branch immediately drops all opposition and concedes that the veto provision is indeed unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.323" offset="1302918">That has forced the two Houses of Congress to become litigating parties, which is not their basic function, but we have been forced by the fact that there is no one in the executive department that sees fit to defend or state the case for the constitutionality of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.387" offset="1427156">Now, that very fact, as in this case, gives rise to a tremendous number of severe problems, threshold problems about whether or not that is a case or controversy, or whether there are other reasons why such a momentous constitutional question should be addressed under the circumstances in which this case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.950" offset="1585458">We have in this case alone critical problems about the jurisdiction of the lower court to consider this constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.102" offset="1634046">We have problems of justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.507" offset="1647629">We have problems about the standing of Mr. Chadha to institute this kind of constitutional challenge based not on his personal claims or rights but upon the executive's claims with respect to the legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.077" offset="1717951">We have a severe problem with respect to the lack of any adverse parties in the court below, and there are other prudential considerations, to say nothing of a critical severability problem which may preclude resolving the constitutional question, a matter which my colleague, the Senate legal counsel, will address.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.972" offset="1833517">To take but one brief look at the technical appeal problem that is before this Court in Number 80-1832, where the government has sought to take an appeal to this Court under Section 1252 as a non-aggrieved party.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.990" offset="1957546">I will not add anything to what has been said in our written briefs on this subject, except to call attention to the Court's procuring of a ruling one month ago, on January 11th, in Donovan against Richmond County Association, which I suggest makes even more severe the government's problem in trying to take an appeal to this Court under Section 1252.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.098" offset="2125984">But to get back to the other issues in this case, I suggest that the key to understanding all these threshold problems as well as the basic constitutional question, lies in an appreciation of the actual meaning and scope of the statutory scheme issue, to wit, Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.688" offset="2316364">Now, the executive and Mr. Chadha would begin and end their constitutional analysis by referring to the two constitutional objections that are repeated over and over again in all this litigation respecting the so-called legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.753" offset="2452619">That is an objection based upon the presentment clause, Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution, which typifies the bicameral method of legislating, subject to presentment to the President for his approval or veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.664" offset="2548331">The other claim, the only other constitutional objection raised, again by Mr. Chadha as well as by the executive, is that this provision somehow violates the general separation of powers doctrine, not that it violates any function vested expressly in the President or the judiciary, but that it violates simply Baron de Montesquieu's original theory of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.524" offset="2695767">It seems to me, however, that that is turning constitutional analysis upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.537" offset="2735786">We must begin analysis where this Court has always begun to evaluate Congressional legislation, and that is, let's see what Congress was actually doing, what power was it trying to execute when it adopted this provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.120" offset="2842157">Basically, I rely upon the analysis that was established by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch versus Maryland in 1819, and has been followed literally hundreds of times by this Court in evaluating the constitutionality of Congressional legislation, where Congress is trying to exercise some of its given power.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.576" offset="2971933">It is not difficult to state that standard that Marshall laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.459" offset="3019476">In the first part, he says, let the end be legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.443" offset="3039433">Let it be within the constitutional scope of Congressional powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.581" offset="3075900">Secondly, he said that all means which Congress considers appropriate to a legitimate end are constitutional, and this Court has said many times that that simply means that there must be a rational connection between the means and the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.290" offset="3166807">And thirdly, the McCulloch opinion says that the means selected by the Congress in exercise of its vast discretion under this necessary and proper clause must be consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.344" offset="3251025">Now, he also added another part to that last step.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.559" offset="3287910">In order for any other provision in the Constitution to inhibit or restrict the means selected by the Congress, he says, at Page 408 of the McCulloch opinion, that those other words of the Constitution must imperiously require a restriction upon the means.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="815.794" stopTime="830.976">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="815.794" offset="3424792">Well, Mr. Gressman, do you think that cases like United States against Myers involving the firing of a postmaster, and Buckley against Valeo, involving the method of appointment to the Federal Election Commission, violate McCulloch against Maryland?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="830.976" stopTime="897.495">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="830.976" offset="3485500">Not at all, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.101" offset="3489993">It seems to me that the appointments clause in Article II, I think it is, imperiously inhibits any means selected by Congress whereby Congress is trying to appoint an officer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.217" offset="3574526">So it is entirely consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.732" offset="3584557">I am not objecting to the use of the separation of powers doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.714" offset="3604514">I am merely saying that somehow, if that is the objection, the doctrine must be reduced to a specific imperious restriction, as it is when you have some vested Presidential power that is specified in Article II, where Congress seeks to invade or utilize.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.265" offset="3722692">I think that is a clear imperious restriction upon Congressional power.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="897.495" stopTime="900.979">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="897.495" offset="3751636">Does United States against Lovett have something to do with this, too?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="900.979" stopTime="913.630">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="900.979" offset="3765533">No, I don't believe the Lovett case had anything to do with the power of Congress vis-a-vis the executive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="913.630" stopTime="927.999">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="913.630" offset="3816106">Well, wasn't that an effort, at least so Justice Black's opinion reached a conclusion that Congress was undertaking to terminate the employment of an executive branch officer without any due process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="927.999" stopTime="968.592">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="927.999" offset="3873576">Yes, without any due process, and it was considered to be a bill of attainder, which was a right adhering to the private parties in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.713" offset="3920491">That was... the Congress was not there attempting to execute some kind of power that was vested in the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.069" offset="3961869">It was simply that Congress violated the bill of attainder clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.205" offset="3990500">Now, I say that that is another good example of a provision in the Constitution which might imperiously restrict the means selected in a given case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="968.592" stopTime="974.792">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="968.592" offset="4035953">I take it you think the bill of attainder is the only basis on which that result is supportable in the Lovett case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="974.792" stopTime="1163.434">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="974.792" offset="4060821">Well, as I read the majority opinion and the briefs in that case, that was the main and the only issue that became decisive in this Court's opinion, and it was not conceived of as an executive-legislative conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.224" offset="4126545">Now, to quickly address the McCulloch analysis to the provisions in Section 244, I think it is without any doubt that the end being sought in this legislation was within the legitimate powers of the Congress under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.881" offset="4265203">The Immigration and Nationality Act and Section 244 thereof are directed toward the Congressional control over aliens and deportation, and as this Court said as late as 1977 in Fiallo versus Bell, in 430 U. S., this Court has repeatedly emphasized that over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.725" offset="4412534">Our cases have long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the government's political departments, largely immune from judicial control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.141" offset="4474183">So, the end sought here, that is, the control over aliens, is certainly a legitimate end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.935" offset="4505321">Secondly, let us look at the means selected by the Congress to achieve that kind of control or end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.897" offset="4569164">Was it appropriate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.834" offset="4580971">Well, we have attempted time and again in our briefs to outline the meaning and the significance of Section 244.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.454" offset="4631440">Any way you look at it, it is by intention and by language a procedure for petitioning the Congress of the United States to be excused from compliance with a lawful deportation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.460" offset="4711479">It replaces the private bill technique for attaining identical kind of relief through private bill legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.956" offset="4757455">Section 244 also delegates to the Attorney General certain limited functions in the consideration of those petitions or applications.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1163.434" offset="4815342">Mr. Gressman, may I ask you, you rely on the power to pass private naturalization bills, I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.447" offset="4843450">Are those bills consistent with the constitutional requirement that naturalization bills must be uniform?</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.364" offset="4887127">Well, I am not sure that those are the types of legislation, private legislation I am referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.050" offset="4917847">These are simply ones that permit by private bill an alien to stay within this country, not to be naturalized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.548" offset="6935858">The impasse had resulted from the inability of those two branches to reconcile the desire of the executive for discretionary authority to waive mandatory deportation laws, and the prevalent belief in the Congress that to grant such discretion would be to advocate its responsibility over the Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.833" offset="7037004">In 1940, the Congress and the executive resolved their stalemate by agreeing to a compromise, since amended into Section 244, by which they have since cooperated in granting permanent residence to thousands of deportable aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.389" offset="7107221">The executive now asserts that there was a fundamental constitutional defect in that accommodation, and that this Court should now revise the legislative bargain to give to the executive the very power which the Congress had refused to grant to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.388" offset="7431140">The Congress was exact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.387" offset="7439185">The laws were precise, and there was no relief from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.464" offset="7455486">The executive came to the Congress and said, in the interest of humanity, there should be a procedure for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.931" offset="7481399">But year after year, the Congress refused to grant that until they fashioned this accommodation whereby both branches would participate in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.894" offset="7525180">Two principal questions are presented by the executive's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.252" offset="7542630">The first is whether the Court may sever and refashion the statute to grant to the executive the precise statutory power which the Congress had refused to delegate to that branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.824" offset="7596965">Second is whether the doctrine of separation of powers requires the Court to deny to the two political branches that means of compromise and accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.851" offset="7645030">Severability is a statutory question, but in this case it is also an important question of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.738" offset="7680557">The court of appeals concluded that the introductory subsection to 244 could be severed from the remainder of the section, and stand as an independent grant of final authority to the executive, but Respondents do not defend that precise holding in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.105" offset="7762059">The central feature of the compromise of 1940 was participation by the Congress in the granting of permanent residence to deportable aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.803" offset="7804795">The text of the statute confirms this, because the Attorney General may only cancel a deportation if neither house disapproves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.564" offset="7847845">This is why Respondents urge this Court to ask a very different question than has ever been put to the Court on the question of severability, and that is, what would Congress have done if it had known that this Court years later would find unconstitutional a procedure chosen by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.289" offset="7934780">The degree to which the Respondents' test would ask the Court to become involved in the legislative process is illustrated by the history of Section 244.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.833" offset="7984936">The Congress chose and adhered to the basic design of this section in the course of rejecting a variety of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.813" offset="8024851">Even if the Court thought that it was within its power to make a second choice for the Congress, it would be difficult to know which second choice to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.495" offset="8071558">Among the diverse second choices rejected by the Congress have been the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.618" offset="8092142">In 1937, Representative Diaz proposed that the executive be granted this final authority, but for only a limited number of aliens, for a limited number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.409" offset="8147313">The second possibility was the House bill in 1939, which might very well have become the law but for the Senate compromise, and that was to give the executive the power to suspend deportations temporarily, and ask the Congress for legislation to cancel those deportations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.152" offset="8226202">A third was President Eisenhower's proposals in 1956 and 1957 to give to the Attorney General this final authority but for only certain classes of aliens, such as clergymen and veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.504" offset="8287642">And a fourth was what the Congress was fully prepared to do prior to the 1940 Act, and that was to do nothing except expect compliance with mandatory deportation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.108" offset="8342082">There is no judicial standing by which the Court may now determine what alternative choice to make for the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.915" offset="8857321">I think this brings the Court to the second question, and it is one that is briefed by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.489" offset="8899535">If it is impossible to sever this statute without being unfaithful to the intent of the Congress, that the judgment of the Attorney General is only a preliminary judgment, and that legal effect may only be given with the approval of the Congress, then the Court must decide, is there any basis upon which it can give relief to the alien respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.837" offset="9013011">If the statute is inseverable, then the entire system for discretionary relief falls, and the issue goes back to the Congress to decide whether it should be replaced at all, but if that is the case, then there is no benefit that the particular individual who brought this proceeding has to gain from the Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.375" offset="9099110">The Respondents argue nonetheless that the Court should proceed to decide the issue, that the Court has never decided a case in which there is no benefit to be conferred either immediately or potentially on the individual who invokes the Court's jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.584" offset="12763985">Any attempt to explain a legislative veto in such a way as to blunt the separation of powers problems, that this is not really enforcement of the law, or this is not really interpretation of the law, only serves to highlight the fact that whatever else may be involved, the Congress is clearly exercising legislative power, making new law, and is doing so by one House of Congress and without participation by the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="4948.014" offset="19953719">In this case, Mr. Chadha succeeded in persuading the Immigration and Naturalization Service that deportation would result in extreme hardship, but that was not enough, for a year and a half later the House of Representatives meted out what the court of appeals aptly described as a summary reversal, and told Mr. Chadha and five other aliens out of 340 that they may not remain in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.752" offset="20072629">As a result, the Immigration Service had no choice but to order his deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.406" offset="20091228">Despite this clear causal connection, both the House and the Senate insist that Mr. Chadha has no place being in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.028" offset="20125709">They say he lacks standing, that there is no adverseness, it's a political question, and that he's even in the wrong court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.649" offset="20152250">Indeed, according to the Congress, one of the principal reasons why he is barred from the courthouse door is that the Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer in this country, has concluded that the veto here is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.925" offset="20209301">The court of appeals fully considered and rejected each of these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.172" offset="20230304">Our brief has replied to them also.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.626" offset="20240126">I only want to discuss the one today upon which the Congress seems to place principal reliance, and that is the issue of severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.544" offset="20271786">The Congress has said that the veto is inseparable from the rest of the statute, that the veto was at the core of scheme, and that if the veto is invalid, then Mr. Chadha is not entitled to relief, therefore the hardship scheme must fall in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.522" offset="20331763">Now, in answering this question of severability, it is vital to focus on the proper inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.784" offset="20360811">This Court held in both Buckley against Valeo and the Champlin Refining Company that an unconstitutional provision is severable... and these are the Court's words...</text>

            <text syncTime="5068.636" offset="20436149">Thus, under this Court's test, the burden of proof lies with the party seeking to deny severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.570" offset="20467913">Moreover, the burden increases, as in this case, when we have a severability provision, as we do in Section 406.</text>

            <text syncTime="5109.278" offset="20598735">I might point out that in 1962, when... when the final change was made in Section 244(c)(2), to change the group of people who had to go through the one-House veto as opposed to the two-House approval, which still remains for some categories, that that was an amendment and there was no additional severability provision at that time, but the only severability provision is that, and we don't place great reliance on it, but we think it is some additional burden that is placed upon the party seeking to destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.953" offset="20721406">Most of the discussion by the Senate and House here has been offered to show that Congress wanted to retain the veto device.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.277" offset="20758709">Of course it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.652" offset="20764247">It put it in there in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.073" offset="20773964">It augmented the powers of Congress to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.758" offset="20788697">This is not a case in which an outside group was lobbying for inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.804" offset="20808864">This was a provision intended to increase the power of the Congress vis-a-vis the legislature and the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.988" offset="20841569">The proper question, we submit, and the question which is simply stated in another way in Buckley and Champlin, is what would Congress have done if it had known that the veto was unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.702" offset="20888485">The question here is, and it must... I must emphasize that it is a question that we have to ask in each specific case, and I would agree with Justice Rehnquist, for instance, that the question of severability in the Reorganization Act is a much harder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.023" offset="20945745">There are no reorganization powers currently extant, so we don't have to deal with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5209.034" offset="20997781">I think that that is... that is in a way the inquiry which has been made in every one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.970" offset="21017530">Indeed, it is made in the case... cases involving equal protection when we have problems of underinclusion or overinclusion, what would Congress have wanted to do if it knew... if it couldn't have everything in the statute that it wanted to have, and this Court has had to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.417" offset="21079283">The case cited by Mr. Gressman, the California... Califano against Wescott had to deal with precisely the same question, and I might say dealt with it in every case after reaching the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.787" offset="21124736">And I agree that it is difficult in theory, but we have to make these determinations, and in this case, however, we suggest that the legislative history is very strong, and strongly supports the conclusion that Congress would not have, if you will, thrown out the baby with the bath water, if it had been faced with that choice, and I base that on the progression of changes that were made from 1940 through 1962, in which Congress showed a pattern of increasing the categories of eligible people, of making it easier for those found eligible to obtain a hardship stay of deportation, and further from the Congress's willingness to lessen the controls over the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.549" offset="21311773">Indeed, if you put the options as between the private bill analogy, if you strike 242(c)(2), and leave it to the Attorney General alone analogy, Congress between 1948 and 1952 tried the private bill analogy within months after the bill was passed, and that bill required two-House approval upon a recommendation by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.024" offset="21417726">Everybody in Congress said it is unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.099" offset="21425980">They couldn't deal with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.271" offset="21434758">And so finally, in 1952, when the Immigration Act was next amended, they did away with the two-House approval for large segments of the aliens who were seeking hardship adjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.672" offset="21488361">In 1962, there was a further chipping away at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.482" offset="21507587">The Congress consistently made it easier, showed that they did not want the job of going through the private bills.</text>

            <text syncTime="5357.021" offset="21589716">That is, from... the first... the first change was made in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.894" offset="21609256">Congress didn't like the private bill, so they gave up a little of their control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.487" offset="21623571">In 1948, having found that there were 21,000 of these applications that came in between 1940 and 1948, Congress decided it would try to exert a little more control, since it had vetoed none of them during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.278" offset="21674771">In 1948, Congress said, we will exert more control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.980" offset="21689504">In 1952, and in fact before, the next Congress moved in that progression, said, that is unworkable, and in 1962 they have... they continued that even further, and I recognize that you don't have an instant... you can't point to one... one Congress, but even the most recent consideration by the Congress, as the Solicitor General's brief points out, Congress is now considering abandoning the matter entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.720" offset="21788560">And my point is that the Court has to make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.717" offset="21808518">It is not an easy determination to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.060" offset="21817817">You have to try to figure out what Congress would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.434" offset="21835371">But the decisions of this Court make it clear that the burden is upon the party seeking to destroy, and not the party seeking to sever, and we respectfully suggest that it is not evident, as this Court has used the term, that Congress would have wanted to throw out this whole humanitarian program, and indeed perhaps call into question the legality of aliens who have already run the Congressional gauntlet, to throw this entire program out if it could not have retained the veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.890" offset="21949161">It is just too small a portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5448.795" offset="21956789">As the Solicitor General indicated, the vast majority of the people who have to go through the Congress make it through.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.574" offset="21987927">Only two people have been vetoed since 1977, and ten in the previous six or seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.994" offset="22013631">I suggest that the Congress has not made its case for lack of severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.508" offset="22035678">Whatever the case may be under another statute, such as the War Powers Act or Reorganization Act, it hasn't made its case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.566" offset="22067861">Turning to the merits, I want to say that I fully agree with the Solicitor General's position here, support his argument, support the Ninth Circuit, and also the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the Consumer Energy Council case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.451" offset="22127420">I want to focus, if I can, on the separation of powers arguments, and particularly before doing that I want to say a word about the necessary and proper clause upon which counsel for the House places such great reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.445" offset="22183427">It is no doubt true that the necessary and proper clause allowed the Congress to pass the Immigration and Nationality Act and Section 244.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.645" offset="22224178">That is because those were passed by two Houses of Congress, with opportunity for Presidential decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.312" offset="22254898">The question, though, is, does the necessary and proper clause and the alienage clause in Article I, Section 8, authorize the Congress to do what the House of Representatives did in this case, not to pass a statute, but to exercise control over a decision of the executive branch, and we suggest to you that whatever powers the Congress may have, those powers are exercised by two Houses of Congress and the President, with the exception of the specific provisions of the Constitution such as the treaty-making and appointments provision, which are themselves forms of one-House vetoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.985" offset="22409543">The Congress has... the Framers specifically put those in, and as I noted in my brief, this Court in Myers said, we will not lightly imply other forms of one-House vetoes, and that is what we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5657.555" offset="22791871">They were fearful of this concentration of power lest tyranny result, and the tyranny they were concerned with was the tyranny of the legislature, indeed, particularly the House of Representatives, and so whatever irony there may seem to be, I would suggest to you that that is an intentional irony in our Constitutional system, designed to prevent the kind of activity which took place in this case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5695.027" offset="22941709">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.370" offset="22943068">Buckley versus Valeo teaches me that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.354" offset="22947038">I feel compelled... Let me say a word... the Senate... the Congress's response to all of this is, there really isn't a veto here, that all we have is a recommendation going from the Attorney General to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.113" offset="23010046">The difficulty... there are two basic fallacies with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.939" offset="23029376">First is, it mischaracterizes the process we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.562" offset="23043900">If four more days had taken place, had passed, Jagdish Rai Chadha would have successfully run the Congressional gauntlet, and he would now be a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.355" offset="23087055">The fact is that Congress stepped in, not to act with regard to a recommendation, but to veto an act by the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.445" offset="23123417">The only thing that prevented his being a citizen now was his veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="5743.490" offset="23135538">Indeed, the House and Senate reports in 1952, when the process went back from two-House approval to one-House veto, described this process as action by the Congress of an adverse action on the alien, so it is pretty clear in terms it is not that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.327" offset="23206904">Moreover, all doubt is removed if you consider what happened to the other 334 aliens who were up before the Congress at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.214" offset="23242536">According to the Congress, these recommendations were approved by silence, and that silence is the equivalent in constitutional terms to legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.678" offset="23288302">Thus, Justice Brennan, you asked earlier whether Congress still has a role after, for instance, the court of appeals decided something.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.566" offset="23319858">I would say to you that nothing in the statute would change the role.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.049" offset="23333860">It appears that once... the court of appeals would then issue a decision, it would go back to the executive, and then it would go up to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.577" offset="23359982">Our constitutional system provides that laws shall be made by the vote of the House and the Senate, and not by the silence of its Members, yet if you accept the recommendation analysis, you would have to accept that Members can vote by their silence.</text>
