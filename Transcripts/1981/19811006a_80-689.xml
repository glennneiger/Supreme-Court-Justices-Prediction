            <text syncTime="417.161" offset="1801849">There is no general prohibition against their meeting on campus.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.789" offset="1936327">And it is the position of petitioners that those sort of activities are prohibited not only by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, but Missouri's constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.665" offset="2075821">It appears to me, and it is petitioners' argument, that under the facts of this case there is no question, and it's undisputed in the record... it was so found by the trial court and it's admitted by the respondents... that they seek to use university facilities for religious worship services on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.750" offset="2168190">I would submit that as long as the meetings which they wish to seek are with regard to speakers, a meeting of the group for business purposes, that sort of thing, that is not within the purview of the Constitution of prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.195" offset="2241960">But it is the position of petitioners in this case that the facts that were presented to the university left us with no choice but to prohibit the regular religious worship services that were sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.451" offset="3270975">I do not think it's that easy, Mr. Chief Justice, to allow that to... allow the freedom of speech or freedom of assembly clauses to come in in a case of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.398" offset="3326773">It just goes too far, and I realize that that presents some tough or difficult questions, but looking at the history of the establishment clause and what this Court has said it means beginning in 1947 with Justice Black's famous opinion in the Everson case, I just... my opinion would be that if the Court holds that activities such as these are permitted because of the speech clause or the assembly clause, the Court will be making a drastic retrenchment from its prior cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.306" offset="6282475">Your question is whether they are permitted, rather than required, to ban these meetings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.561" offset="13987449">I think that what he did might not be because what he recommended was that professors meet with these students and teach these sectarian principles with them, and that would seem to be more of an establishment of religion than we're asking for right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.021" offset="14073235">And I think this Court might not allow us to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.755" offset="14084206">But we think the main problem with this regulation is that it is an invidious discrimination against religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.984" offset="14133107">A neutral policy has no primary effect of doing anything except promoting inter-communication between students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.590" offset="14171560">In McDaniel v. Paty the court struck down the Tennessee requirement concerning eligibility of ministers to hold public office, and I note in that case that Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall held that that provision violated the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.755" offset="14240209">And I submit to you that this case is a better case to hold that the regulation in this case violates the establishment clause than that one, because of the fact that religion is so clearly given second-class status, it is stigmatized, it's considered as not worthy of being treated the same as the other activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.495" offset="14331220">It's a fallacy to say that when you omit something you say nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.963" offset="14349088">In this case, the university is propagandizing and saying religion does not need to be allowed on the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.678" offset="14379912">We'll meet all the other needs but we will not meet a religious need except maybe we'll favor a few certain religions that are not traditional western religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.112" offset="14421604">We'll allow some eastern religions and things like this, but we will not allow--</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.985" offset="14437173">And the state has decided that religion is compartmentalized and can be off campus, and they have regulation which is arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.245" offset="14486178">It allows worship in chapel at Columbia campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.431" offset="14502897">No chapel at UMPC, and I'm not sure why religion has to be confined to a chapel anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.881" offset="14532676">It's over broad, it by its terms would appear to apply to a bull session in a dormitory late at night where three or four people are talking and one of them maybe has been to Bible school before, so he knows more and so he begins to expound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.954" offset="14597042">It would appear to apply to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.781" offset="14604356">This Court has given the highest degree of protection to religious expression in the past in cases like Tucker vs. State of Texas, Murdock vs. Pennsylvania, Cantwell vs. Connecticut and on and on, and we submit that the government in this case has no business deciding that in a public forum that religion is not entitled to the same treatment as other forms of expressions, even though it is public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.862" offset="14728699">We submit that if the fact that it's public property bothers the Court to some extent, keep in mind the fact that the key is equal accommodation, no favoritism to religion, no sponsorship of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.027" offset="14785333">Just equal accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.902" offset="14792856">This Court's been very sensitive in the past to government actions promoting religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.213" offset="14814067">For instance, Stone vs. Graham; so sensitive, in fact, that you reversed the decision of the Kentucky court without even hearing arguments; you reversed it outright on petition for cert. I submit that this Court also can be just as sensitive to government hostility to religion as it has been for government promotion and sponsorship of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.469" offset="14899122">Particularly at the university, which is the marketplace of ideas, and religion should be allowed to find... to be placed in its own spectrum by the marketplace in which it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.151" offset="14961816">The students will put it where it needs to be.</text>
