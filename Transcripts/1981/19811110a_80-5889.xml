            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="125809">We will hear arguments first this morning in Santosky against Kramer.</text>

            <text syncTime="13.620" offset="180248">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the state may permanently destroy a family when it is not clear that the evidence justifies doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.975" offset="237613">It is the Petitioners' position that the Constitution requires that the finder of fact be reasonably convinced that the result of permanent destruction of the family is appropriate before the state may force such an irrevocable and fundamental deprivation of liberty on an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.170" offset="330400">New York and eleven other states permit the permanent destruction of a family based on quality of evidence which is sufficient to prove liability in an automobile accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.961" offset="385571">This is offensive to basic notions of due process.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="68.834" offset="401140">Well, Mr. Guggenheim, I realize that your point is certainly legally well taken, but do you think your client would have been better served by the rather searching family court inquiries in this case; albeit they were said to be made upon the preponderance of the evidence rather than a very short hearing in the family court which announced that it found by "clear and convincing evidence" that parental rights should be terminated and it was affirmed by the appellate division?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="martin_guggenheim" startTime="103.336" stopTime="173.040">
            <label>Mr. Martin Guggenheim</label>
            <text syncTime="103.336" offset="539066">Absolutely, not only in this case but in the 1,200 other cases litigated in New York each year on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.738" offset="572712">It would of a measurable and real value, a benefit to parents because, as Justice Harlan indicated in Winship, what the standard of proof does, what the setting of a constitutional standard of proof does is impress upon the finder of fact the degree of confidence in the judgment which is to be rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.039" offset="689949">Now, if your question, Justice Rehnquist, is whether under any reading of this case a higher standard would have been met, the test for harmless error in constitutional adjudication is a reasonable doubt test set forth in Chapman against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.405" offset="783363">The question would be whether any reasonable person could have found that this did not amount to clear and convincing evidence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="173.040" stopTime="217.898">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="173.040" offset="817949">No, my question was directed more to the practicality matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.868" offset="837280">The family court devoted considerable time, and wrote out its conclusions, and held more than one hearing on the matter, and the fact that it ended up concluding that it was by the preponderance of the evidence strikes me as being a rather technical point which could have been obviated by a much shorter and less searching inquiry than simply a boilerplate finding at the end that we find this by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="martin_guggenheim" startTime="217.898" stopTime="274.688">
            <label>Mr. Martin Guggenheim</label>
            <text syncTime="217.898" offset="997358">Courts have regularly reviewed records upon a higher standard of proof, appellate courts have, and in this case, the test before the appellate division was merely whether the evidence did justify the result by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.406" offset="1079383">There is both an impression to be made upon the finder of fact of the degree of confidence he or she should have in making the finding, as well as an entire change of the direction of the case, of the scope of the issue before an appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.321" offset="1147092">The burden is more squarely placed upon the state, and the question for review is whether they have met that burden by convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.254" offset="1182723">I do think that this is a practical and meaningful right being sought, both for the 1,200 cases each year and for this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.688" offset="1224519">From the size of the record in this case, is it not quite clear that the judge gave it very close attention, and made an exhaustive inquiry?</text>

            <text syncTime="288.401" offset="1279376">There is no challenge being made to the process attendant to the proceedings or to the judge's own careful analysis of his opinion other than a steadfast refusal to both declare the statute unconstitutional insofar as it required a higher standard of proof and a refusal to rule that by that higher standard of proof this same result would have been effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.263" offset="1418766">The trial court judge did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.183" offset="1430469">The appellate court, the third department, appellate division, affirmed expressly finding that the evidence satisfied the preponderance standard, and expressly finding that a higher standard was not constitutionally mandated.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.923" offset="1513433">Send this record back and tell them, look at this record again and applying the correct standard, or to retry it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.524" offset="5771811">We do know, as this Court in Sumner against Mather just last term, Justice Rehnquist's opinion pointed out that the difference between overturning a conviction based upon the preponderance of the evidence and overturning a conviction by convincing evidence, as Section 2254(D) of the habeas corpus statute requires, means something.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.405" offset="6639389">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Respondent requests that the judgment of the New York State Supreme Court be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.870" offset="6673244">At issue before the Court is the constitutionality of a comprehensive state plan dealing with an important state interest in an area of domestic relations traditionally regarded as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.661" offset="6736356">The New York permanent neglect statute is the result of a delicate balancing of competing and intertwined interests between multiple parties whose rights and relationships are affected by all the branches of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.357" offset="6799154">We don't feel, in light of the record in this case, that a different standard of proof would vary the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.915" offset="6837398">However, if the Court should raise the burden, it would frustrate a specific intent of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.538" offset="6871879">In 1976, there was commissioned the Temporary Commission on Child Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.910" offset="6901345">It undertook a year-long study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.581" offset="6912108">These results are published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.283" offset="6922870">They are cited extensively throughout Robert Abrams' brief, the Attorney General for New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.578" offset="6940111">This extensive study was the basis for the present law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.950" offset="6957561">There is a risk of error here which Petitioners are challenging is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.245" offset="6982743">The legislature has evaluated this very risk of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.571" offset="7004059">Its conclusion, based on that year-long study, was that under the preponderance standard, the risk of error ran considerably in favor of the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.379" offset="7055259">It went farther than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.659" offset="7068425">That was certainly the main conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.548" offset="7075948">However, it also determined that raising the burden would shorten the reach of the statute, which is precisely what the legislature did not want to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.805" offset="10948967">That was enough for the trial judge to say, yes, these people are utilizing the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.194" offset="10974567">They are taking advantage of them, and thus planning for the future of their children under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.159" offset="10994420">That stands in stark contrast to the second termination proceeding in February of 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.017" offset="11465773">The evidence, the failure to utilize those services, indicated a state of mind of the parents, that these parents had virtually abandoned their children at that termination proceeding in April of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.839" offset="11529094">The trial court described their meetings between parent and child as devoid of any type of emotional contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.133" offset="11562322">The children viewed those meetings as something merely to be endured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.897" offset="11577368">Throughout the course... this is six years... before the same trial judge, as... that's the practice; once the initial removal proceeding is instituted, the case remains before the same trial judge, who takes judicial notice of all the prior proceedings... the Santoskys never asked when their children would be returned home permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.887" offset="11665349">Judge Elwin based his decision, as he had to under New York law, on a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.711" offset="11712578">However, the strength of his decision is not... his decision is not one of a man who had any reservations about his factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.036" offset="11749881">He asserted that the Santoskys' failure to utilize these services was total and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.362" offset="11775167">Their miniscule efforts had tapered off to the point where he could not even measure them as an experienced trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.437" offset="11799513">It has been nine years since the initial abuse of Tina, and this case cries out to be ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.872" offset="11825218">I would like to close with the contention that there is a logical fallacy in Petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.538" offset="11883941">They are isolating their whole challenge on a comprehensive, very well thought out state scheme on only one particular procedural protection in the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.315" offset="11931066">The statute, with all those protections, all those hearings, has to be evaluated as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.818" offset="12845038">The question of the rights of the children and the rights of the parents here are, as Justice Stevens suggested just a moment ago, before the Court in the same context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.733" offset="12908673">It begs the question to suggest that their interests are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.621" offset="12932287">They may be and they may not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.152" offset="12942318">Chief Justice Burger indicated in questions to Mr. Scavuzzo that judges around the country, commentators have told us, frequently regard the decision to terminate of such a great moment that they want to be convinced that it is the right thing to do before they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.753" offset="13024761">That is because, if it is true, we have recognized as a society the social disutility of an erroneous permanent destruction of a family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.592" offset="13064153">This case merely would suggest that that social disutility is of constitutional moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.026" offset="13097904">If, as Chief Justice Burger has stated, the commentators correctly to be correct and people are doing this already, then very little is lost by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.007" offset="13141789">But if people are not doing it, if children are being destroyed needlessly, then this case will protect them, and that should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.958" offset="13177629">Even where, and the record shows this, permanent destruction is effected, adoption, which could be the only feasible benefit accruing to the children, is effected only about 40 percent of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.107" offset="13246175">So we have children... 60 percent of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.215" offset="13258609">I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.637" offset="13260281">Forty percent of the cases, permanent adoption is not effected for children free for adoption by this route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.430" offset="13283478">So, we have a preponderance of the evidence terminating rights where it benefits children at best a preponderance of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.349" offset="13323184">The Constitution requires more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.878" offset="13333319">If there are no further questions, I will stop at this point.</text>
