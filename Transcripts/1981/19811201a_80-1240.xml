            <text syncTime="70.929" offset="401512">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on a petition for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.302" offset="442994">The issue presented is whether the court of appeals decision conflicts with this Court's 1979 decision in United States versus Timmreck, and thereby goes beyond those due process requirements required for a knowing and voluntary guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.312" offset="502971">In other words, does Timmreck mandate a contrary result?</text>
            <text syncTime="100.532" offset="519899">It is our position that the court of appeals decision does indeed conflict with Timmreck.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.816" offset="541006">We believe that if any error occurred, it was only a failure to comply with the formal requirements of Illinois Supreme Court Rule 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.439" offset="575487">That is the Illinois rule which pertains to the entry of guilty pleas, and it is the state counterpart to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which was the issue, or which was the rule involved in Timmreck.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.099" offset="626165">We also submit that Rule 402 is very similar in content to the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 11... Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.205" offset="666602">Therefore, we believe--</text>

            <text syncTime="143.624" offset="692307">As I understand it, the relief granted by Judge Marshall, was it, in this case, was to cancel the three-year mandatory parole term, to modify the sentence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael B. Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="162.336" offset="767122">The question arose in the Seventh Circuit the first time it was before the Seventh Circuit, and that court ruled and, we believe, correctly, that there were certain collateral consequences that would attach to the Petitioners... at that time there were three, actually four... if the use of their parole term or the fact that they had violated parole and had started to serve a parole term could later be used if they committed another crime in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.573" offset="900033">However, more importantly, perhaps, we perceive a situation of, because the parole terms are so short... at that time they were five, three, and two years, and now they have been modified by statute to three, two, and one... we have a situation where we have a problem which is capable of repetition yet evading review.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="217.136" offset="986341">Well, but all the judge has to do is order... I mean, if he had granted relief in the form of requiring that the man be allowed to plead again, to enter a new plea, then it wouldn't be moot, because you would set aside the judgment of guilt, which would seem to me to be the correct relief on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.932" offset="1049453">I don't understand the relief on habeas corpus where you modify a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.634" offset="1064291">Where does the judge get the power to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.086" offset="1070142">I assume that... and far be it from me to assume what Judge Marshall felt, but I assume that his feeling was that it would be unfair to allow the individuals to replead because in fact they had already started serving their time, that is, the mandatory parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.445" offset="1139523">If they were allowed to replead, the state could then prosecute them all over again, and who knows--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="262.034" offset="1165855">Well, maybe they are unwise to seek that relief, but isn't that the only relief the statute offered them?</text>

            <text syncTime="265.653" offset="1180379">--Well, the Seventh Circuit didn't allow that type of relief in Baker versus Finkbeiner, which was the first case, and Judge Marshall was obviously applying the Baker case to these particular facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.127" offset="1346309">The point that I want to make is that Judge Marshall has before him a class action involving the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.781" offset="1380895">He has certified the class already.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.547" offset="1388000">I assume that if this Court were to determine that this case were moot, and from our particular standpoint, of course, the decision would be vacated and we would technically win, nevertheless Judge Marshall will probably go ahead and still make the same ruling with regard to the class, and we would be back... well, we may not be back here--</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.584" offset="5784095">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we are talking about a... just one issue in this case, and that is the fairness of a negotiated plea agreement where one of the sides to the agreement did not live up to its bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.129" offset="5858282">The Timmreck case, I think, is not applicable to this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.831" offset="5873120">In the first place, it was not the same kind of plea bargain, and to the extent that there was a plea bargain, the bargain in that case was kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.068" offset="5902064">Timmreck plead guilty to one charge, with an agreement with the prosecutor to drop certain other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.305" offset="5931007">There was no agreement with the court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.738" offset="5940725">The charges were dropped that the prosecutor agreed to drop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.673" offset="5952428">So in that sense his plea agreement was kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.042" offset="5961936">The court was not a party to that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.761" offset="5972803">The court merely informed him of the sentence, later sentenced him to a term which included mandatory parole, which he had not told him about, but that was not highly relevant in his case as the maximum sentence he got was well within the range that he was informed in the first place, i.e., 15 years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael B. Weinstein</label>
            <text syncTime="2263.052" offset="9169982">Very shortly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.387" offset="9175311">With regard to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's comment that the Illinois courts are not bound by the Seventh Circuit decisions, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.041" offset="9201956">They are not bound by the Seventh Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.057" offset="9210002">They are only bound by the decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.659" offset="9220451">However, we have a practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.278" offset="9226929">If the Seventh Circuit is going to hold that mandatory parole term admonishments must be given as a matter of constitutional law, the Illinois courts consistently say, no, you are out of the ball park, each petitioner is simply going to file a federal habeas corpus petition, and presumably he will win in the Northern District of Illinois, because the Northern District of Illinois is required to follow the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.524" offset="9311879">Ms. Mills has talked a great deal about the bargain that was involved in this case, and we don't see a bargain having been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.166" offset="9358482">We don't see the prosecutor having made any kind of promise or agreement that would be part of the inducement or consideration, in the language of Santobello.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.788" offset="9392963">The mandatory parole term in Illinois attached automatically to every sentence involving incarceration, every felony sentence involving incarceration, whether these individuals had received a one-year sentence or a 20-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.013" offset="9445835">There was nothing the prosecutor could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.797" offset="9452940">There was nothing the judge could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.881" offset="9457329">It was going to be in there, no matter what.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.566" offset="9464016">With regard to whether or not the public defender had a duty to inform his client and that type of questioning, it is quite possible he did, but keep in mind that at the time that these pleas were entered, this Krantz decision was... appeared to be the law in Illinois, and presuming that the individuals were aware of the Krantz decision, and I am sure that they were, they could only have read into that decision that in fact no admonishment need be given at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.657" offset="9604346">Krantz subsequently was overturned, at least in that portion, by the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.560" offset="9623990">But we can't really fault the prosecutor and the defense counsel and, for that matter, the Judge for not giving the mandatory parole term admonishment when Illinois law appeared to say you didn't have to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.849" offset="9669130">Unless there is anything further, I thank you very much.</text>
