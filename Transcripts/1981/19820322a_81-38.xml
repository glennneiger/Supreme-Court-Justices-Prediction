            <text syncTime="89.915" offset="500441">This case brings to the Court a judgment of the California Court of Appeal upholding an amendment to the California Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.211" offset="533564">Proposition One enacted a special statewide election to, and I quote from the analysis of the Legislative Analyst,</text>

            <text syncTime="126.711" offset="647563">What is intriguing about the case is whether it is permissible for a state, in its constitution which provides generous protection for educational equality across the board, to single out the right not to be subject to what the California Courts have called racial isolation, and to single it out by saying that as to that right, the only remedies available are those that a Federal Court, in the same circumstances, would order.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.349" offset="770129">We submit that that is not permissible, and the Petitioners in this case--</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="174.626" offset="839197">If the states wanted to cut back on their equal protection clause in a neutral way, and to say, in general, they will not go beyond the federal Constitution, that would surely be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.417" offset="882351">The State of California has not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.250" offset="893740">The State of California, as the decision below expressly holds, continues to create rights to be free of racially segregated schooling regardless of cause broader than the rights that are conferred under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.830" offset="968033">The rights, substantively, have been completely unchanged by Proposition One.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.782" offset="983915">Moreover, the court below held that the duty on the school board to take affirmative steps, including mandatory pupil reassignment if and when necessary, remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.423" offset="1026443">What is now different, and it is different only with respect to desegregation, not with respect to school finance or any other area.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.778" offset="1059879">What is different is that with respect to school desegregation now, after Proposition One, one cannot use the Courts of California to get any and all necessary remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.586" offset="1107109">One must limit oneself to those remedies that a federal court, with all of the institutional limits on federal courts, would order in that very case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="252.359" offset="1150158">Is it analogous to a State Norris-LaGuardia Act?</text>

          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="256.513" stopTime="356.676">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="256.513" offset="1166772">It is analogous, I think, to a state racially specific Norris LaGuardia Act that says in, for example, racial labor disputes, as opposed to other labor disputes, the state courts cannot enter certain remedies unless federal courts would do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.170" offset="1225391">It seems to me that the closest analogy is really in this case clearly Hunter v. Erickson, but in a way this case is a lot worse than Hunter v. Erickson for this reason: What is important in this case is not the sort of education that the petitioners, the minority students of Los Angeles, are receiving or will receive as a result of Proposition One.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.340" offset="1334060">That matters in the world, but the legal issue here is somewhat narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.958" offset="1348585">The legal issue here is not even the degree of racial isolation and separation to which petitioners will be fated by virtue of Proposition One.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.330" offset="1390067">The issue is the special way in which Proposition One creates a two-track judicial system in California, a dual court system in which only those seeking redress from racial isolation in violation of state law must be satisfied with less than full relief from a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.833" offset="1500095">They must, instead, persuade the school board, which is typically the defendant in the case, the entity said to be in default of their continuing obligations under state law, that the school board has been remiss in not ordering certain remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.873" offset="2516258">Even if it were true that the State of California had taken the further step, which it denies it has taken and which the court below denies, and had surgically removed racial segregation from the list of wrongs in the educational world as to which California law provides a more generous standard by not inquiring into cause, and by allowing a broad range of remedies, including inter-district remedies, that would truly have been the withdrawal on a race specific basis, not on a neutral basis, of one right and one right only.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.165" offset="2665365">That seems to me, under Hunter v. Erickson, this court is not necessarily prepared to counternance.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.011" offset="3268794">In Hunter v. Erickson, the crucial racial distinction that was drawn, as the court pointed out, was not between blacks and whites, not between various groups of people, religious or racial.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.903" offset="3320307">The crucial distinction that was drawn, the court said, was between racial housing matters and other racial and housing matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.960" offset="3360536">So that the example that this court gave was that those people, for example, who wanted to pass rent control laws, or laws increasing protection from negligent landlords or building codes, had an easier time vindicating their goals through the state's legal system than did those people who wanted to end racial discrimination in housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.361" offset="3466175">What this measure does, without any doubt, on its face since it refers to school integration, when talking about what school boards can voluntarily do... what it does without any doubt is create a special obstacle, not just to translating goals of racial equality into not yet existent law that doesn't apply elsewhere, but a special obstacle to vindicating state created rights of racial equality which does not apply when one is trying to vindicate state created rights of educational equality in the financial area, in decisions like Serrano.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.688" offset="3631478">I do not think that it is right to say that racial animus must be shown in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.424" offset="3658436">Indeed, in Washington v. Davis itself, this court approvingly cited Hunter v. Erickson for the proposition that when a law on its face creates a racial classification that imposes a greater obstacle to racial minorities, or to minority rights, than it does in other analogous areas, at that point one doesn't need to take the next step and show discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.980" offset="3784660">Indeed, Justice Powell in his Bakke decision distinguished Arlington v. Heights from an explicit racial classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.348" offset="5154103">And that is, with respect to Arlington Heights, not only was there no determination of any kind about racially impermissible impact and purpose by the trial court, because it didn't think Proposition One was even an issue in the case, but the Court of Appeals conducted no inquiry remotely resembling what the Court required in Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.948" offset="5244487">The Court of Appeals said that it was a sufficient answer to all of our allegations and all of the evidence that we had yet to introduce to any tribunal, but that is in this record, a sufficient answer that in its face there was written into Proposition One a non-racial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.842" offset="5324108">Well, my goodness, if that's all it takes to satisfy Arlington Heights, if all you have to do is say in the law, we're not trying to do this because of race, then Arlington Heights becomes a meaningless precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.967" offset="5368620">The Court of Appeals went on to say that because the proposition could have been motivated by considerations other than race, it would necessarily be too speculative to conduct a hearing on how in fact it was motivated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1330.415" offset="5462348">At a minimum, therefore, if the Court were not to agree that this is an impermissible explicit racial classification violative of Hunter, there would have to be either a remand under Arlington Heights or a determination that on this record this is so plainly designed to restrict desegregation, not just to restrict racial balance but to restrict the use of California's courts to achieve desegregation, that it on its face is impermissibly motivated, or that the evidence so clearly shows it to be impermissibly motivated that you don't need a further hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.614" offset="5979154">But, number one, it might well be that the only effective relief from de jure segregation is an inter-district remedy that this Court under Milliken, partly out of deference to the state courts, would not be willing to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.624" offset="6035265">And yet a California court prior to Proposition One would have had no reluctance to do it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="1483.312" offset="6074031">But the reason perhaps that you don't have any federal right is deference to states' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.383" offset="6094302">And it seems to me perverse to make that deference to states' rights the reason for states to close their doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.101" offset="6113110">But what about de facto segregation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.537" offset="6122932">California has chosen in the area of education to say what this Court, partly out of institutional and federal-state concern, was unwilling to say in Rodriguez, that education is a fundamental right, therefore that you don't need to show deliberate denial of equality as a matter of California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.117" offset="6205166">The failure to show that would prevent one from getting federal relief in school finance cases and in desegregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.322" offset="6242051">But it's only in desegregation cases that it would have the further effect of now requiring that in order to get relief from the illegality you have to persuade the other side, the school board that is in default of its duties under state law, that it must do something for you, and if you don't persuade them that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.172" offset="6337450">It's very much like what the Court observed was unconstitutional in Boddie v. Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.492" offset="6354691">That is, when the state makes it impossible for you to vindicate your rights without full resort to the state judicial system, but then cuts off that resort to the state judicial system, it is violating your rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.001" offset="6420728">Now, that was true in Boddie v. Connecticut partly because a fundamental federal right was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.905" offset="6444343">The analogue in this case of that fundamental federal right is that the limitation on access to courts is race specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.527" offset="6478825">The line surely is drawn between desegregation and school finance even if it turns out that there's no line drawn between desegregation and problems of handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.467" offset="6518635">But we submit that the belated suggestion by the school board, for the first time in this entire litigation, that perhaps Proposition One wasn't directed just to desegregation, that perhaps it was directed at problems of handicapped and overcrowding as well, is utterly and facially incredible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.546" offset="6594913">Never in the history of this litigation until the filing of the most recent round of briefs in this Court has it been suggested by the school board, by any other Respondent, that Proposition One has nothing to do with race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.206" offset="6653531">Indeed, if that were true there would have been a very simple answer for the Court of Appeals to give to the Hunter v. Erickson argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.877" offset="6680281">When we argued to the Court of Appeals that this was a race specific obstacle to the enforcement of rights, in violation of Hunter versus Erickson, it would have said presumably, no, we don't construe it as being race specific at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.453" offset="6734511">But instead the court below said, how could it be a violation of your federal rights when it explicitly embraces the Fourteenth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.892" offset="6772336">That was the only answer to the Hunter versus Erickson argument below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.944" offset="6788532">We submit that when rights of racial equality are reduced in a state's law to what the Fourteenth Amendment as enforced by federal courts would do, while analogous rights are more generously treated, it is no answer to say that the Fourteenth Amendment is good enough for the federal courts and it had therefore better be good enough for minorities as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.230" offset="6909636">It can take it away as long as it does not do so on a race specific basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.684" offset="6927504">For example, if the State of California had taken a view analogous to that of this Court in Rodriguez about school finance and had just said in the one limited area of race that we will no longer worry about whether something is de jure and defacto, we will give a broader set of rights, and had then taken that back either by judicial decision or by constitutional change, we would not be in this Court arguing that that was a race specific change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.252" offset="7033770">It might be race specific in the trivial sense that when you give something to members of a minority race and then take it back that's race specific by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.357" offset="7070132">But this Court has not, as the Dayton decisions show, equated that with a racial classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.011" offset="7092807">That's very different from saying across the board in the educational realm, we will confer broader rights and now we'll take them back from minorities alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.033" offset="7124885">This law clearly at least does that, and we submit it does more, because what it does is say, you all have all of these rights, they're wonderful, they're like a teasing illusion... a munificent bequest in a pauper's will, Justice Jackson once called it... because although you have these rights the only way you can vindicate them is by persuading the person who's in default of its obligation with respect to these rights, the school board, that it should voluntarily confess error and make correction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.721" offset="7467611">Clearly, the focus of this law on its face is desegregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.261" offset="7513796">This is not a case, it seems to me, about desegregation or schooling as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.832" offset="7532082">It is a case about the fundamental question of whether a state may structure its court system so that we have a system of dual courts, courts fully capable of remedying, with the full panoply of necessary remedies, rights that relate to education, unless those rights involve claims of racial equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.079" offset="7621003">This Court in 1963 in the case of Johnson against Virginia held that racially segregated courtrooms are per se unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.060" offset="7812950">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.682" offset="7843461">Throughout the course of this lengthy litigation, the Petitioners have always asserted that the decisions of this Court and the lower courts in the federal system, as well as the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, should be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.483" offset="7946697">Proposition One accepts that argument by making all of those the governing standard in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.373" offset="7998211">I submit that the key to the constitutionality of this Proposition One is the very adoption of the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.716" offset="8067592">All the provisions of One... and I'll take them up in a minute... yield to the supremacy of the federal Constitution, and Proposition One has no racial classification in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.290" offset="8125897">Now, let me first of all turn, because of the remarks of counsel for the Petitioners... I want to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.581" offset="8171037">He said specifically that the court below did not address itself to the issue of whether it was race specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.389" offset="8210325">I can understand that a new argument is being made here, and it is a new argument, and that is, that's the only reason I bring it up, that is why the Court of Appeals did not address itself when the case was argued below to any charge of being race specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.736" offset="8295693">There were two issues argued below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.255" offset="8309799">One was that the findings of the court, the trial court in 1970, which contrary to the statement that has just been made were incorporated by the trial judge in the decision which led to the Court of Appeal decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.799" offset="8383883">The 1980 decision on Proposition One, incorporated those same 1970 findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.255" offset="8417737">And I call the Court's attention to the fact that from pages 11 to 49 of the opinion of the court below in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, that's an entire discussion of those findings, with the conclusion being set forth that those findings did not constitute a de jure violation by this school board under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.643" offset="8551275">So that was the point that was first made below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.780" offset="8567889">The balance of that opinion, commencing on page 50, solely dealt with the constitutionality of Proposition One.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.521" offset="8614805">So the argument of racial classification is new and being raised for the first time in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.193" offset="8649496">And I submit that if you look at the language of Proposition One... and I'm referring particularly to the response that counsel for Petitioners made to--</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.851" offset="8704144">Justice O'Connor's question... it is the position of the school district that Proposition One in its language does not limit, does not limit its reach either in the constitutional restraints on the state and the invoking of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the provision restraining the state courts unless there's a Fourteenth Amendment violation and a decision which would support the remedy involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.507" offset="8846772">It is not limited to school desegregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.994" offset="8864745">Nowhere... and I'm looking at the first page of the proposition as it appears in the appendix to our brief in this Court... nowhere is there any limitation that, for example, would not involve overcrowding of schools or handicapped children, in the illustration given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.907" offset="8952411">And then Petitioners' counsel finds what in Proposition One to establish it's race specific?</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.049" offset="9000895">He turns to the proviso clause, which says that nothing in it, nothing in One, shall prevent a school board from using, any California school board, from using mandatory busing or reassignment of students in a school segregation problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.247" offset="9089711">So he takes that and lifts it to the whole Proposition One and says, there is your race specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.151" offset="9121371">Or he goes another way and he says, look at the court section, the restraint on the court section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.821" offset="9151987">Only to remedy... a court in California can only use mandatory assignment of students or transportation of those students to remedy a specific violation of what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.283" offset="9225861">A violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and impose a remedy which would be permitted under a federal court interpreting that violation and applying a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.959" offset="9288555">From that he urges this Court to say that this is a racial classification because it sets up a two-tier, a second class court system in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.885" offset="9348323">If California in Proposition One does so, I submit, only gives the courts in that one instance the same powers that you give the lower federal courts, that is hardly creating a second class judicial system, because that has been created by the decisions of this Court under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.525" offset="10334811">In the decision below at page 54 in the same reporting in the appendix of the petition for certiorari, they did say that that obligation remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.766" offset="10383817">Justice Rehnquist, if that obligation remained then the courts could order the establishment, if they did need to, establishment of a magnet school, or they could order other things, as long as it did not involve the reassignment or transportation on a mandatory basis of the pupils.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.990" offset="10744725">I'm not saying so, because I would hope that other school districts would emulate us, where we have established magnet schools and where we now have an ongoing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.946" offset="10784536">But all I meant to bring out is that there is implicit in Proposition One a broader power in the state courts in that sense than even a federal court would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.903" offset="10828317">But the attendance would be simply voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.188" offset="10845453">The racial classification argument, which I think as I heard counsel is relying primarily under the Hunter against Erickson situation, I think is readily distinguishable because there was clearly there, just as we go back in the older case of Yik Wo or in Gomillion against Lightfoot... it was too clear that there, when you were interfering and putting a special premium on the getting a charter amendment in Akron that required to go out and get a majority vote, when up to that time the minorities involved were only obliged to get what any other ordinance would be, the councilmanic reading, instead of going to the electorate... that you've a clear case for violating a race and making a racial classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.723" offset="11155579">But you cannot take that and lift it, and it seems to me this Court in almost a comparable problem in James against Valtierra later declined, where the obvious impact or character was lessened by the fact that you only had low cost housing involved in that case, and you refused then to follow and extend the Hunter doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.041" offset="11264875">I would like to conclude by discussing what I interpreted was their second effort to persuade you to reverse the court below, and that is that this proposition had a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.620" offset="11351184">Now, in support of that argument... they even seem to concede that it doesn't say so on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.928" offset="11396428">And they can't point to... they point to no evidence below of that purpose to establish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.451" offset="11434567">What they really point to is a collection, a miscellaneous collection of newspapers, campaign literature, and historical treatises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.008" offset="11488797">I have made the point in our brief that none of that was admitted below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.281" offset="11521816">It wasn't considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.233" offset="11525682">Now, there is a suggestion in this latest reply brief on the part of Petitioners that the least you should do with this case, the very least, is send it back and give them a chance to prove that intent, that discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.662" offset="11611363">And they say there was no remand, therefore you should remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.514" offset="11630798">I submit if you look at the very last words of the opinion below, as it appears at the end on page 70A of the same appendix, and I quote:</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.503" offset="11766740">"remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.675" offset="11795474">But not only was the court below remanding, but a remand was held and there was another trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.947" offset="11832568">There was a trial in the summer of 1981, where the Petitioners in face of that remand with notice had every opportunity to offer evidence of this discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.993" offset="11904666">And they offered none, no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.445" offset="11922534">And I call to the Court's attention that this was in effect the fifth trial, and if they had this purpose in mind, this discriminatory purpose, when Proposition One... and the chronology is that the long trial involving Plan Three started in October of 1979 and continued to April of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.095" offset="12037159">But by 15 days after trial started, Proposition One had been passed by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.534" offset="12070909">And we asked the court then now to apply Proposition One.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.538" offset="12098913">That trial lasted for six months and if there was any thought by then that this had a discriminatory purpose, that was their first opportunity to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.580" offset="12143007">And they had a second opportunity in the second trial after the remand by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.518" offset="12174772">It seems to me, Your Honors, with all due respect, that what Petitioners are asking you to do here is to in effect overrule your decisions where you have required under the Fourteenth Amendment in school cases a deliberate discriminatory intentional purpose, and establish that rule in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.359" offset="12314162">And I urge you that in this case Proposition One should be upheld because it does match the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, and I respectfully close by urging you to affirm the decision below.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="3071.942" offset="12428474">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.246" offset="12445714">Petitioners' attack on the constitutionality of Proposition One is a very narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.698" offset="12467553">It's narrow because it has to be, and it turns on whether Proposition One really means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.720" offset="12495660">The argument is that under Hunter v. Erickson there is a constitutional inequality in access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.540" offset="12526903">Because of this Court's holding in James v. Valtierra, which was very closely observed, that argument is foreclosed unless the Petitioners can persuade this Court that, contrary to the clear language of Proposition One itself, it prohibits court-ordered busing only for integration purposes and not for any other purposes as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.953" offset="12612585">Petitioners' contention that this case is governed by Hunter v. Erickson is insufficient for two reasons: First, this is not a Hunter v. Erickson case, for the same reason that James v. Valtierra was not a Hunter v. Erickson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.229" offset="12673607">In Valtierra this Court upheld a California voter amendment to the state constitution which provided that no federally funded low rent housing project could be developed by a state body without approval by a majority of those voting in a community election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.139" offset="12729300">The parallel to Hunter v. Erickson was remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.091" offset="12741107">Nevertheless, the Court held that it could hold that California voter amendment unconstitutional only by extending Hunter v. Erickson, which, in the language of this Court, "we decline to do".</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.796" offset="12783948">And the reason was that, and I'm quoting again,</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.898" offset="12796278">"The article requires referendum approval for any low rent public housing project, not only for projects which will be occupied by a racial minority. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.088" offset="12833058">In order to get over the Valtierra hurdle, therefore, the Petitioners have to show that court-ordered busing applies only to busing for racial balance purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.162" offset="12873391">This they cannot do and this they have not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.181" offset="12889483">The reason is that the relevant language simply will not yield to their rewriting efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.085" offset="12913097">It prohibits, in relevant terms, judicial imposition... and I am quoting...</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.739" offset="12935667">"of any obligation with respect to. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.844" offset="12968163">What the Petitioners would like it to prohibit is any obligation with respect to pupil transportation for the purpose of achieving racial balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.925" offset="13168470">But there is nowhere, absolutely nowhere in that Court of Appeals opinion, that says that the only purpose for which court-ordered busing is prohibited is for racial balance purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.935" offset="13224477">Now, it is true that on five or six different occasions the Court of Appeals does refer to the fact that this prohibits the use of court-ordered busing for desegregation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.457" offset="13262511">But nowhere does that court opinion say or does any other authoritative interpretation by the California authorities say that it's only for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.312" offset="13305979">The only authoritative ruling that you have on that subject comes from the California Attorney General, and his view is, as it must be, that the amendment means what it says.</text>

            <text syncTime="3887.138" offset="15689287">It is not a sufficient answer to that argument to say that it is race specific in that instance, because all that is really saying is once again that it really is a ratchet wrench, that you can't really back off once you've tried something and it doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.682" offset="15763474">Because by definition any effort at racial imbalance must fit the Petitioners' definition of what is a race specific classification, because there is nothing in this particular case to differentiate it from any other.</text>

            <text syncTime="3936.385" offset="15886250">To begin with, I suppose I should note that no argument is any longer being made by the board in this case that there is some compelling justification for this measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.109" offset="15933166">Unlike the Seattle law, for example, there's no suggestion that this is genuinely a neighborhood policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.247" offset="15957721">Students can be forcibly bused out of their neighborhoods if the school board realizes or agrees that that's what it ought to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.769" offset="15987814">So what we're left with is the question of whether either on its face or under Arlington Heights it is a racial classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="3981.063" offset="16065032">It says if it's a statistical coincidence that that's not race specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.682" offset="16083422">Indeed, in Hunter what Section 137 added was race and religion to a list that already included taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.538" offset="16114874">It can't make a difference whether it's in one law or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.490" offset="16126681">It seems to me very clear that if an obstacle is put in the way of racial minorities as such, even if a couple of other obstacles are thrown in for good measure, that does not invoke James v. Valtierra by any stretch of the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.750" offset="16183732">A word about Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.683" offset="16191465">It's simply not the case that opportunities have been bypassed to try to show racially discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.169" offset="16217378">Proof was introduced, but its admissibility was never ruled on because the trial court thought that the validity of Proposition One was immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.092" offset="16249143">And there was a remand from the Court of Appeal, but expressly limited to the question of what to do now that the Court of Appeal had decided Proposition One was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.817" offset="16295954">No evidence was allowed on remand on the very question on which no evidence has yet been heard in this case, namely whether Proposition One was motivated by desire to impose greater obstacles to racial minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.827" offset="16352065">So I do think that at a very minimum the failure to apply Arlington Heights was fatal below.</text>

            <text syncTime="4086.297" offset="16485917">Well, the Court of Appeals said, number one, that the 1970 findings didn't establish any purposeful discrimination by the board.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="4093.917" offset="16516428">And then as to Proposition One it said that, because it has a disclaimer on its face and because it could have been properly motivated, it follows that there need be no inquiry under Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.592" offset="16563135">That is surely a misstatement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.126" offset="16573270">But we don't even need to reach Arlington Heights, because I think it is very clear, as Justice White has pointed out, that even if something hits explicitly race plus something else the explicit attention to race imposing an obstacle to racial minorities independently triggers the strictest scrutiny, which can't be satisfied here because there's no compelling justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.576" offset="16663027">More than that, the suggestion of the Solicitor General that we have here one of these very difficult cases where the law on its face is simply incompatible perhaps with what the Court of Appeals said, and then you try to figure out what to do, is untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.502" offset="16722795">The law on its face, as Justice Stevens points out, clearly suggests in light of the fact that the California constitution when it comes to pupil assignment had added nothing outside the area of race, clearly suggests that it's only race that's being spoken of.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.345" offset="16782145">But if there were ambiguity the Court of Appeals would have settled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.980" offset="16796669">On page 59A of the appendix to the petition for certiorari, it is specifically said by the Court of Appeals that Proposition One merely... and they use the word "merely"... removes court-ordered school assignment to cure state-prescribed racial imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.323" offset="16861976">The court says on page 67A, all the amendment does... despite the Solicitor General's suggestion that they never said "all", they never said "only"... all the amendment does is remove from courts this remedy to end racial isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.515" offset="16930834">Nothing could be clearer than that this Court is bound by the authoritative interpretation of the state courts on this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4251.381" offset="17146292">It addresses it and, instead of denying it, it says, no, it embraces the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
