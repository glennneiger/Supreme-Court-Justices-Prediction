            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="77461">The other opinion I have to announce is No. 80-1350, Community Communications versus the City of Boulder, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.228" offset="122287">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.163" offset="146111">Back in 1943, the Court decided a case styled Parker versus Brown which held that a federal -- that the federal antitrust laws did not prohibit a State in the exercise of its sovereign powers from imposing certain anticompetitive restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.255" offset="234405">Respondent, City of Boulder, Colorado is organized as a so-called home rule city under the Colorado Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.975" offset="277350">That Constitution grants Boulder extensive powers of self-government in local and municipal matters, indeed every power theretofore possessed by the state legislature in local and municipal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.649" offset="340044">And pursuant to those powers, Boulder enacted an ordinance purporting to regulate the cable television business.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.466" offset="375257">The ordinance has been challenged as violative of the Sherman antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.811" offset="396677">The question presented is whether Boulder, as a home rule city, enjoys the state action exemption from Sherman Act liability announced in Parker v. Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.570" offset="447668">The District Court of the District of Colorado held that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.953" offset="465223">The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, after noting that the city's regulation of the cable television business was the only control or act of supervision exercised by a state local government, and thus represented the only expression of policy on the subject matter, reversed the District the Court and held that the city's regulation satisfied the criteria for the Parker and Brown exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.548" offset="567623">Well, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.040" offset="581520">We hold that the Parker v. Brown exemption reflects the federalism principle that we are a nation of states, a principle that makes no accommodation or sovereign subdivisions of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.051" offset="649647">As this Court said almost a century ago in the case called United States v. Kagama, all sovereign authority within the geographical limits of the United States resides either with and I quote from that opinion, "The Government of the United States or with the States of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.766" offset="728432">There exist within the broad domain of sovereignty but these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.739" offset="748390">There may be cities, counties, and other organized bodies with limited legislative functions, but they are all derived from, or exist in, subordination to one or the other of these."</text>
            <text syncTime="181.929" offset="805128">Thus, the challenged anticompetitive regulation, if it is such and we don't decide whether it is or not, can enjoy the Parker exemption only if it constitutes the action of the State of Colorado itself in its sovereign capacity and it does not, or if it constitutes municipal action in furtherance or implementation of clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy, and again, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.185" offset="922157">The judgment of the Court of Appeals must therefore be and it is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.157" offset="942010">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice O'Connor, dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.640" offset="971998">Justice White took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
