            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="84.820" offset="494117">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="90.890" offset="518359">Amongst the responsibilities of the Federal Election Commission is that of administering the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.846" offset="558170">That is the Act contained at Chapter 95 of subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code which provides that in the general election a grant of money to the candidates of political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.272" offset="619923">In the 1980 election the grant to the candidates of the major parties was $29.4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.925" offset="650539">The statute provides that that grant goes to the candidate of the party within ten days of his nomination, if he chooses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.781" offset="685961">The statute makes the public funding provision optional for the candidates of all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.304" offset="716054">If they accept the public funding, they agree to expenditure limitations not to exceed the amount of the grant, $29.4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.112" offset="763283">They also agree not to accept private contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.647" offset="781360">The statute has been twice challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.385" offset="796302">The first time it was challenged was in the case of Buckley v. Valeo decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.121" offset="819290">The challenge there was majorly one under the Fifth Amendment, though there was a First Amendment challenge on an analogy to the freedom of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.660" offset="861399">But the major challenge there was that the statute as constructed discriminated, discriminated against minor parties and new parties on the grounds that by providing the amounts of money before the election to the major parties that it unfairly advantaged them against parties which could not obtain that pre-election funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.378" offset="960351">This Court rejected that challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.913" offset="974457">It concluded that the Congressional decision to provide for public financing was one well within its power, its power to legislate to protect elections, decided by this Court in Burroughs v. United States; and that the power over elections was such that this was a valid exercise of Congress' power under the general welfare clause to expend the monies that it raises.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="234.849" stopTime="248.073">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="234.849" offset="1094202">It was also challenged on the grounds that it prohibited expenditures by individual candidates of their own money, and it was struck down in that regard, was it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_nevett_steele" startTime="248.073" stopTime="466.349">
            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="248.073" offset="1147074">Yes, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.442" offset="1152508">This case really involves a third challenge to it, I think, a challenge that was not raised in Buckley; the statute then was identical and was not raised in the second case, which was the Republican National Committee, which was a case that was brought on behalf of the supporters of the Republican candidates in the 1980 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.391" offset="1244354">And the challenge there was a straight First Amendment challenge not similar to the one in Buckley, but that the statute, by requiring the candidates to agree to an expenditure limit, abridged the rights of the candidate's supporters; that the supporters by being closed out in the public financing system had their First Amendment rights abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.923" offset="1342470">This Court, affirming the decisions of a three-judge District Court in the en banc court for the Second Circuit, concluded that there was no such violation of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.231" offset="1395760">As set forth in the court's decisions below, they noted that individuals in the public financing system have substantial opportunities for participating in that system, and listed them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.657" offset="1453438">In effect, this is a third challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.775" offset="1465872">This is a challenge to the First Amendment, another First Amendment challenge, that the supporters of the Republican candidate have their First Amendment rights violated because contributions that they wish to make cannot be translated into independent expenditures by political committees; rather than the challenge in the RNC case which was that their First Amendment rights of supporters were abridged because they could not give to the candidate, and the candidate could not expend those monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.545" offset="1584991">This is a challenge that those supporters' First Amendment rights are violated because they cannot give that money to a political committee which will in turn transform those into expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.435" offset="1628563">The case arose in the following fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.821" offset="1642042">In the early summer of 1980 the three respondents announced plans that they would each raise funds, take contributions, aggregate those funds, take contributions from corporate PACs, take contributions from union PACs, take contributions from other political committees, take contributions from individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.937" offset="1734516">They qualified themselves as multi-candidate committees under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.841" offset="1758130">Those multi-candidate committees are permitted to take contributions of $5,000 under the statute in this Court's decision in Buckley, as opposed to those of other political committees which are limited to $1,000 contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.416" offset="1812465">They announced plans that they were going to raise these monies and expend them on the grounds that they had an unlimited right to make those kind of expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.193" offset="1871606">There was no application as to whether or not the Act applied to those; though I would note that one of the respondents, the Americans for an Effective Presidency, sought and then withdrew for an opinion, an advisory opinion from the Commission as to whether the statute prohibited their activities, indicating that they felt that there was a constitutional problem; but that opinion was withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.410" offset="1980380">Beyond that, none of them applied for what the Act does provide, which is a declaration as to whether the Act prohibits the activities that they were involved--</text>

            <text syncTime="466.349" offset="2020191">Mr. Steele, I gather back in 1976... am I right... the Commission suggested that these were really independent expenditures that probably wouldn't come within to further the election of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.728" offset="2085706">Is that so in, you know, the case of that GOP Feminist Caucus on the buttons for President Ford?</text>

            <text syncTime="489.331" offset="2112142">That was not a Commission decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.500" offset="2120815">That was an informational letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.535" offset="2136906">Well, has the Commission... may I put it this way... interpreted subdivision (f) as inapplicable if they are in fact independent expenditures?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="508.060" offset="2187061">The arguments that I understand the respondents to be making are, first, that the Commission in considering regulations in 1976 after this Court's decision in Buckley, the Commission after its reconstitution in May had hearings during June and July attempting to get regulations in place for the 1976 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.340" offset="2260099">During those hearings there was a substantial portion of those hearings, two days of those hearings, half of two days of those, devoted to the question of 9012(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="535.279" offset="2295939">Respondents argue that the Commission, by not adopting a regulation that repeated the words of the statute, indicated that somehow that the Commission had decided that that was not applicable to independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.437" offset="2352573">I don't see how the nonadoption of the statutory words in a regulation yields that result.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="554.741" offset="2373784">But in any event, your answer to me is the Commission never has in fact constituted the statute as inapplicable to so-called independent expenditures by these--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="563.347" offset="2408161">--And that's your position today, that the statute can't be read that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.417" offset="2428432">With regard to the informational letter that you asked about, as I say, that was an informational letter coming out of the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.904" offset="2458421">I think that there is language in there that is probably... cuts against that position, but I don't think that was an official Commission position.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.593" offset="2489141">And moreover, the requesting party there said right up what it was doing was the so-called button and bows exemption which was enacted in '79... small, less than $1,000, small items.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.668" offset="2541490">And the real question there was there was that--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="598.370" offset="2548282">But I gather the Commission's position is that we can't avoid deciding the constitutional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.257" offset="2575763">As I was saying, I think that one of the respondents here, the Americans for Change, argues to this Court that there is an interpretation of the statute which would allow it to avoid that.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.151" offset="2639397">They did not seek an interpretation before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.920" offset="2650473">The other parties all seem to agree that basically the statute prohibits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.324" offset="2672103">In any event, the activity was undertaken on the grounds of the feelings of the respondents that their constitutional rights allowed them to do that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.597" offset="2713167">In the face of these plans, the Commission, which under the statute in Section 9011(b) of Title 26 is authorized to bring suits to implement or construe provisions of the Fund Act, brought this suit, brought it in the statutorily required three-judge District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.587" offset="2957151">That is a question which has never come in front of the Commission, so that my answer would be, is not something that an interpretation that I think the Commission in any way has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.443" offset="2996543">But it would seem that the terms of the statute are to further the election of a candidate, and that an expenditure to defeat one, even where there are three, would be one that would further the election of anybody but.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.953" offset="3050565">So that I would think that there is an argument under the statute that that certainly is something that would further the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.190" offset="3079508">I would reiterate again that I do not think that that question has been posed to the Commission, either by the facts of this case or in any request for an advisory--</text>

            <text syncTime="742.997" offset="3126738">--Well, I think that under Buckley v. Valeo and numerous other Court decisions of this Court, but Buckley v. Valeo most prominently because it is in the area, that this Court has articulated a balancing standard: that the rights, the First Amendment rights, I think that there are First Amendment rights implicated here, because there is under this Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo, there is the expenditure of money to achieve statements of political ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.565" offset="3237079">But the court below, I think, which found the statute constitutional, in effect said that the balance that Congress here struck in trying to protect individual rights in the public financing scheme was not a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.693" offset="3301549">But I think it very clear, and I hope that our brief which I will try not to go through all of the legislative history, but do not thereby wish to avoid what I think is one of the major thrusts of our brief, which is that Congress considered this statute, considered the problems, including the constitutional problems, and struck a balance that it felt that did what its major purpose was, which was to, under the federal funding statute, which was to create a substitute for private financing, to allow within that, to allow individuals substantial opportunities to continue to participate in the elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.020" offset="3462881">Again, I cited the RNC case where I think there was a long recitation of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.722" offset="3481690">We have set those forth in the ends of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.757" offset="3489840">But there are substantial rights protected by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.042" offset="3503006">It is not considered to be a contribution under the statute for a person to offer their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.780" offset="3525889">It is not considered a contribution under the statute for people travel on behalf of a candidate up to an amount of $2,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.267" offset="3551907">There is an exemption for use of homes, and it's broadened so that it's not merely a personal home but in effect is shelter, and that there are substantial opportunities for individuals to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.674" offset="3601435">Section 9012(f) itself makes very clear, and if it's not clear by the fact that it refers only to political committees, it seems to me it's clear from the legislative history that Congress balanced to allow individuals to make expenditures under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.629" offset="3841343">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.162" offset="3843433">Congress, in enacting the public financing statute, explicitly sought to establish it as an alternate to private financing... not a mandatory alternate but one chosen by the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.157" offset="3915427">In so doing, Congress looked at what it saw as the reality of political life and debated the problem that would arise if having limited that fund, committees were able to be formed to expend unlimited amounts of money and thereby to in effect dwarf the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.773" offset="4017931">For Congress saw, Congress debated... indeed, at pages 22 and 23 of our... 21 and 22 of our brief, going slightly over to 23, is a series of debates in the 1971 history.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.882" offset="4074356">We have earlier referred to the fact of the 1966-67 history which first drafted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.702" offset="4101628">But there were attempts to go both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.952" offset="4110614">There were attempts by some Senators to say if you allow a thousand dollars per committee, you are allowing a substantial loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.724" offset="4145722">You are allowing... there will be committees formed all over the place that will expend money in amounts up to a thousand dollars, and it will substantially undercut the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.347" offset="4180204">There were amendments that sought to reject the idea that individuals could spend money, saying that well, if you allow individuals to spend money, they, too, will undercut the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.804" offset="4222000">There were other attempts to amend the statute to say well, we need to broaden this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.641" offset="4245301">We need to let more come out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.243" offset="4259721">There was substantial talk of the constitutional rights of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.045" offset="4274976">And in effect, the choice that the Congress made... and I think it's clear in that history and clear in the statute... was an attempt to prohibit large, aggregated wealth from dominating over the public fund, while protecting the individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.741" offset="4337775">Turning to the question... the decision of the District Court below, the three-judge District Court below, the court there analyzed this case as basically one that involved only the pooling of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.570" offset="4421053">In effect, they rejected the Congressional assessment of the fact that political committees, particularly large, multi-candidate committees such as these, were very different from individuals who merely pooled funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.664" offset="4485419">In effect, the decision of the court below suggests that as pooling agents these committees directly exercise the First Amendment rights that an individual would be doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.887" offset="4530349">The Congressional judgment was very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.773" offset="4549889">The Congressional judgment was that this was not central to the individual's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.427" offset="4572459">And the question of the statutory test comes forward here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.147" offset="4595342">I would say that under this Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo that the test of a public financing statute such as this is whether it serves a rational basis, and that in that vein that the Congressional decision that in order to protect this fund, in order to have this fund not dwarfed so that a candidate looking out over the whole political scene would not have to think I know that out there there is substantial amounts of money; I must woo that money, if I am going to be successful in my candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.285" offset="4715923">And people can spend, as the three committees here did, approximately $9 million in the course of election, a sum that's roughly one-third of that which the public fund provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.074" offset="4759077">If they look out in future years knowing that in this election there were these three respondents and two other committees that did that, but that there are some 1,200 political action committees of corporations, political action committees of unions that will, if the decision below is upheld, be able to spend that kind of money, any candidate will have to woo that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.506" offset="4852805">He will have to consider that the positions he takes, the arguments he makes will necessarily be swayed by the expenditure of that money; and that is precisely what Congress sought to avoid with the public financing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.433" offset="4908498">For one of the purposes approved by this Court was the ability to free the candidate from having to seek those private funds, put forward this system of public financing as a substitute, not merely as a supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.776" offset="4973908">And indeed, in this Court's decision, the rationale for rejecting the Fifth Amendment challenge, the discriminatory challenge, was precisely that; that the new parties and so forth were not disadvantaged because there was this cap, because there was this substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.154" offset="5043394">They could seek money; they could seek money outside the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.439" offset="5056560">And therefore, though the major parties were given this subsidy, the minor parties were not disadvantaged in the constitutional sense because they were still able to raise the private funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.264" offset="5095848">Let me put a variation of the hypothetical I had put to you earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.699" offset="5113611">Suppose a committee, an independent committee is formed for the stated and publicized purpose of getting out the largest possible, maximum vote, and it is clear in that setting that the maximum, the larger the vote, the large vote will favor one of the candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.862" offset="5194277">Would you say that that would fall in the same way that a committee formed to defeat one candidate because it has an influence on the election?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Nevett Steele</label>
            <text syncTime="1270.587" offset="5237118">I think that though perhaps in reality one might be able to decide that getting out the vote overall might benefit one candidate, I think that that's a decision... to say that that was what Congress meant of furthering the election of one candidate would be astray; in effect, that legally the getting out the vote... and indeed, the statute very explicitly protects get out the vote activity in a number of ways; indeed, it's a question that the Commission has wrestled within the context of whether simple signs saying "Get out the vote", paid for by committees and so forth, are ones that violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.212" offset="5395629">But that in effect that get out the vote, even though one might be able in a political science sense to say that it had indeed advantaged one candidate over the other, was not what Congress was aiming at when it was speaking of furthering the election of a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.972" offset="5450695">The court below spoke in terms of the fact that there was no quid pro quo here; there was no possibility of a quid pro quo between these independent committees and that of the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.981" offset="5510672">Again, it would seem that that judgment is one in which the court below says that, in effect, that the Congress was wrong, because the Congress' judgment, in effect, was first of all that the interest here was for public financing, to protect the public financing; that there did not need to be a quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.693" offset="5585592">Even accepting the argument that a quid pro quo is necessary, that corruption is necessary or the appearance of corruption is necessary, the court below did not really come to grips with the Congressional judgment that if you had large-scale committees like this, you were inevitably in a situation where a candidate needed to pay attention to what those committees brought forth, needed, in effect, to decide that if he did not pay attention to what those committees were advocating, he would not be able to... he would not be as likely to be as successful in his election campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.449" offset="5728534">In effect, Congress' judgment was that the dangers of a quid pro quo that were there were very great, and that in any event that if you have a public financing system set forth by $29.4 million, if the private funding goes well beyond that in the terms that we have set forth in our briefs, that many of the Senators use, that committees will be created to go beyond the authorization of this Act; that if you have a system where the private funding is $60 million or $90 million... that was not true in this election; it was $9 million roughly, as I say, one-third... but that if you have a situation such as that, that you have the public fund being merely a takeoff point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.574" offset="5885059">It is merely a subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.790" offset="5889970">It is a subsidy then to the parties, the major parties or to minor parties who have obtained the five percent in the last election, which would not be for the full $29.4 million but in a ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.798" offset="5929990">But that there is only then a system not of a substitute of public financing, but of a system where public financing is a supplement to private financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.404" offset="5972413">The Congress rejected that idea, rejected that idea in the basic statute, rejected that idea in 9012(f) itself explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.926" offset="6006477">As I say, I do not want to... I certainly don't have the time to go through all the Congressional history again; but I would make once more the point that I think that our brief has set forth, is that this was a very explicit Congressional choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.603" offset="6065200">This was not something that crept up unawares on the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.305" offset="6080037">Congress debated this in '66-'67.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.773" offset="6093830">When the statute came back in '71, it occupied them for a long period of time during those debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.827" offset="6114101">As I say, there were amendments back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.863" offset="6122251">The Congressional choice here was to protect public financing and to prohibit the private financing by political committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.051" offset="6163002">It made a very distinct balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.753" offset="6169794">It does not prohibit it entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.403" offset="6176377">It allowed it up to a thousand dollars for these political committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.122" offset="6187244">Again, these political committees are aggregations of wealth.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1535.975" offset="6298735">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.009" offset="6310855">The issues in this case have extraordinary importance, not only because they implicate the First Amendment but also because the decision will profoundly influence, if not determine for many years in the future the role of aggregated wealth from presidential elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.757" offset="6397791">The central question as we see it here is whether Congress has the power to restrict the aggregation and expenditure of wealth by political committees, by organizations whose primary purpose is to support a candidate for election, where the presidential candidate has agreed to accept public funds in lieu of private financing of his campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.942" offset="6518581">That question, we submit, was not decided in Buckley and Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.430" offset="6540524">That case was concerned with a sweeping ban on all independent expenditures, including expenditures by individuals, by a wide variety of associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.738" offset="6593709">Section 9012(f), on the other hand, restricts only expenditures by political committees; that is to say, by centrally managed organizations whose major purpose is to raise money by widespread solicitation of contributions, and then having aggregated the funds, to promote the election of a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.055" offset="6694960">We submit the restriction does not violate the First Amendment essentially for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.125" offset="6723277">First, it serves the important purpose of preserving the integrity of government and public confidence in the integrity of government against the corrosive effects of private financing in presidential election campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.504" offset="6788792">And second, it leaves wide scope for political speech and expression by individuals and by groups, including various associations other than political committees as I have defined them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.430" offset="6852530">Mr. Cox, what do you do with respect to the Court of Appeals treatment of your standing at pages 28a and page 29a of the jurisdictional statement?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="1686.088" stopTime="1746.989">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1686.088" offset="6899133">We say first that that question need not be faced by this Court, because of the decision in McCulloch against the Society of Honduran Seamen in 372 U.S. 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.865" offset="6970290">There the court had two cases before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.531" offset="6980948">In one of them the plaintiffs' standing and the jurisdiction of the District Court was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.970" offset="7018669">In the other case it was debated, as it would be debated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.291" offset="7039985">And this Court held in the McCulloch case... that was the flags of convenience case that some of you will remember... that it could go to the merits in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.980" offset="7082721">So I think Your Honors do not need to be concerned with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.384" offset="7104351">The case, we submit, of course, should be remanded; and we would think that that would be an issue to be fought out again in the District Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1752.643" offset="7165373">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.626" offset="7169343">Of course, when that question requires decision... and we have covered it in our papers on the jurisdictional statement... when that question requires consideration, then we would be at odds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.219" offset="7231619">But I don't think this Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.688" offset="7245517">If the Court does go into it, it's covered in our papers in the answer to the motion to dismiss or affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.194" offset="7275610">In developing the constitutionality of the statute, I acknowledge, of course, that the restriction in 9012(f) impinges on freedom of speech and freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.405" offset="7348439">But those rights, we submit, as this Court has often held, are not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.975" offset="7378637">There is some room for balancing where the restriction is targeted to protect the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.979" offset="7410715">Again, this faces evil other than some evil supposed to be inherent in the ideas or the information expressed and its effect on the minds of the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.889" offset="7466303">Those two rights you referred to, Mr. Cox, they come about as near, as near to being absolute as any of the First Amendment rights, do they not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1836.994" offset="7502770">The Court has often said that they are subject to qualification if we satisfy the strict scrutiny test, and here we submit that we do satisfy that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.933" offset="7546552">The Fund Act, as I said, was framed and enacted to secure the integrity of government and the confidence of people in the integrity of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.758" offset="7585840">And this Court on previous occasions has recognized that those are sufficient and compelling, sufficiently compelling interests to survive the strict scrutiny test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.780" offset="7629935">Now, developing the compelling purpose, the corrosive effects of private financing of presidential campaigns have, of course, been well documented both in Congress, this Court, and in other writings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.677" offset="7705481">Then Congress determined to eliminate them by an offer to substitute public funding so that the presidential candidate, in the words of Senator Pastore, might take office a free man, might take office neither himself nor his appointees, his administration in any way beholden to those who had put up the money to elect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.862" offset="7830241">The Congress was also aware that to secure that purpose it had to go beyond simply forbidding the acceptance of contributions and the expenditure by the candidate and his authorized committees of more than the amount of the public fund... in the 1980 election, $30 million a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.264" offset="7927835">Congress realized, and as Mr. Steele said, it was explicitly discussed, that there was grave danger of subterfuge, meaning evasion not deceit; that there was grave danger of circumvention simply by friends of the candidate, those who had long been in his party moving out, setting up over here, without consultation, an independent committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.331" offset="8036086">They'd all worked together for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.981" offset="8042669">There'd be no need for any kind of consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.449" offset="8052596">And indeed, history shows that there's very grave danger that that amount of private money might very well swamp the public funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.024" offset="8098885">In addition, we submit, the Congress had ample basis for concluding that the members of political committees who raise contributions and spend money to elect the President, independently as they characterize them, present a threat of actual or apparent undue influence upon the successful candidates in this race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.491" offset="8200762">This really, it's a matter of common sense, I suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.443" offset="8216540">There's not much difference between the position of the man who says I contributed $5,000, $25,000... it couldn't be $25,000 now, but $5,000... to the President's election; I want an appointment with the Assistant Secretary for this or that department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.308" offset="8312044">And the money, as has often been put, serves as a right to get in the door and to get a sympathetic hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.549" offset="8356975">Well, there's not much difference in the case of someone who says I spent, I raised and spent by a political committee $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.674" offset="8405458">I would like a hearing with so and so, and a sympathetic hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.094" offset="8435133">And the effect, of course in some cases there's no effect, and we wish there would never be an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.065" offset="8459061">In other cases one doesn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.934" offset="8474526">The danger was the converse of an expression of Justin Dart that we quote in our brief,</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.872" offset="8506290">"Dialogue with politicians is a fine thing, but with a little money they hear you better. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.099" offset="11611205">The sort of expression that was purchased by these committees include newspaper advertisements, radio and television advertising, letters, flyers, brochures, even bumper strips and buttons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.092" offset="11775149">I would direct the Court's attention to Appendix A, which is a newspaper advertisement that depicts what Americans For Change believe to be the record of President Jimmy Carter on various issues concerning jobs, the budget, inflation, and with the record of Ronald Reagan when he was Governor of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.708" offset="11877654">I don't know where the Appellants wish to draw the line for purposes of the statute that is at issue here, but certainly that same advertisement either in its present form is dealing with issue discussion of those issues that surrounded the campaign in 1980, or perhaps with some deletion of a word here or a word there it would to the satisfaction of Appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.191" offset="11983502">With respect to when an organization becomes a political committee under the Federal Election Campaign Act, we cite to several advisory opinions that have been issued in the course of several years by the Federal Election Commission concerning when a group becomes a political committee for purposes of not only the Federal Election Campaign Act but the Fund Act as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.609" offset="12085275">And in that collection of opinions, which appears on pages 34 and 35 in Footnote 38... this is the brief of Americans For Change... includes a loose association... that is the Commission's phrase... a loose association that in 1980 published a summary of positions by candidates Reagan, Carter and Anderson concerning</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.791" offset="12181928">"key moral and religious liberty issues. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.160" offset="12195407">And that organization was held by the Commission to be a political committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.897" offset="12214424">The types of advertising and communication undertaken by these committees in 1980 were done so without the cooperation or consultation or direction or control of Ronald Reagan or his campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.691" offset="12289552">That is conceded in this case by all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.262" offset="12307838">They are as such independent expenditures, which is not only a statutorily-defined term contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act, but is a concept that was very clearly recognized by this Court in Buckley v. Valeo, and referred to more recently in the California Medical Association case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.378" offset="12400312">These are expenditures for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate which have been undertaken by, in this case, committees without the consultation, direction, or control of the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.172" offset="12475440">We seek affirmance of the unanimous decision of the three-judge court for two basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.612" offset="12509190">First, we believe that there is a construction which is not only proper but one which Congress had in mind when it passed Section 9012(f) ten years ago, which would not make that statute applicable to independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.824" offset="12586095">In the alternative, if the statute is construed, as suggested by the Appellants, to apply to independent expenditures, then it is unconstitutional under the First Amendment for the reasons and principles enunciated by this Court in Buckley v. Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.868" offset="12662268">Mr. Steele indicated that the Federal Election Commission had not come forth with any construction as to what constitutes an expenditure to further the election of a candidate, and in fact, in response to questions from the Court was hardly precise as to what that term means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.734" offset="12753696">Expenditures to further the election of a candidate are the types of expenditures that are limited by Section 9012(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.506" offset="12788805">This action, which is brought under Section 9011(b), I assume seeks to implement and construe this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.528" offset="12828929">Since we are not challenging the constitutionality in the sense of having brought this case before the court below, we were sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.801" offset="12866023">The Appellants are the ones who brought this suit to implement and construe Section 9012(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.074" offset="12895071">9012(f), when it was passed ten years ago, made sense as a limitation on coordinated expenditures by unauthorized committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.762" offset="12937807">It may not make a great deal of sense today because in the intervening ten years we have not only had the Fund Act passed, but also the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, and three subsequent major amendments to both those acts, plus this Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.592" offset="13029131">These campaign financing statutes have gone through tremendous readjustment, upheaval, repeal, sections held unconstitutional by this Court; and the way they exist today are hardly the way that they perhaps were originally envisioned back in 1971, and certainly would not be advance of the model of draftsmanship and clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.576" offset="13133099">But back in 1971 there were no limitations on contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.980" offset="13158699">The general limitations on contributions were not enacted by Congress until 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.459" offset="13228602">That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.727" offset="13237693">The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which is a separate piece of legislation from the Fund Act in which 9012(f) is contained, in its original form contained a limitation on all candidates, not just publicly financed candidates but privately financed candidates for President, House and Senate, and that limitation set a dollar amount as to what expenditures the candidates could make for media communications, the same communications that these committees undertook in 1980... newspaper ads, television and radio advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.721" offset="13401637">And in addition to setting the limitation, the Congress placed in that statute in Title 1 a certification process, all of which is described in considerable detail in the opinion of the Court in ACLU v. Jennings, which is set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.432" offset="13480527">And this certification process required any individual, group or committee to obtain the written permission of the candidate before they would be able to purchase advertising from a broadcaster or from a magazine or publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.977" offset="13550744">So ironically, this formula, this statute, which was considered by the Senate three months before they considered Section 9012(f) and the Fund Act, if it had been able to pass constitutional muster in ACLU v. Jennings and had continued in existence in this original form up to the 1980 election, these committees would not have been able to undertake the advertising and activity that they did without having first gone to Ronald Reagan and getting his permission, because the broadcasters would have denied them the opportunity to purchase that type of advertising, as would have the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.958" offset="13734646">We point out in our brief that it was not the Fund Act or 9012(f) that Congress chose to address in seeking to limit independent expression in campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.884" offset="13798281">Through the history of campaign financing legislation the Congress has consistently utilized the Federal Election Campaign Act as a vehicle by which they in various forms sought to limit independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.275" offset="13851884">The first such effort was the Title 1 provision that I have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.929" offset="13874454">When that was held unconstitutional by the three-judge court in ACLU v. Jennings, in 1974 Congress enacted another limitation of $1,000 on independent expenditures, and that limitation was Section 608(e) that this Court reviewed in Buckley v. Valeo and struck down as unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.746" offset="13981765">After that decision, the Congress essentially threw up its hands and said we cannot limit the genuinely independent activities of individuals or groups or committees as long as they are out there acting on their own and not under the direction or control of the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.980" offset="14082702">And since that time we have had no further attempts by Congress to impose this type of a limitation in any other form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.002" offset="14118751">The legislative history surrounding both the Title 1 provision as well as Section 9012(f) is set forth in great detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.560" offset="14169010">It does not support the contention of Appellants that Congress sought to specifically limit the types of activities that these committees have undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.754" offset="14229823">There is no clarity in either the reports of the Congress or on the floor debates that when 9012(f) was enacted, Congress was thinking about regulating the so-called organized committees that were going to operate independently of the candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3691.225" offset="14919665">The history surrounding Section 9012(f) I will only refer to briefly, but I wish to point out to the Court's attention that Senator Pastore, who is the author of not only 9012(f) but the Fund Act, when confronted with questions on the floor of the Senate as to what would be the effect of the statute with respect to certain committees organized by what he calls faculty members of Columbia University or schoolteachers, he says, you know, they're operating on their own, they're independent, they're able to do whatever they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.468" offset="15088625">And this legislative history, in our opinion, totally repudiates the contention of the Appellants that Congress in enacting 9012(f) was seeking to control the activities of genuinely independent organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.644" offset="15153409">If Section 9012(f) were not construed as a limitation on coordinated expenditures, then the statute becomes unconstitutional as a restriction on First Amendment rights of expression and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.641" offset="15237314">Like Section 608(e) that this Court addressed in Buckley v. Valeo, the restrictions contained here are substantial, direct restrictions on both the quantity and the quality of political expression as undertaken in conjunction with our campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.471" offset="15320697">Both Appellants this morning indicate that the campaign funding act is important because the candidate has made a decision to accept this public funding, and therefore the expenditure limitation that is imposed on the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.385" offset="15396348">This Court recognized in Buckley, and it was so recognized later in the Republican National Committee case, that the overall general expenditure limitation that is voluntarily assumed by the candidate who makes this election is not a restriction on the rights of the candidate's supporters where the supporters remain free to undertake their own independent expression on behalf of that candidate, so long as they do so outside of his campaign or outside of his direction or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.677" offset="15545455">In Buckley the Court noted that a $1,000 limitation in 1975 was insufficient to purchase a one-quarter page ad in the Washington Post newspaper here in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.020" offset="15614836">That figure has doubled in terms of advertising rates by 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.375" offset="15640331">Whatever restriction occurred with respect to the quantity of speech that could be purchased for $1,000, it has doubled, more than doubled in the intervening years since Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.683" offset="15689546">With respect to the quality of advocacy that can be undertaken in light of Section 9012(f) as a restriction on independent expression, the type of limitation that would exist after the statute were construed to limit organized collective political independent expression would mean that there will be only four avenues of expression in conjunction with publicly financed campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.106" offset="15835205">Those avenues would be the campaign, the political parties, the institutional press, and wealthy individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.331" offset="15876060">It is conceded that if Senator Schmitt, who is an appellee in this case, were a rich man and had the resources to go out and purchase exactly the same advertising that these committees undertook in 1980, that that would not only not be reached by Section 9012(f), but that action on the part of the individual is constitutionally protected, as it was recognized by this Court in Buckley v. Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.100" offset="15995179">On the other hand, the committees have attempted to gather together persons of like mind who do not have the unlimited resources that they would be able to exercise statutorily and constitutionally, and in lieu thereof have chosen to pool their resources and to purchase expression and to utilize professional help in terms of formulating their message, and to attempt to persuade the public as to why it should vote for Ronald Reagan in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.558" offset="16148988">And that is the core of the expression that this Court has before it today.</text>

            <text syncTime="4022.757" offset="16245850">The interest that the appellants have advanced in support of this restriction appears to be two: first is the interest of preserving the integrity of the public financing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.468" offset="16324635">As we indicate in our brief and as I just referred to, we don't believe that is the interest that rises to the area of being compelling, and that the statute first of all was never contingent on an overall expenditure limitation; and secondly, the only reason it was sustained in the Republican National Committee case was that these supporters still reserved their right to undertake independent expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.254" offset="16447828">The other interest that has been advanced is the proper interest and concern of Congress to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption with respect to candidates after they become public office-holders.</text>

            <text syncTime="4332.746" offset="17485726">Yes, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.781" offset="17489905">We do not contend that the government does not have a valid interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.970" offset="17526686">We argue that just as in the Buckley case this limit does not serve that interest, and that there are numerous other measures in the existing statutes of the campaign financing laws, some of which were enacted after this Court's decision in Buckley, which more constitutionally and more effectively address the interest that the government had back originally in '71 and in subsequent years to prevent the corruption in campaign financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.358" offset="17664194">The interest at all times has been focused on contribution limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.964" offset="17702646">Senator Pastore referred to it as the situation where there is the "intimate contact" between the contributor and the candidate, which may create the potential for undue influence or some sort of corrupt quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.711" offset="17785611">And as this Court noted in Buckley, when one refers to independent expenditures where an individual or a group is undertaking their advocacy outside of the control of the candidate, such an environment does not arise in the sense that Congress was focusing on it when it was passing these campaign financing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.057" offset="17870979">The interest is served much better by other means than a limit on the expression itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.281" offset="17919881">Some of those measures which have been noted in the past include the disclosure provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.519" offset="17948824">Since the Buckley decision not only have there been the continued disclosure provisions requiring the disclosure of all receipts and all disbursements, but after your decision the Congress enacted in '76 a further requirement that independent expenditures, specifically by these type of committees, have to be separately reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.800" offset="18037954">And the Federal Election Commission has promulgated even separate forms for the reporting of independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.538" offset="18064912">And on top of that, on that particular form the treasurer of the committee has to swear that the expenditure was in fact independent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4487.144" offset="18103365">Well, don't you think the candidate would know of that report and probably accord an audience, if he would accord an audience to someone who contributed directly?</text>

            <text syncTime="4498.432" offset="18148504">We do not dispute, Justice Rehnquist, that the candidate may be aware of effective advocacy that is undertaken on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.092" offset="18199182">The issue that we believe is crucial to the determination of the presence of a compelling interest is whether this candidate has any control over this advocacy in the sense that he would have control over contributions that he receives; and he spends those contributions the way he and his campaign managers believe ought to be spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.971" offset="18278699">And the only way that he can get control over that potentially under the corruption argument is by making some sort of illicit promise in return for the availability of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.944" offset="18318614">But under these circumstances there is no dispute that the committees in their conduct in 1980 on behalf of Ronald Reagan were not under his control.</text>

            <text syncTime="5280.744" offset="21277765">I would like to make, I think, two points: one, with regard to the dangers that expenditures pose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.283" offset="21311933">I think that the suggestion here by the committees is that expenditures do not pose such a danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.539" offset="21340981">I think that the Congress in this statute and in similar statutes outside the Hatch Act and 441(b), which is the prohibitions on corporations and labor organizations, has explicitly made that judgment that expenditures present the same kind of danger as contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.048" offset="21402943">Secondly, I would like to emphasize something that I said earlier, which is with regard to the ability of individuals to engage in activity which is protected by the Act, specifically with regard to the example that Justice Rehnquist proposed of personal services; that the Act in Section 431, the definitional section, the first statement is that a contribution does not include such services.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.282" offset="21511926">In other words, again, the Act in many places has made a balancing between things which would be... certainly are things of value to a campaign and certainly are things that the campaign may be very happy to have, but it's balance that an individual has a right to do that kind of services, again mentioning also in our brief the travel and the housing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5360.648" offset="21597399">Let me have a variation of the hypothetical I gave to your friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.016" offset="21610878">Let's suppose a group of people form a foreign policy committee against Camp David agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.920" offset="21642434">It's perfectly clear that that's identified with one of the candidates, and it may be ambiguous as to the others who may or may not have declared themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.077" offset="21687051">In your view would the Act's, the provisions of the Act, make that a political committee?</text>

            <text syncTime="5389.548" offset="21712965">--It would seem to me that that is an issue committee rather than a political committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.718" offset="21737624">I do not think that the Commission had ruled on that; it has not been asked that specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.087" offset="21755179">It did have a case where the allegation was made that Mobil Oil by making an expenditure putting forth the position on what should happen to the development of oil, that that was not... and in an area where there were two candidacies, were Senate candidates, but I think the principle holds true... that one candidate was in favor of controlling the oil companies and one was not, that that was not violating the prohibitions of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5435.243" offset="21895717">But I was saying that in terms of places where I think the Commission has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.528" offset="21908883">I would think that where you do not have the connection of an issue to a vote explicitly that that is right at the borderline.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.348" offset="21940230">I would say that where a committee is speaking only to issues and is not making the connection over the candidates, I would think that was not necessarily a political committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.572" offset="21981086">And I would think more prominently for purposes of 9012(f) that you would not have a file... you have the knowing and willfully furthering the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.976" offset="22014731">So you would have to say that by coming out on an issue that the committee was knowingly and willfully attempting to further the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.998" offset="22046810">And I would think that, therefore, there would be another element that would say that that expenditure--</text>

            <text syncTime="5476.616" offset="22061229">But if the Commission, hypothetically, decided to proceed on that on the assumption that this was a willful act, would you not have very grave First Amendment problems with respect to these people trying to express their views about a foreign policy matter?</text>

            <text syncTime="5513.123" offset="22207306">If the Commission were to have to make that kind of determination, what Professor Cox referred to as looking to see whether the intent was to further the election, you get into a very difficult area.</text>
