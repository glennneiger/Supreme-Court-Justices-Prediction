            <label>Mr. David B. Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="48.497" offset="331791">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Oregon Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.587" offset="364183">That Court reversed defendant's theft conviction despite the fact that defendant's earlier trial was terminated by defendant's own successful mistrial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.808" offset="405038">The Oregon Court of Appeals held that reprosecution itself was barred because of jeopardy grounds due to the events preceding defendant's successful mistrial motion in the aborted trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.433" offset="451536">At issue in this case is whether a convicted thief ought to be able to escape the occasion of that conviction through the consequence of his own deliberate trial strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.158" offset="498452">The relevant facts, we believe, are few and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.860" offset="513290">Early in defendant's first trial, the prosecution asked an admittedly improper seven-word question.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.382" offset="543383">Before the witness answered, defense counsel objected, moved for a mistrial, and asked that the matter be reset for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.321" offset="579118">The trial court granted defendant's motion over the strenuous objection of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.708" offset="600643">Prior to his retrial, defendant then asked a different judge to dismiss the case on double jeopardy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.712" offset="628647">The trial court declined to do so after making explicit findings that the prosecutor's conduct was not intentional, that the question was not asked in bad faith, and that it was not grossly negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.703" offset="680578">The Oregon Court of Appeals, however, reversed defendant's subsequent conviction, finding that there was nonetheless a Fifth Amendment jeopardy bar because the prosecutor's question constituted something, to wit, called overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="740033">The proposition we would put to this Court is simple, and that is that a defendant who elects to move for a mistrial cannot raise a jeopardy bar to his retrial except in one narrow circumstance, and that is where the prosecutor's conduct itself is intended to provoke that very mistrial, and we note at the outset the anomaly that under the settled law of this Court, had defendant merely objected to the question, been convicted, and then secured successful reversal upon appeal, he could be retried.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.423" offset="895514">So, the issue is whether the defendant, by himself, shortcircuiting the trial process in a full trial on the merits, can be allowed to achieve a different result because his well-taken mistrial motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.766" offset="952878">We contend that the defendant cannot create these anomalous results and cannot complain except in the narrow circumstance where the prosecutor intends that the trial not be completed, and where the prosecutor's conduct was intended to provoke that very mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.143" offset="1022364">We believe that our proposed test would assist both the public and criminal defendants, and we believe that to affirm this case would do grave injury to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.450" offset="1067608">An affirmance would clog court calendars.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.902" offset="1081401">It would multiply appeals about the precise degree of prosecutorial misconduct or error which should lead under a blameworthiness standard of some kind to a double jeopardy finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.543" offset="1128003">It would also, we believe, deter trial judges from granting mistrials in cases where they are appropriate, because they would know for certain that the defendant would go scot free.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.451" offset="1175651">Under those circumstances, the delay, the time, the anxiety, the multiplication of appeals, and the cost to the public of hearing clearly meritorious appeals would be, we think, a prohibitively high cost for such a different rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.862" offset="1237300">We believe that the rule for which we argue is compelled by an understanding of the history and purposes of the double jeopardy clause, that it is implicit, at least, in the dicta and holdings of prior decisions of this Court that a Draconian sanction of barring retrial altogether when the prosecution makes an error ignores the fact that there exist equally effective sanctions against prosecutorial misconduct, and that as a matter of policy the ease and certainty of application of our rule make it a justifiable and appropriate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.783" offset="1376898">We note at the outset, of course, that one of the pieces of the history and purpose of the double jeopardy clause is to prevent against repeated harassment of a defendant by the prosecution when the prosecution suddenly realized that the case is going badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.895" offset="1445339">In that sense, this Court has spoken of the defendant's valued right to decision by a first tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.482" offset="1471775">On the other hand, we can find no decision of this Court which has ever found that the double jeopardy bar applies where a mistrial motion on behalf of the defendant is granted at the defendant's request, and that, we believe is for a good reason, and that is because, as this Court has explicitly recognized, in Lee and in other cases, a mistrial declaration, when it is properly made, serves the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.537" offset="1599984">It is a deliberate election on the part of the defendant to avoid a jury verdict which it is his right to achieve, and to challenge whatever error there may be in the record on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.197" offset="1654632">At the same time, that very mistrial motion ordinarily acts as sufficient and complete punishment for whatever prosecutorial error or unfair advantage there might have been, and of course, this Court has also recognized that there is and must be balanced against whatever right there is to a first tribunal, or policy there is in favor of a first tribunal, an important social interest in the completion of criminal proceedings against a defendant once and for all, a rationale which was re-emphasized as recently as the decision of this Court in United States versus Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.703" offset="1796634">We think the policies that lie behind this and behind this Court's earlier dicta on the question make an enormous amount of sense, because ordinarily mistrial is itself a very significant sanction against the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.895" offset="1857342">It is very easy, I think, to envision the displeasure of the prosecutor's supervisor and the public at the expense of a new trial, let alone the fact that a new trial probably for the prosecution will be more difficult to carry through.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.989" offset="1917737">However, the limited exception to the rule, which we believe is implicit in this Court's dicta, at least, is that if the prosecutor wishes that very sanction in this trial to be imposed, then of course it loses its character as a sanction for misconduct, and under those circumstances, a more serious sanction would be called for, because if it is not, then the consequence is the deliberate harassment of the defendant within the central meaning of the double jeopardy clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.412" offset="2059425">In this case, of course, none of the factors that would call forth that rule exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.568" offset="2088056">We have already noted that under the facts, the error of the prosecutor occurred early in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.655" offset="2112402">Two perfunctory witnesses were heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.888" offset="2121388">The third had testified not to essential elements of the defendant's guilt or innocence, but was merely testifying as to the value of the rug that was in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.953" offset="2213652">I am simply saying that the witness was not testifying directly to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, which is one of the points which earlier decisions of this Court, I believe, place special emphasis upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.597" offset="2264225">The point is that the trial judge did make findings, Justice Marshal, precisely with respect to the nature of the conduct in which the prosecutor had engaged.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.451" offset="2403615">What would be your view of the case if the same trial judge, the judge who was conducting the trial had conducted the hearing on the double jeopardy issue, and you had exactly the same record at the original trial, and the same testimony, and the judge said, well, my impression is that the case was going badly for the prosecutor, and so the prosecutor took a few chances, and was trying to... hoping to get a better result, so although there was not a subjective intent to provoke a mistrial, it is tantamount to that, and therefore I will find that it was the equivalent of an intent to cause a mistrial, and that is unfair to the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="600.841" offset="2541123">Would that be a different case?</text>

            <text syncTime="603.959" offset="2553662">It would go mainly to the issue of who evaluates the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.513" offset="2571843">It is our view that this rule should give appropriate deference to the trial judge's finding, whether it is a different judge who evaluates the first conduct or the one who was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.236" offset="2614789">In the example that you posit, it seems perfectly appropriate that the judge who was even closer to the actual conduct of the criminal trial and therefore who might be able to judge and know of his own observation of the nuances of defendant's and prosecutor's demeanor might be an even better place to make such a decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.591" offset="4604170">Mr. Chief Justice, and say it please the Court, the United States agrees with the state of Oregon that the double jeopardy clause does not prevent retrial of the defendant after a mistrial is declared at his request or with his consent, provided only that the prosecution did not deliberately provoke the mistrial request or the defendant's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.212" offset="4726632">In the federal system, most of the courts of appeals now adhere to that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.780" offset="4748888">However, some have held or stated that reprosecution may be barred where the mistrial request is caused by prosecutorial overreaching or gross negligence or bad faith or intentional misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.957" offset="4805626">In the brief time allotted to me this morning, I will attempt to show that none of these alternative standards is workable, and that all would produce highly undesirable practical consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.347" offset="4855154">First, all these terms are simply too vague to provide any real guidance to courts or litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.187" offset="4882531">Overreaching, for example, is simply a conclusory term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.822" offset="4901130">It means conduct that reaches or goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.191" offset="4914609">It is not a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.791" offset="4920983">Since it means conduct that reaches or goes too far, virtually all prosecutorial or judicial error that causes a mistrial would appear to constitute overreaching, because by definition it is conduct that went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.836" offset="4989110">It caused the mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.269" offset="4994857">Gross negligence is an equally vague standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.139" offset="5010322">This Court's decision in Lee in 1977 stands for the proposition that simple negligence on the part of a prosecutor or a judge is not sufficient to bar retrial, and no one has ever adequately explained the distinction between gross negligence and simple negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.434" offset="5083569">In the field of torts from which that term was borrowed, the concept has now been generally repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.205" offset="5110632">The terms bad faith and intentional misconduct have similar flaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.942" offset="5133620">Apparently these terms refer to any conduct that is not inadvertent, and that the prosecutor or judge knows is wrong or improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.467" offset="6207670">It will also lead them to be more inclined than they are at present to permit the completion of tainted proceedings, knowing that a reversal on appeal would not bar reprosecution, and that would result in more appellate reversals, needless appellate litigation, and many wasted days of trial while tainted proceedings are permitted to run their course.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.992" offset="7081727">On the prosecuting witness, the defense counsel of the trial had shown certain bias on the prosecuting witness, and then on redirect the deputy district attorney tried to rehabilitate the state witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.603" offset="7152258">The attorney... Mr. Attorney General stated that the deputy DA was goaded into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.543" offset="7184023">Now, there was a recess the day of the trial, so the deputy district attorney had all evening, and the testimony is that she met the witness in the hall and discussed it, found out... it came out in the facts of the case that the prosecuting witness did not know the defendant, had never done business with him, and they like to go over the fact that it was a seven-word question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.893" offset="7301365">It was a commenting statement more than a question, and then it goes more to an objection as to the proprieties of a question on hearsay or the fact that the question could have been asked another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.320" offset="7359043">She knew that she had no basic testimony to extract from the prosecuting witness, and went ahead anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.678" offset="7396555">So, I think that it is more than a technical breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.313" offset="7411079">The district attorney should be able to go maybe a lifetime without making such, I think, an overreaching and flagrant statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.817" offset="7441068">Now, one thing, too, that should be pointed out, that when this happened, the trial judge did not even seek argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.455" offset="7483595">He said, granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.638" offset="7488402">So, I mean, I think we have to take in the circumstances, the surrounding circumstances more than just the written word that was taken down in the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.344" offset="7527167">There was no question, and then where the trial judge says, well, you went over the line, it was overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.398" offset="7551409">One other thing that I think is important to know here is the history of the decision by the court of appeals, Judge Gillette.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.686" offset="7588503">Judge Gillette had this case before him, and before that was the Rathbun case, which is cited in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.559" offset="7624029">The Rathbun case was the misconduct on the part of the bailiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.179" offset="7642524">When that case came up, Judge Gillette is the one that heard that case in the court of appeals and held that it was more like jury bias rather than overreaching or that sort of thing, and so he overruled the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.908" offset="7717443">That went up to the Oregon Supreme Court, and the Oregon Supreme Court overruled Judge Gillette.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.744" offset="7744820">So, when Judge Gillette in the Oregon Court of Appeals then has the Kennedy case, he has the latest decision in Oregon stating that a bailiff's misconduct, and that is the rationale of the case, where... is abhorrent, is the case that was used in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.790" offset="7816918">So, if the rationale and the bailiff's subjective intent was not important, so Judge Gillette had that precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.848" offset="7865192">So he followed that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.404" offset="8111474">The only case that is really in point is State versus Rathbun, and the Oregon rule is that an officer of the court, a bailiff, misconduct that goes to that point where it did is flagrant and is overreaching.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.734" offset="13512761">In Dinitz, if it had been the prosecutor who had made those contemptuous remarks in the opening statement, and then was admonished by the trial judge, and he went on, and the trial judge finds that on those set of circumstances there was deliberate intent, I think definitely it would be under the rule that would be a bar to retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.366" offset="13611295">But getting back to, I think, the... so in substance I still think that the Oregon court is not out of line with Jorn or Dinitz, but getting back, I think, to a very fundamental proposition on the case being... or this case should be disposed of, first, that... I don't think you can ignore a court in State versus Rathbun and its opinion, and certainly what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.622" offset="13752251">It isn't meaningless, and you can't find... and that case is on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.574" offset="13768134">But even if it is ambiguous, then we reverse and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.793" offset="13780986">But on the cases that... and this Court has... in Herb versus Pitcairn and other cases, I think that the Oregon court certainly, if it went back to the Oregon court, I think Judge Gillette would end up with the same decision, and then if it went to the Oregon Supreme Court, the Oregon Supreme Court is going to follow the rule of State versus Rathbun, and follow Justice Lindy's statements and policy that we first look to our own, and we cited the Oregon constitution in our briefs originally in the appellate... in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.870" offset="13945244">So, I think that Kennedy is entitled to due process, which includes an analysis of the Oregon law, first by the Oregon court in that sequence.</text>

            <label>Mr. David B. Frohnmayer</label>
            <text syncTime="3475.919" offset="14041479">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.457" offset="14059660">First of all, in my colloquy with you, Justice Marshal, the term "overreaching" arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.760" offset="14080872">The origin and pedigree, of course, of that term comes from a dictum in the Jorn decision by this Court which was construed in aberrant ways by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.632" offset="14120369">So it's clear from the very use of that term by Judge Gillette in the court of appeals in Oregon that in fact he was referring to a line of aberrant federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.840" offset="14161120">That leads us to the second point, which is really a combination of questions and concerns raised by Justice Stevens and Justice Rehnquist, concerning intent, various kinds of epithets used to characterize the prosecutor's misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.432" offset="14215559">What is at issue is the importance of giving a predicate to those particular epithets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.335" offset="14239174">That is, not misconduct in the abstract, but misconduct which is deliberately designed to accomplish something, i.e., aborting the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.591" offset="14272193">That seems to be, to us, the critical question, and the one on which this Court's decision--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3538.995" offset="14293822">Of course, if that is the test, and if we make it the test, every prosecutor presumably would know that, and therefore every time a prosecutor intended to abort the trial in that way, he would also intend to acquit the defendant, because that would be as a matter of law the consequence that would follow, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.940" offset="14361531">So it has to be an intent to acquit in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.509" offset="14383892">Perhaps he would also intend not to be discovered doing it, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.544" offset="14396013">I see, so it would have to be a secret intent by definition, because if he did it overtly, he would be acquitting the man.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.466" offset="14423703">So you have to presume the situation in which the prosecutor is prepared to testify falsely that this was not his real intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.203" offset="14446586">No, I don't think so, and that really raises another point, and that is that there is a strong analogy to the rule that we are advancing in this case in the pre-indictment delay cases and discriminatory prosecution cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.578" offset="14492144">This type of inquiry is not unknown to this Court or to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.796" offset="14508967">It is perfectly appropriate by circumstantial evidence indeed in a criminal trial by circumstantial evidence and inference to conclude what the intent was of a defendant who never took the stand in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.038" offset="14557972">So, I don't think that it's quite the paradox or the dilemma or the difficulty for a trial court making those findings as might appear at first blush.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3613.959" offset="14593603">No, but the ultimate inquiry is, what did he really intend to accomplish, and if he really did intend to accomplish a deliberate mistrial, and if he presumably knows the law, he then was intending to accomplish an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.601" offset="14636235">It is a very strange combination of circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.803" offset="14648983">But one has to bear in mind that this is at best a very narrow exception to a general rule that the issue ought not ordinarily to be before the court at all, because by choosing to move for the mistrial, the defendant normally is electing not to go to the first jury at all.</text>
