            <text syncTime="51.605" offset="350175">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on certiorari to the Fourth Circuit and presents two issues of employment discrimination law.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.818" offset="395001">The first issue is whether an employer's potential back pay liability to a discrimination claimant continues to accrue after the claimant has rejected the employer's unconditional job offer of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.891" offset="455292">The second issue is whether Ford was improperly required to prove its explanation for its employment decisions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.356" offset="489147">The resolution of the back pay issue may well affect the handling of almost any employment discrimination case in which an employer finds itself able to offer employment to a discrimination claimant before the determination of the merits of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.506" offset="557797">The facts essential to the resolution of this issue may be stated briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.191" offset="572530">On July 21, 1971, Judy Judy Gaddis and Rebecca Starr applied to work at the Ford Motor Company's parts warehouse in Charlotte, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.500" offset="609728">Both had recently been laid off from General Motors warehouse, where each had worked for some ten months.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.170" offset="636477">Neither was hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.558" offset="645986">Ms. Gaddis then wrote the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and charged that Ford had not hired Ms. Starr or her because they were women.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.554" offset="681930">Neither Ms. Gaddis nor Ms. Starr resumed regular employment again until January of 1973, although Ford did employ both women in its parts warehouse for some six weeks in late 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.502" offset="741803">In July of 1973, seven months after the women had returned to work at General Motors, Ford had a vacancy for a permanent warehouse job, the same job for which Ms. Gaddis and Ms. Starr had initially applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.059" offset="803975">That vacancy was the first Ford had had for a permanent position since Ms. Gaddis had charged Ford with employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.601" offset="842113">Ford offered the position first to Ms. Gaddis, and she declined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.257" offset="856742">Ford then offered the position to Ms. Starr.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.849" offset="867191">She declined it.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.857" offset="947230">Neither of Ford's offers included seniority or back pay, nor did either offer require Ms. Gaddis or Ms. Starr to abandon any aspect of their discrimination claims against Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.647" offset="1010342">Two years later, in July of 1975, the Commission brought this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.317" offset="1029046">The district court concluded that Ford had discriminated against Gaddis and Starr when it did not hire them in 1971, and also concluded that Ford's offers in 1973 had no effect on the amount of back pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.289" offset="1772908">The offers occurred first to Ms. Gaddis, who declined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.225" offset="1784611">Then it was offered to Ms. Starr, and she declined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.645" offset="1798299">That is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.412" offset="1801434">The district court held Ford's liability to Gaddis and Starr with allowances for interim earnings extended to the end of 1977, the date the Court entered its findings in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.951" offset="1855560">Over a dissent, the Fourth Circuit affirmed its conclusion rejecting Ford's contention that its unconditional offers of employment cut off the accrual of back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.449" offset="1893594">Ford submits that the Fourth Circuit's holding should be reversed, first because it is unfair to employers, to incumbent employees, and to claimants, second, because it is unworkable for the Title VII process, and third, because there is a rule available that is better in all respects, and that is the rule followed by the National Labor Relations Board and the circuit courts reviewing the Board's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.046" offset="2003935">The Fourth Circuit's holding means that an employer charged with employment discrimination can be assured that a job offer will stop the accrual of back pay liability only by offering not only the job initially sought, but also retroactive seniority, and as the court of appeals' reasoning indicates, back pay as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.257" offset="2088781">Thus, to shut off the back pay meter, the employer must offer the claimant essentially all relief that the claimant could be awarded should he or she ultimately prevail at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.564" offset="2137996">The practical effect of this holding is to require that employers give up any meaningful right to contest and defend against the claimant's allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.576" offset="2182090">The Fourth Circuit's rule is also unfair to incumbent employees, because job offers that comply with the Fourth Circuit's rule will undermine their seniority rights, although these employees are third parties totally removed from the discrimination controversy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1282.842" offset="5275093">You earned it after 90 days, and if you did work 90 days or more, then your seniority started from the first day you started work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.651" offset="6086352">Ford was therefore convicted, so to speak, on the force of the prima facie case, and was denied the effect of a rebuttal it should have had.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.824" offset="6227099">To explain why it did not hire these claimants, Gaddis and Starr, Ford introduced evidence that for legitimate and non-discriminatory reasons Ford had not actually reached their applications in the course of the review conducted by the warehouse manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.707" offset="6298570">He did not after he identified two male applicants proceed to later filed applications, and thus had no occasion to make any comparison of the males' applications with these later filed claimants' applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.277" offset="6988830">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I will first address the back pay issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.681" offset="7014430">We are willing to assume arguendo that the NLRA principle governs this case, although we don't think that conclusion is obvious, but there is no support, either in the law developed under the Labor Act or in the logic of the Labor Act principle for holding that the July, 1973, offer to Gaddis and Starr cut off their back pay awards at that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.593" offset="7114113">The best way to understand what that principle is and why those offers did not cut off the back pay awards is to understand the rationale of the Labor Act principle, and that straightforward rationale is that if an employer can ensure that after a certain date an employee will suffer no further effects from an alleged discriminatory act, then the employer should not continue to accrue liability after that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.954" offset="7243576">In other words, if the July, 1973, offer had placed Gaddis and Starr in such a position that after that date they would not continue to suffer the effects of the Petitioner's discriminatory refusal to hire them, then under the Labor Act principle Petitioner would not continue to accrue back pay liability, but the July, 1973, offer to Gaddis and Starr was not sufficient to prevent further injury to them because that offer left them at a continuing seniority disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.691" offset="7394564">They were at a two-year seniority disadvantage that was entirely the result of Petitioner's refusal to hire them in 1971.</text>
