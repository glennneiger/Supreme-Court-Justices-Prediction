            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="118123">We will hear arguments next in McElroy against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.802" offset="141320">Mr. White, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="52.599" offset="328461">Chief Justice Burger, may it please the Court, this case involves the question of statutory construction of the third paragraph of Section 2314.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.740" offset="377049">That statute provides in its pertinent part</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="402440">"Whoever with unlawful or fraudulent intent transports in interstate or foreign commerce any falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited securities, knowing the same to have been falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years or both. "</text>
            <text syncTime="95.045" offset="498257">It is the petitioner's position here that in order for the United States to sustain a valid conviction under this section of the statute, and under this particular paragraph, it is necessary that they prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the check or checks that were here involved in this case be in a forged or altered condition prior to their interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.647" offset="624690">If I may briefly state the facts, the petitioner here was indicted on a three-count indict, one count charging him with violation of the Dyer Act, the other two counts charging him with violation of this subsection of 2314.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.644" offset="700654">The facts as developed at the trial were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.262" offset="719148">Early in 1977, a robbery occurred at the union office in Youngstown, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.802" offset="757287">Some blank checks were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.154" offset="762721">The union notified the bank on which the checks were drawn, and the account was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.491" offset="792082">Approximately 17 months later, the petitioner visited an automobile agency in Pittsburgh, Don Allen's Chevrolet, and negotiated the price of a used Corvette.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.834" offset="853418">After arriving at the price, he told the man, the salesman that he would be back the next day, that he lived in Ohio, that he had to get a check from his credit union.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.760" offset="913081">He also told him that he worked in the Pittsburgh area for a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.728" offset="928964">The next day he appeared with one of the checks that had been stolen at the union office in Youngstown, and it was... when he presented it, it was altered and forged.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.972" offset="985911">The dealership took possession of the check, and he took possession of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.459" offset="1011929">The car was never found again.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="224.876" offset="1017571">You say, when he presented it, it was altered and forged.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.529" offset="1036170">Do you mean by that that the forgery and alteration had taken place prior to the presentation?</text>

            <text syncTime="239.051" offset="1074309">That occurred, of course, in Pittsburgh.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.026" offset="1122165">--Well, that is the question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.978" offset="1130002">We believe that there is a presumption that works here, that when a check is presented that is a forgery, that there is a presumption that it was forged where it first appeared.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.519" offset="1188099">Your Honor, that is a presumption that goes back to 1822, Justice Storey, and it has been utilized by the lower federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.926" offset="1229790">One of the courts that utilized it was one of the courts of which... which would cause the split here among the circuits, Owens versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.215" offset="1270959">The Fifth Circuit relied on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.936" offset="1293842">Yes, Your Honor, he was, and it was used in that case to establish venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.840" offset="1317457">The second incident occurred at Rini Boat Sales in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.244" offset="1350998">Again the petitioner appeared, negotiated the price of a boat with a trailer to haul it away, and after having agreed on the price, he told them that he lived in Ohio, and that he had to get a check from his credit union.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.573" offset="1428321">About a week later he telephoned them, told them that he had the funds, and that he would be there some time during that day, but he had to work overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.279" offset="1467191">About a few hours later he called and told them he was on the Ohio Turnpike, at a rest stop, and he would be there shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.321" offset="1507315">Approximately 20 minutes later, an employee of Rini Boat Sales was standing in front of the agency, when he saw the petitioner pull out of a dead end street in a pickup truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.263" offset="1571158">What followed then was just what happened at the Chevrolet agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.298" offset="1591220">The dealer took possession of a check that was in a forged and altered condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.000" offset="1610028">It was one of the checks that had been stolen at the union office in Youngstown 17 months previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.106" offset="1638450">And thereafter, the boat and the trailer were taken by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.241" offset="1659034">The boat was found about a year later in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.943" offset="1669796">At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds that there was no evidence to support the Dyer Act count because there was no evidence to show that the Corvette had been taken from Pennsylvania to Ohio, and on the check charges, there was insufficient evidence because the government had failed to prove as required by this paragraph of the statute that the checks were in a forged or altered condition prior to their interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.468" offset="1815978">The judge denied both the motions, and charged the jury in accordance with the points for charge presented by the government that it was not necessary that the checks be in a forged or altered condition so long as they could show or the jury found that the checks were moving in interstate commerce in a forged or altered condition solely in the destination state.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.653" offset="1936663">Now, the defendant petitioner here was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.307" offset="1963308">He received a five-year sentence on the Dyer Act count and seven-year sentences on the check counts, all the sentences to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.199" offset="2006881">On appeal to the Third Circuit, they said that there was insufficient evidence to convict on the Dyer Act count, because the indictment charged him with taking the automobile from Ohio... sorry, from Pennsylvania into Ohio, and there was no evidence that the automobile ever went into Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.278" offset="2095174">But on the check charges, they said that the judge's charge was correct, and they held chat it was not necessary under this statute for the government to prove that the checks were in a forged or altered condition prior to their interstate transportation and prior to crossing state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.394" offset="2187648">When they so held that, they held directly in conflict with the Tenth, Eight, and Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeals, which have held with regard to this paragraph of 2314 that it is clear and obvious from a reading of this statute, because of the tenses used and so forth, that this statute means that the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.514" offset="4772099">Now, I will admit that the definition that I told you that Congress had implanted into the Act was taken out by the general code revisions in 1949, and was replaced by Section 10, but the drafters of those sections, and when they revised 2314 and 2315, noted that there was no change in substance, there was merely changes in minor phraseology, and therefore that leaves us with the same intent and the same expression of Congress's will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.140" offset="4930610">Furthermore, the Act has been amended several times to provide for the same prohibitions with tax stamps and forged countersignatures on traveler's checks, and in several other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.482" offset="4992050">Nobody has ever bothered to change the definition or make it clearer or anything, and furthermore, when they put in... when Congress wants to show in 2314 what it is that they want to cover, in the third paragraph it reads... I am sorry, in the second paragraph,</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.015" offset="5086090">"Whoever having devised or intended to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud or the obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.655" offset="5132693">They can speak in language of intent now and intent later, not in the third paragraph of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.976" offset="5166025">It is to my mind clear and unambiguous, and three circuits have so found, and that basically is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.534" offset="5212210">We would cite the Court, of course, to your case of United States versus Barrett, where Justice Blackmun said that where Congress has utilized verb tenses and subrogated them throughout the entire Act, and seemed to know what they were doing when they did it, then we will give full weight and be influenced by that to a great degree, and in this case I think that is exactly what we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.707" offset="5348882">If there is an ambiguity, then that should be resolved in favor of the petitioner, because Congress's will has certainly not been unerringly clear in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.300" offset="5411263">Otherwise, we wouldn't have these three circuits' courts of appeals, and one was an en banc decision reading this statute so clearly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1466.659" offset="5984703">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari limited to the issue of the proper scope of the interstate commerce requirement in Section 2314 of Title XVIII of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.751" offset="6037052">Specifically, the issue is whether in a prosecution for transporting a forged security in interstate commerce, the government must prove that the security in question was forged prior to the time the security reached its destination state or whether instead the government need only prove that a security was transported between one or more... between two or more states, and that prior to the time it reached its ultimate destination, that security was in a forged condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.437" offset="6151782">Petitioner has adequately stated the facts, and I think it is abundantly clear from those facts that what is at issue here is the transportation of a security from Ohio to Pennsylvania, and the only question that is open is when was the forgery, and there is essentially no evidence in the record as to when the actual signature was placed on the specific security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.618" offset="6244569">The district court instructed the jury that if you believe that the government has shown that the defendant transported the checks while they were in a forged condition within the state of Pennsylvania, the requirements of the law are satisfied if that transportation was part of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.396" offset="6311651">That was the instruction offered by the government, and it was over the objection of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.466" offset="6335893">The jury convicted on that instruction, and so there is no dispute that what we are talking about here is a conviction on the basis of the third paragraph of Section 2314.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.672" offset="6372778">The Third Circuit affirmed the conviction on Section 2314, and it did so en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.511" offset="6404125">Nine of the ten judges on the Third Circuit adopted the theory of the government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.130" offset="6422619">The concurring opinion by Judge Adams... or, excuse me, the dissenting and concurring opinion by Judge Adams dissented solely from the reversal of the conviction on the Dyer Act count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.640" offset="6476641">Judge Garth in his dissenting opinion agreed with the theory of the government's case but disagreed with the proof showing that the security in question had been transported from Ohio to Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.899" offset="6529617">And finally, only Judge Higginbotham dissented basically relying on the decisions of the three other courts of appeals that have held similar to the way that petitioner argues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.188" offset="6570786">Frankly, from the government's perspective it is fairly unusual for three courts of appeals to interpret the same provision in a way that we believe is so fundamentally wrong, and so it seems appropriate to begin our analysis by attempting to explain how three courts of appeals have gone off on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.265" offset="6635152">Petitioner in his submission has relied heavily on the presence of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.668" offset="6660752">The source of the law in this area begins in 1961 in United States versus Castle, a case in which the fortuity of events, which was primarily a confession on the part of a defendant that he had forged documents in Maryland and then transported those securities into Texas, was relied upon by the court quite properly as stating each of the elements of a conviction under Paragraph 3 of Section 2314.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.485" offset="6768063">That factual oddity was suddenly transformed into an element of the defense indicta, frankly, by the same court of appeals, the Fifth Circuit, in United States versus Owens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.126" offset="6814561">In Owens, the evidence simply proved that the defendant had attempted to cash securities that could be linked back eventually to New Jersey, the securities having been cashed in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.684" offset="6864820">Unfortunately for the government, there was no proof really as to how the securities had reached Louisiana, nor even how the defendant in that case had come by... had obtained those securities, and therefore there was no real proof of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.793" offset="6929290">The court threw out the conviction on the basis that there was inadequate evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.245" offset="6943083">Unfortunately indeed for the government, in doing so, the court also said that the important element that was missing was the failure to prove the fraud at the time of the interstate passage, moving away from the interstate commerce language, which is the linchpin of the government's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.642" offset="7020614">That language in the opinion of the Fifth Circuit was used by the Eighth Circuit in a subsequent decision involving a Section 2255 review of a guilty plea under Section 2314 where the defendant in that case had plead to having transported securities from one state to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.519" offset="7096161">The court found that there had been no proof that those checks had been forged in the state of origin and then transported, thereby truly effectuating the final development of the rule that petitioner seeks to have adopted by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.331" offset="7171393">That decision then was followed in turn by the Tenth Circuit en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.949" offset="7185917">The decision in Sparrow, I submit, reflects nothing more than the desire of the Tenth Circuit to avoid a conflict among the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.603" offset="7216533">It essentially recites the prior decisions in this area and does little more than cite the rule of Lenity as a basis for its ultimate decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.049" offset="8358293">And I suppose that is why we take the position we do here, which is that we simply cannot prove when the defendant forges the check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.653" offset="8384729">There are few events that are more a secret than the timing of a forgery, and that is why we think that in this situation we have proved out all that is required under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.043" offset="8426211">As I suggest, it seems to me that the Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, although they have in fact reached results contrary to the ones we assert in this case, supply petitioner with very little assistance in this case, because those decisions are not based on the sort of building blocks of statutory interpretation one would expect to be used, that is, the specific language used in the statute, the legislative history behind the statute, and the relationship of this provision to other comparable provisions in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.445" offset="8531850">We reject, I think quite easily, the argument of petitioner that there is a clear meaning to this statute that precludes this prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.717" offset="8568944">Petitioner's clear meaning from the statute is derived solely from the notion that would only make sense in the context of this statute precluded the transportation across a state line of a security, but that is not what this statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.393" offset="8627667">Instead, it forbids transportation in interstate commerce, and the only way to know what transportation in interstate commerce violates the statute can be decided by reference to the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.749" offset="8673016">We suggest that the statute is at least ambiguous enough to require us to look to what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.419" offset="8695795">By doing that, it seems to us very clear that the interstate commerce requirement in the statute is designed to be a much broader concept than the idea of crossing a state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.525" offset="8736128">Congress knew in 1919, it knew in 1934, and it knew in 1939 how the phrase "interstate commerce" had been interpreted by this Court, and it relied on that broad concept that movement in interstate commerce as a basis and with the desire to stop that kind of movement in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.403" offset="8815645">So that the semantic argument, it seems to us, if anything, is quite clear in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.223" offset="8834975">Moreover, our semantic argument is buttressed significantly by the policy of this Act, which is to crush frauds committed on interstate commerce by use of the forged securities, and that policy is fully implemented in a case like this where the petitioner has shown himself capable of running back and forth between the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, making detection of his crime difficult, and making the... and if there were not a provision like this, making prosecution for his crime quite difficult.</text>

            <text syncTime="2461.000" offset="9962107">But when they want to do that, Your Honor, I would suggest that they know how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.654" offset="9980706">They did it in the second paragraph of 2314.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.060" offset="10018322">And they have never amended that, and three circuits have read it that it is plain and clear that what it means is that under this particular paragraph, not even the whole section, just this same paragraph, it means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.056" offset="10086345">The check has to be forged before its interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.674" offset="10104735">If the government wants to charge somebody under both sections, there is no prohibition against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.161" offset="10130753">They could have charged him with four or five sections, and perhaps sustained a valid conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.915" offset="10153741">They didn't do it in this case, and now the man stands convicted of the third paragraph of 2314, and what the government is attempting to do, as I say, is stretch that language all out of proportion to what it was intended to cover because Congress already covered that in the Section 2315--</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.296" offset="10335240">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.762" offset="10341091">You will notice that the Barfield case was decided by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the same court that decided Owens under 2314.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.551" offset="10384245">The reason is that it was easily sustainable in Barfield as a continuation because the man was riding in the car, he was clearly chargeable under Section 2 as a principal, a fact that you don't have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.745" offset="10457075">They didn't need any broad interpretation of 2312, because you have Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.935" offset="10485810">If I drive a car halfway across the state, and you and I are planning to drive a stolen car from Pittsburgh to Cleveland, and I do part of the driving and you do part of the driving to move it along, there is no question I am an aider and a better and a principal under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.480" offset="10556027">That clearly distinguishes Barfield from the case that we have here, and explains why the Fifth Circuit is the same court that drew this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.851" offset="10601480">They would have held, under 2314, that it is necessary that it be a stolen... a stolen car, which it was in Barfield, that crossed the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.393" offset="10647664">Here, the question is, was it just a check or was it a forged check that crossed the state line, and that is the distinguishing factor in that case.</text>
