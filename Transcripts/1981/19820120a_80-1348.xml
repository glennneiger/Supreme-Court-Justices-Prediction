            <label>Ms. Susan Gamble Smathers</label>
            <text syncTime="65.089" offset="260284">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="70.577" offset="282227">It is respectfully submitted that the central issue involved in this petition is whether the federal courts below exceeded the bounds of their constitutional authority attesting the validity of an apparently sufficient contract which was the basis for the state's assertion of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.324" offset="369267">We submit that the court's authority is limited to determining whether the state has an genuine interest in the subject matter of a dispute, and that once the state's interest is demonstrated, even though there may be defenses that may be asserted in another forum, that the inquiry of the federal court should cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.039" offset="464144">This Court does not sit today to decide the merits of the parties' contractual dispute; rather, the people of the State of Florida deserve to have a dispute over the ownership of historic artifacts, on display in many instances in their state museum, decided in a state court which is fully equipped to hear the issue and which, it must be assumed, can reach a decision which meets the ends of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.208" offset="580754">Briefly, the facts are in 1622 a flotilla of 28 Spanish ships was proceeding through the Florida straits and encountered a hurricane.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.933" offset="627670">Eight of the ships were lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.051" offset="636134">One of the ships, which was not subsequently recovered by the Spaniards, was the Nuestra Senora de Atocha.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.139" offset="664555">She went down with a precious metal cargo as well as a vast amount of artifacts from the 17th century which today may be worth as much as $400 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.847" offset="715337">Certainly the archaeological significance of those artifacts could have no price tag put on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.868" offset="743445">In 1971 under the authority of Florida's antiquities legislation the State of Florida Department of State entered into a contract with Respondents to search for and later recover the remains of the Atocha.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.795" offset="807079">Under the contract the state was to retain 25 percent of the artifacts recovered, and the Respondents were to be paid in kind for their services consisting of 75 percent of the artifacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.405" offset="861518">Then in March 1975 United States v. Florida was handed down which re established Florida's boundaries for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.045" offset="912091">It was at this point that Respondents filed an in rem complaint in admiralty in the Southern District of Florida for possession and confirmation of title to the remains of the Atocha.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.187" offset="964650">What is important for this Court to understand was that Respondents' in rem complaint sought possession and title to the unidentified remains of a vessel which were scattered below on the ocean floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.180" offset="1016686">The artifacts in dispute in today's action were not in dispute in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.417" offset="1037584">Florida was not a party to that proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.101" offset="1148343">The United States did intervene in that proceeding and claimed ownership of the wreck under the Federal Antiquities Act and the Abandoned Properties Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.940" offset="1183660">There had never before this time been any dispute between the United States and Florida as to who could exercise ownership or control of these artifacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.981" offset="1227860">The United States intervened, as I said, and claimed ownership under the Antiquities Act and the Abandoned Properties Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.724" offset="1398805">At some point that broke down and Respondents filed their complaint in rem in the Southern District Court for possession and title.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.847" offset="1439347">But as I say, that in rem complaint sought ownership of that which had not even been raised yet.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.590" offset="1494309">Florida, at that point having made a decision no longer to exercise jurisdiction in that area, did not intervene in the proceeding because the artifacts under which possession had already passed to the state and were in fact being worked on in the state laboratory, in some cases already on display, those artifacts were not in dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.268" offset="3945012">But under the Eleventh Amendment we have a right to assert a losing argument in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.858" offset="3971344">And Judge Rubin below in dissent expressed it very well when he said that the rule now of the majority is that suits against the state are permitted by the Eleventh Amendment if the result is that the state loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.533" offset="4030067">I think that's going much further than any of the cases of this Court have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.418" offset="4049607">And certainly in the Edelman decision, while these facts are not covered by the Edelman decision, Edelman did state that the Eleventh Amendment declares a policy of such compelling force that it is an explicit limitation on federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.447" offset="4121704">And in light of that thinking and that policy we think that the court in this case overstepped the bounds of its inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.087" offset="4164336">The court below justified its position that the Eleventh Amendment did not apply to the dispute based upon its reading of a 1921 decision In re New York, and the court below took this decision to mean that the Eleventh Amendment is merely a rebuttable presumption which may be defeated upon a showing of facts that it believed can refute a claim of state ownership of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.623" offset="4290456">In re New York held that the verified suggestion of ownership filed by New York's Attorney General as to state ownership of a tugboat in that case was sufficient evidence of state ownership to trigger the Eleventh Amendment, at least in the absence of a special challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.234" offset="4360882">It was the special challenge language that allowed the Fifth Circuit to infer that had the plaintiff in that case presented a genuine controversy as to the ownership of the tugboat that the court would have been obliged to take jurisdiction and hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.844" offset="4423367">We submit that In re New York holds, and it is the state of the law, that a court may initially examine a claim of state involvement to determine whether a state's being genuinely sued in a case; but that once the state's presence is discovered, the suit must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.841" offset="4503301">We would also submit that the reasoning, this rebuttable presumption argument, simply begs the jurisdictional question in the most fundamental way, since all it does is allow the plaintiff to reassert his position on the merits, the Eleventh Amendment notwithstanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.803" offset="4875180">What the majority holds is that the state must defend an action to rescind a contract in order to prevail on the question of Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.492" offset="4917917">It's one thing to determine... to inquire into your jurisdiction and to see whether the state's genuinely a party or to determine whether there's even a contract that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.632" offset="4966504">But once we came into court with a contract in our hand, if you please, and the possession of the artifacts already in the state museum, I would submit at that point it was obvious that the state was very involved and very interested in the litigation, and that the suit should have been dismissed to a state court which could hear the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.184" offset="5072666">The majority, as I've stated, also used its jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction analysis, the question being that if the merits are so inextricably intertwined with the... if the question of jurisdiction is so intimately tied to the merits, then the majority can look to the merits to determine jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.638" offset="5298469">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.756" offset="5311007">This is the fourth major appellate argument in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.208" offset="5324800">It was filed nearly seven years ago, and I filed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.094" offset="5336294">The case is not concerning a question of the relative merits of federal and state government, but a question of the right of an individual against the massive power of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.301" offset="5385195">It involves the protection of private property rights and the power of the federal judiciary to determine constitutional jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.109" offset="5428349">Now, the wreck of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha was found after three years of search by Treasure Salvors, and as previously determined by this Court, it was outside the territorial boundaries of the United States and that of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.583" offset="5486237">The factual findings of the trial court have for the most part not even been attacked on appeal, and none have ever been found to contain any error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.325" offset="5525211">The 38-page memorandum of the trial court discloses one of the most interesting and relevant factual situations you could ever believe which must form the background of this Court's final and at last unappealable opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.650" offset="5582576">The Atocha's association with Florida was tangential at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.286" offset="5601071">When it sank in 1622 it was outside the boundaries of a continent, largely unexplored, which was much later to be called Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.375" offset="5637433">The State of Florida did not research, they did not find, and there is no basis in fact for even suggesting they could have found it, much less recovered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.350" offset="5677349">The trial court in its November 21st, 1978 order states as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.735" offset="5698873">"Merely because the agents of the state covet the treasure does not give the agents the right to take it in the name of the state. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.990" offset="5727922">And the court went on to say:</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.557" offset="5734191">"It's ironic that the agents of the state are able to use resources of the state to deprive Treasure Salvors of what it justfully and rightfully owns, especially when the record reflects that Treasure Salvors was at one time willing to donate a portion of the salvage vessel to the state. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.552" offset="5802109">Now, the record reflects that the State of Florida and the United States were working secretly in 1975 to completely vest title in the United States with Florida having the exclusive right to continue the salvage started by Treasure Salvors four years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.865" offset="5879432">When these covert activities were discovered, Treasure Salvors filed its in rem action against the Atocha, and this Court ruled on Florida's boundaries in U.S. v. Florida, and the state rushed at that point, knowing that it was losing, under its contract which said that we had the right to do out and salvage on state owned sovereign submerged lands if we paid them $1,200 a year, the state at that time rushed to divide much of the salvaged treasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.218" offset="5996774">But they were only dividing... they had everything that we had recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.104" offset="6016313">They had never given us a division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.639" offset="6022478">We had asked for a division over and over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.240" offset="6032927">And they talk about these series of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.942" offset="6043690">The reason there was a series of contracts is that there was a total forfeiture provision if we stopped short of a total recovery; so we had no option but to continue the salvage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.750" offset="6090919">And then with their plan... and the trial court found that this was an ongoing plan to keep all of it, and that was a factual finding of the trial court after the evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.039" offset="6132088">But what happened was one week prior to this Court issuing its opinion, after the oral arguments and after they went back and said boy, we just got cleaned, the state rushed to try this division; but they only divided about 80 percent of what was up there, and they kept the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.852" offset="6211396">Now, frustrated in its desire to obtain the entire treasure, the state encouraged and worked with the United States to claim everything, past, present, and future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.292" offset="6245146">There were negotiations which Mike Reed talks about in the San Diego Law Review, the Assistant Solicitor of the United States, when the State of Florida comes up and says hey, listen, we've lost this thing; you've got to protect our interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.266" offset="6296973">Now, after extensive evidentiary hearings the trial court found that the state chose not to enter a claim but to rely upon the United States to win the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.722" offset="6334798">And they even went so far as to decide how they were going to divide up the spoils once the United States won.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.542" offset="6558093">The Court of Appeals rested primarily on the fact that the court must have jurisdiction at least to find out the propriety of the claim being put forward, and that's why U.S. v. Lee is so much on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.485" offset="6617861">The state, after all this litigation, tremendous amount of litigation, working with the federal government in this two and a half years of litigation, then after the litigation is decided in a manner which the state didn't like at all, tried to paint themselves as total strangers to litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.659" offset="12638563">Now Florida insists that it has greater control over salvage on the high seas than the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.332" offset="12665313">The trial court's holding that the state was in privity with the United States and was bound also for failure to intervene is a valid basis to affirm the lower court's opinion because it would obviate the Eleventh Amendment arguments made by Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.258" offset="12728947">If the state had intervened claiming against the United States, there would have been no Eleventh Amendment defense, and the state litigated by proxy, and it litigated very hard by proxy and it lost, and now they want to play another fast and loose game.</text>

            <text syncTime="3696.707" offset="14786769">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.159" offset="14796591">Every state has to operate through its officials, and I think it would be a difference without a difference if we were to say that Ex parte Young could apply in any case where the state was the real party in interest, and yet, obviously the state's interest has to be conveyed and carried out by its officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.191" offset="14888751">I don't think that the Court in Ex parte Young intended to draw that fine a distinction, and certainly in Alabama v. Pugh this Court recognized even where the relief requested could still be achieved by not dismissing the State of Alabama, the Court recognized that it was important enough to dismiss the State of Alabama because of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.323" offset="14985195">We would also dispute Respondent's representation that the division of artifacts occurred after United States v. Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.179" offset="15024692">The last division of artifacts occurred in February 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.316" offset="15041202">United States v. Florida was handed down in March 1975, and that is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.387" offset="15065548">We would also argue with their interpretation of In re Muir, the Navemar, and the Republic of Mexico cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.111" offset="15108389">The Eleventh Amendment was not involved in those cases, and if the Eleventh Amendment is to continue to have the compelling force that this Court has held that it does in Edelman and in its most recent cases, that In re Muir and these cases should not be held to carve an exception.</text>
