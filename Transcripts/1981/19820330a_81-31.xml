            <text syncTime="30.019" offset="258912">This case is here by the United States and the State of California from a decision of the District Court for the Central District of California holding that the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and its state counterpart may not constitutionally protect the employees of certain religiously oriented schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.831" offset="338115">Last term this Court decided in St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church versus South Dakota that 26 U.S.C. 3309(b) exempted the employees of schools operated by a church or organization of churches from coverage under the federal-state unemployment tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.827" offset="418154">The district court decided this case before St. Martin was handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.131" offset="435291">Our case originally involved three kinds of schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.183" offset="451486">The district court identified them as: category one schools, those operated directly by a church or organization of churches... and category one schools are the only kind that were involved in St. Martin; category two schools are separately incorporated, but controlled or operated by a church or organization of churches, primarily for religious purposes; category three schools are religiously oriented schools that are independent of any specific church or organization of churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.971" offset="586696">The district court found that Section 3309(b) and the counterpart state statute exempted category one and category two schools, but not category three schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.897" offset="642389">None of the parties here contest that ruling, so there's no statutory issue before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.707" offset="701635">The district court also held that the category three schools have a First Amendment right to exemption from the Act, because the state could not make benefit determinations for employees of these statements without becoming unconstitutionally entangled in matters of religious doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="724.147" offset="3035415">Well, my argument on the merits basically is that this case really follows from Lee and that Lee stands for the principle that once you enter the marketplace and hire employees to provide goods or services, you cannot deny those employees the benefit of generally applicable statutory protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.644" offset="3121410">There's no First Amendment right to deny one's employees the economic security of social security and unemployment insurance coverage, any more than there is a First Amendment right to deny them a safe workplace or the protection of child labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.003" offset="3178775">The further question is whether or not there is a reasonable basis for distinguishing between category one and two schools and category three schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.596" offset="3245230">And we submit that this is a reasonable, bright-line test, and once you... if that bright-line test does not apply, then that the question of determining when... what schools are so religious in orientation that they should be treated as category two schools involves very serious problems of distinguishing between schools that are going to be of various types.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.721" offset="3401651">You really can't make a distinction based on the degree of the school's religious orientation, because religious orientation is not a readily identifiable characteristic by which various schools can be compared.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.266" offset="3467898">In sum, we don't believe there's any constitutional reason to deny the employees of these independent schools of the unemployment benefits that Congress decided they should enjoy.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.170" offset="3607496">I wish to clarify first the State of California's position with respect to the 1341 issue that was raised by the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.343" offset="3640202">What must be kept in mind is that a plain, speedy and adequate remedy must be available at state law and state court before the Tax Injunction Act arises here.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.316" offset="3688058">Now, the State's position is very simply this, is that the Federal Government... there was relief sought against the Federal Government directly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.291" offset="3727973">There was injunctive relief sought, declaratory relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.410" offset="3740407">A federal statute was being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.960" offset="3750647">The Federal Government could not be compelled to litigate any kind of these issues in state court if it didn't wish to.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.849" offset="3778233">In fact, the Federal Government did remove one of these two cases, the Lutheran case, from state court to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.586" offset="3801116">So basically what it comes down to is that, like was noted in your Java decision of, I think, 402 U.S., where in a footnote towards the end of the decision at page 135 it was noted that to accord complete relief to the plaintiffs in that particular case the question was raised whether or not the Federal Government should have been a party in the action as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.682" offset="5277557">I think that any injunction against federal taxes would be handled under 7421 of the Internal revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.052" offset="5303052">This is having to do with state taxes only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.338" offset="5312143">So therefore, because of the posture of this case, I think that the only really relief that would accord... possible for the plaintiffs in this matter was to be in federal court, have the Federal Government in there, because the state was stuck in a position of having to try to figure out whether they should comply with what the Federal Government was mandating... excuse me... or decide to follow what the court was telling them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.292" offset="5435963">Now, the court enjoined the state and the state was stuck into a position of either... of doing exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.529" offset="5464907">In fact, there is evidence in our case about how conformity proceedings were taken, were begun with respect to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.516" offset="5488835">And so the situation of this case, the Federal Government was absolutely essential to be in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.586" offset="5509106">If I may get to some of the merits of this, I believe that we've handled basically all of the issues that we wish to raise in our main brief and also our redly brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.994" offset="5558739">But I wish to put the case in proper perspective, is that if we get to the merits in this matter... and we wish you do... the employees are basically the forgotten people in this whole system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.904" offset="5614432">There's evidence, there are discussions completely throughout, about the employer's rights, the employer's religious beliefs, the employer's burdens, alleged burdens or whatever they may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.045" offset="5658944">Yet what it comes down to, if the tax exemption here is extended to cover these non-church affiliated religious employers, what will happen directly is that these employees then are denied benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.269" offset="5707846">They cannot get any unemployment benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.638" offset="5721325">So quite consistent with your decision in U.S. versus Lee is that the employer's beliefs will be basically being imposed upon these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.077" offset="5755075">And we have a situation here that we don't have church affiliated schools involved, we have independent religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.231" offset="5783705">And these independent religious schools, one of the main reasons they're independent is they don't want to be church affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.467" offset="5804708">They want to draw from as broad a base of students as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.019" offset="5818918">And although they may have a requirement of born-again Christians for their teachers or whatever the case may be, there's nothing in the record that says that every one of their employees agrees with their position about the unemployment compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.894" offset="5870327">So to basically deny these employees the right to get unemployment benefits would be a denial of their own beliefs, in fact, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.952" offset="5910660">I think that the situation here is actually closely analogous, if not virtually identical, to what Sherbert, Sherbert versus Verner and the Thomas case discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.426" offset="5960502">We're talking about a situation there where there was the state action prohibiting the... well, the state action in denial of an employee's benefits was prohibited because of the employee's lack of faith or because of their own faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.601" offset="6029256">You, this Court, held that that was just not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.255" offset="6043780">By the same token here, we have those same benefits being denied to the employees if the exemption is extended, and this time it's because of the employer's beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.028" offset="6078889">And I would submit that it's no more permissible in the second instance than it was in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.832" offset="6338128">I mean, the employer obviously has certain beliefs, and this has been an accommodation all throughout the entire program, that the employer has certain beliefs, has certain interests that have been accommodated in three fashions: it's been accommodated by extension of the FUTA exemption for all religious employers, the extension of the California exemption to church related employers, and finally, that the employer itself has the reimbursable method of contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.233" offset="6447738">So there has been an accommodation of the religious employer's beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.685" offset="6461531">There is an accommodation of the religious employee's beliefs as well, but it's under a situation that if the employer changes the work rules after the fact, like a Thomas or a Sherbert case, the employee if that is then against his religious beliefs and he wishes not... that he just cannot comply with this, well then that employee cannot be denied benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.181" offset="6547526">So basically what we come to is really a balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.133" offset="6555362">I mean, it's an attempt to take in everybody's beliefs as possible, but still maintain a comprehensive nationwide program, which is the public's interest in this entire thing, as well, as the point of protection against wage loss for the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.340" offset="7648117">--Well, I tell you, Mr. Chief Justice, I think we get to the jurisdictional problem through the entanglement problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.778" offset="7681867">May I explain that to the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.412" offset="7688450">The second kind of an entanglement is entanglement relating to the ordinary administration of the Act apart from the benefit eligibility determination process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.086" offset="7735157">Now, to come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.288" offset="7739963">In the benefit determination process, a process which can arise at the very outset of employment, because the employee may already have picked up four quarters of work through another employer, the governmental parties, as Mr. Vesely just made clear, they say that religious ministries can avoid any entanglement problem simply by establishing work rules, requiring a teacher to conform to, as the reply brief of the Government said, the principal's interpretation of doctrinal and moral matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.009" offset="7878830">At the trial, the United States through its own expert witnesses attempted then to provide a showcase demonstration of how the work rule works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.567" offset="7925119">But as the testimony turned out, it became crystal-clear that whether the kind of blank check a agreement was used which the Government had recommended in its reply brief, namely the employee agrees that whatever the employer says is doctrine and a proper code of conduct, that the employee agrees to conform to, or whether it's a long, spelled-out statement of faith with all manner of rules of conduct and all the essential doctrines of faith spelled out, either way, as Justice... Judge Mariana Feltzer below said so accurately, the complexities of religious faith are not reducible to work rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.882" offset="8110380">Note here that it's perfectly clear that the Government witnesses were completely correct in saying, this is how a benefit eligibility determination process has to work in any kind of employment, in any kind of institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.641" offset="8165341">But these witnesses also conclusively demonstrated that when that process is applied to a religious ministry, it veritably explodes with potential for entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.449" offset="8216646">We had example after example where Government expert Ernest Carter, for example, was called to the stand by the Government and he was asked, suppose this teacher entered into an understanding with the school that he or she was to observe a document called a statement of faith, and that school discharges her on the ground that she breached the statement of faith, taught something contrary to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.100" offset="8323225">Would the hearing examiner examine what that agreement was?</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.468" offset="8336704">Answer: He would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.670" offset="8341511">Well, the questioning pursued, what if they disagree about what the doctrine was?</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.907" offset="8366380">The employer says, you breached it, and the employee says, no, I didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.042" offset="8382993">What does the hearing examiner do in that case, the Government was asked?</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.013" offset="8402846">Answer: Well, he, the state, has to weigh the evidence from both parties and decide in favor of one or the other, weigh the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.136" offset="8439313">Government experts were asked about cases where an employee is discharged for a decline in religious fervor relating to the students, a very important element in a religious school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.260" offset="8487797">The witness said; I would have great difficulty in measuring zeal and what that meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.997" offset="8514755">But I would ask what harm that does, what harm that loss of zeal does to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.353" offset="8544221">Then the witness was asked, well, who would judge that, the claims examiner?</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.340" offset="8568149">Answer: Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.873" offset="8574314">The implied work rule also same very much into scope through the testimony of the Government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.196" offset="8603571">They were asked, does the hearing examiner ever get into the question of whether a particular implied work rule, a doctrine, a piece of the statement of faith; for example, is reasonable or unreasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.920" offset="8654458">Answer: Yes, and whether it's enforced or not, thus taking the state examiner into the whole life of the institution in order to find out what is enforced, and with whom, and when, and how often, and to what degree, into the faith community with that kind of examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.215" offset="13211676">It seems to me the Court in Catholic Bishop attached an appendix to its opinion in which it showed that a certain Monsignor O'Donnell had been discussing liturgy and asking questions about Catholic liturgy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.475" offset="13268727">And these were, I thought, shown by the Court to be an example of an area into which the state ought not be going, irrespective of whether it is in a labor situation or whatever situation it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.949" offset="13326615">We also dealt with the problem of free exercise, and I'll touch briefly upon that, only to say that we believe that there is a marked contrast here to Lee, to Braunfeld, and to Murdoch and Fallett.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.498" offset="13420760">In contrast to Lee, here a religious activity is being taxed, and indeed a prime religious activity, namely a ministry of teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.556" offset="13469034">Mr. Lee never claimed that making a profit by hiring six or seven employees to produce rough lumber for commercial housing was a religious activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.016" offset="13542909">In contrast to inferences in Murdoch and Fallett that a preacher is not entitled to be free from taxes, here the tax is not on anybody's personal income, but on the most sensitive aspect, the most sensitive aspect of a school ministry, namely the employment relationship between teachers and the school administration itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.049" offset="13643010">The Government has put squarely to the Court, it seems to me, the proposition that religious activity may be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.155" offset="13679372">And no Aesopian language about relatively small amounts or indirect burdens changes that very stark reality, and no compelling state interest certainly exists for imposing this tax on Redwood Christian Schools and the Christian Schools of San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.568" offset="13761083">A broad exception already substantially exists in the statutes as they are, a very, very broad exception, not a narrow exception, to which the exception of the church... of the non-church schools adds but very, very slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.411" offset="13820433">All schools until 1978 were exempt, and therefore one must inquire, what's the compelling state interest now in saying that these non-church schools are subject to the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.609" offset="14029204">As to equal protection, perhaps I should mention here just briefly the statements that have been made about employees by the California Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.083" offset="14079150">First of all, no employee is a party to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.571" offset="14101093">No beliefs here have been imposed upon anybody's rights that were not, for example, imposed on rights of employees in Catholic Bishop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.860" offset="14146233">The churches have not... the churches there, in cases such as Catholic Bishop, were not thought to be denying their employees' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.186" offset="14199522">Here the testimony of Mr. Enderland at page 89, to which I commend the Court, is very, very clear that all personnel, whether it's a bus driver, a janitor, an accountant or whomever, are felt to be and believe themselves to be part of the religious mission of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.100" offset="14279248">We come then down finally to the equal protection considerations, and feel that Redwood Christian Schools ought not to be treated differently from the church schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.789" offset="14317909">There are three bases for that statement:</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.574" offset="14329090">One is the argument of the court below, the rationale of the court below, on the issue of entanglement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.263" offset="14359810">We have raised an equal protection claim with strict scrutiny basis, as Justice Brennan had mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.750" offset="14389798">And then I refer you to the American Jewish Congress' brief, which simply says that disparate treatment of church versus non-church schools violates the very core of the unitary protection of the religion clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.677" offset="14453537">I think that too is a most significant consideration in connection with this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3714.563" offset="14997093">What we're talking about is not a discharge for religious reasons, but a discharge for a violation of the work rule, and the work rule... you don't have to have any inquiry into the religious doctrine of the school, of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.322" offset="15064071">What the work rule would require would be that the teacher would follow the directions of the principal or whoever was in charge in teaching, similar to any secular schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.700" offset="15129586">The teachers are supposed to follow the directions of those in charge of the curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.354" offset="15152260">And if they did not, then that would be misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.223" offset="15171695">You don't get into questions of what's the correct doctrine or any real religious questions.</text>
