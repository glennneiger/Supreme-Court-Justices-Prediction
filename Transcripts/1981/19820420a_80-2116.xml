            <text syncTime="48.747" offset="323523">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="54.917" offset="348183">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.321" offset="369812">The general questions presented are: whether the Congress, in passing Section 1014 of Title XVIII of the United States Code intended to proscribe the deposit of a bad check or 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.796" offset="531667">In this case there were three counts of an indictment and Mr. Williams, the Petitioner, was convicted on all three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.335" offset="569805">The first count was a misapplication count and really is only indirectly in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.988" offset="596450">The other two counts both involved an allegation of the overvaluation of a security, that is a check, in order to influence the action of a federally... excuse me... insured bank on an advance or extension of credit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="136.652" stopTime="139.854">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="136.652" offset="675131">All three counts were under 1014?</text>

            <text syncTime="139.854" offset="687879">Two counts.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="140.554" stopTime="141.104">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="140.554" offset="690700">Two counts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nickolas P. Chilivis</label>
            <text syncTime="141.104" offset="692894">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.704" offset="695298">Now, in this case the Court has limited the consideration on certiorari to two counts, counts two and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.124" offset="724973">But I think it's significant that we consider what counts two and three were.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.762" offset="743572">Count two was the overvaluation of 58,500 which was deposited, drawn on the Winn State Bank and deposited in the Pelican State Bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.977" offset="840434">And the Government--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="179.343" offset="845867">That would have something to do with its value, wouldn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nickolas_p_chilivis" startTime="181.512" stopTime="397.103">
            <label>Mr. Nickolas P. Chilivis</label>
            <text syncTime="181.512" offset="854540">--Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.364" offset="861959">It was a check that did not have funds to support it, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.618" offset="886932">Now, that check did clear the bank in the normal course of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.503" offset="902501">It was not dishonored; it was paid, and it never came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.539" offset="914622">The other check was a $60,000 check drawn on the Pelican State Bank, which was deposited in the Winn State Bank, and that covered the first check.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.096" offset="960911">That check too was paid by the bank and was not returned for insufficient funds, although at the time it was deposited there were not funds in the bank sufficient to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.420" offset="1010125">Now, the Pelican State Bank, which was where it all started, had the choice in that instance of bouncing the check or extending credit on the check, which resulted in an overdraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.045" offset="1056623">It chose to extend credit and have an overdraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.930" offset="1072192">Now, when this transaction started Williams had an overdraft at the Pelican State Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.334" offset="1097792">Now, we ask the Court to bear in mind that this started off with an overdraft at the Pelican State Bank on May the 9th of something over $58,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.808" offset="1143768">The whole transaction ended on May the 11th, two days later, with an overdraft at the Pelican State Bank of something less than $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.347" offset="1181907">No check was dishonored.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.366" offset="1189952">No check was bounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.066" offset="1196744">And it was two separate checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.551" offset="1206671">Now, we mention that because we raised this issue in the Court of Appeals, that is the sufficiency of the indictment under Section 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.559" offset="1250765">The Court of Appeals summarily dismissed that by saying that the argument was without merit, because the two transactions at the two banks constitute classical check kiting, and under Payne, which was a Fifth Circuit case, this check kiting falls within the scope of Section 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.239" offset="1337492">Now, that's significant because they used both counts of the indictment to create the concept of check kiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.728" offset="1371451">And as we know and as this Court has held, you cannot do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.866" offset="1387961">Each count must stand on its own and you cannot say that if both counts constitute an offense then one can be used in the other count unless it's incorporated therein by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.689" offset="1439265">In this case it wasn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.039" offset="1444698">Now, the argument in this case ought to be simple, then.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.879" offset="1476045">In its simplest terms, no crime was alleged in the indictment under counts two and three and no crime was proved within Section 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.020" offset="1520558">However, the case has become complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.822" offset="1535814">It's become complicated because the Government contends that a check is a security, a security under Section 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.363" offset="1577923">Now, I remind the Court of the language of Section 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.565" offset="1594746">It says:</text>
            <text syncTime="367.132" offset="1597045">"Whoever makes a false statement or report, or whoever overvalues land, property or security for the purpose of influencing a federally insured bank to extend credit or make advances. "</text>
            <text syncTime="383.793" offset="1663709">and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.976" offset="1668411">It uses the word "security", not "a security".</text>
            <text syncTime="388.747" offset="1683458">But in this case the Government claims that a check is a security and therefore this constituted the overvaluation of a security.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="397.103" offset="1716894">Counsel, I suppose that a check could be property in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.325" offset="1757750">But this says</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.162" offset="11393172">The rule of lenity so often invoked by Petitioner applies only where there is a grievous ambiguity in the language or structure of the Act, that is entirely lacking on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.406" offset="11446148">And the numerous hyper-technical objections to his indictment and the instructions of the trial court, as I've already mentioned, were raised for the first time before this Court and do not rise to the level of plain error requiring reversal of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.849" offset="11511872">Petitioner's final argument is that his conviction must be reversed because a check kiting conviction requires the prosecution to prove an intent to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.923" offset="11560147">The short answer to this contention is that the Petitioner was not indicted for check kiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.993" offset="11584493">He was indicted for making an intentional false statement or willfully overvaluing a security for the purpose of influencing a federally insured bank upon a loan, advance or commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.285" offset="11629632">Each count of his indictment clearly sets forth those facts, clearly sets forth those allegations, and is sufficient to sustain a statutory violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.826" offset="11671846">The term "check kiting" as used throughout this... the Government's brief and by Petitioner is simply descriptive of Petitioner's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.198" offset="11709254">The question here is not whether this conduct requires some specific intent to defraud in order to be culpable, but rather whether Petitioner's conduct that can be described as check kiting falls within the reach of a federal statute that prohibits intentional misrepresentations for the purpose of influencing the credit decisions of a federally insured bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.378" offset="11797965">As stated in Petition's reply brief, the overall question is whether the allegations of counts two and three are subject to prosecution under Section 1014, regardless of how they are labeled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.521" offset="11846553">No matter how one labels the conduct of Petitioner, it clearly comes within the reach of Section 1014 and states a violation of that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.255" offset="12065564">They did not make a specific charge of making a false statement.</text>
