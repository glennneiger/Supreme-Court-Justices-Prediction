            <text syncTime="7.091" offset="167197">Mr. Karas, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Simon B. Karas</label>
            <text syncTime="48.184" offset="331559">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.762" offset="333858">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.105" offset="347233">In the three cases before this Court for decision, the state of Ohio is attempting to give meaning and content to the decision in Wainwright v. Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.974" offset="394776">The Court is well aware of the deviceiveness and divergence of opinions in the court below, but I think that there is one word that is missing from all of those opinions that acts as a common defect, and that is the absence of the word "federalism".</text>
            <text syncTime="80.624" offset="461336">The state sees this issue as federalism, pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.825" offset="482129">In a single decision, the court below has avoided Ohio's construction of its contemporaneous objection rule and has also overturned a state's construction of its own substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.460" offset="544718">If Wainwright v. Sykes is to have any meaning, it must be grounded in the concept that federalism allows a state certain latitudes in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.251" offset="595814">The facts in our case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.703" offset="601665">Prior to 1974, Ohio filed the common law rule that the 3 defendant bore the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence on the affirmative defense of self-defense, insanity and duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.757" offset="693825">On January 1, 1974, the legislature enacted Ohio revised Code 2901.05(A) which provided that the defendant has the burden of going forward with evidence of the affirmative defense.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="150.563" offset="741055">Was this special legislation or was it part of a general--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_b_karas" startTime="153.828" stopTime="262.708">
            <label>Mr. Simon B. Karas</label>
            <text syncTime="153.828" offset="754116">It was part of a code revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.875" offset="762371">There was a complete revision of the definitions of Ohio substantive crimes; there was also a revision of the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.527" offset="800927">Ohio adopted criminal rules of procedure at that time contemporaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.446" offset="828617">There was a little bit of divergence in the time when they took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.195" offset="847634">The rule started in 1973 and some of the substantive sections in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.036" offset="870936">Now, on July 21, 1976, the Ohio Supreme Court decided the case of State v. Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.842" offset="918165">In that case the court held that the defendant no longer bore the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence, though he did retain a burden of production on the affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.151" offset="967484">The three cases before the Court all occurred prior to the Robinson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.551" offset="1025058">Mr. Hughes' case occurred in January of 1975, Mr. Bell's in April of 1975, Mr. Isaac's in I believe it was September of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.580" offset="1049195">The decision in State v. Robinson was subsequently held retroactive to all cases that had been tried after January 1, 1974, which was the date that the statute took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.402" offset="1108441">At none of the trials did the defendants object to the traditional instruction that the defendant bore the burden of proof by preponderance of the evidence, but if he failed to prove that defense by that burden, the state still bore the burden of proof as to all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="262.708" stopTime="286.213">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="262.708" offset="1189629">We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.705" offset="1201646">Counsel, you may resume.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_b_karas" startTime="286.213" stopTime="484.320">
            <label>Mr. Simon B. Karas</label>
            <text syncTime="286.213" offset="1283670">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.915" offset="1290462">I will pick up with the facts because I believe it's very important how these cases developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.975" offset="1314704">I had just pointed out that there had been no objection to the traditional instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.097" offset="1343229">On appeal, only one of the three defendants raised the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.018" offset="1366949">That was Mr. Isaac.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.704" offset="1369665">It's not quite clear whether he was raising it on the basis that the state court should apply the Robinson decision as to him, or whether there was a simultaneous challenge to the validity of the traditional instruction as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.963" offset="1442704">On federal habeas corpus, the various district courts decided the case alternatively on a lack of showing of cause, and also a lack of showing of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.878" offset="1498292">On rehearing en banc, the court was quite split.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.579" offset="1525146">There were six separate opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.517" offset="1528908">The plurality opinion found that cause was shown by the apparent futility of raising the question prior to Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.497" offset="1576764">As to the cause question, and despite the fact that State v. Robinson was a state statutory interpretation, the court found that Ohio had created an additional element of the crime of absence of the affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.051" offset="1651056">Now, our petition has challenged both the cause and prejudice rulings by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.092" offset="1703197">I think for purposes of analysis it would be easier to start with the cause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.684" offset="1729528">I start, as I think I must, with the decision in Hankerson v. North Carolina, footnote 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.402" offset="1732454">In Hankerson, the court was concerned with the impact of applying Mullaney v. Wilbur retroactive to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.193" offset="1787624">I think it ties in with the question of Wainwright because Hankerson was decided six days prior to the opinion in Wainwright v. Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.326" offset="1864111">Now, in Hankerson, in response to the state's concern that Mullaney would dictate over 700 rehearsals of homicide convictions, the court in the footnote posited that the fears of the state were not as great as might be imagined because the states, if they wish, may be able to insulate prior convictions by enforcing the normal contemporaneous objection rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.115" offset="1943314">In these cases, that's exactly what Ohio did.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.893" offset="1958361">In State v. Williams and State v. Humphries they found that the failure to have objected was a waiver of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.998" offset="2006844">In State v. Long, they further indicated that they would not hold a State v. Robinson error to be plain error just merely by citation to the case, but that you actually had to look at the facts and circumstances of the individual case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="484.320" stopTime="499.345">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="484.320" offset="2076121">What's your response, counsel, to the argument that up until the Ohio Supreme Court decision in Robinson it had been set a law in Ohio that this instruction would not be given?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_b_karas" startTime="499.345" stopTime="611.941">
            <label>Mr. Simon B. Karas</label>
            <text syncTime="499.345" offset="2136202">Your Honor, I believe that Hankerson shows the correct analysis for a question of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.246" offset="2187820">I don't see Hankerson as being a novel question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.135" offset="2207360">I think it's a recognition of a longstanding doctrine that a reviewing court need not reach an issue which a party complaining of the error could have brought to the attention of the court but did not, at a time when the court could have corrected it or the error could have been avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.251" offset="2283847">Now, notice that I say the word could have rather than would have, because I think that there's a distinction to be drawn between the two words, and also, that that distinction is the difference between our position and the position of the plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.542" offset="2349048">When I use the words could have been raised, I don't mean it in some metaphysical sense that you could always raise a question; that counsel should anticipate a 35th amendment to the Constitution that has not yet been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.833" offset="2414145">I'm also not indulging in the legal fiction that once a court declares the law, that it is deemed always to have been the law and therefore, a failure to object is a waiver of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.936" offset="2474540">I think it's a recognition of the fact that when the tools are available to construct the argument, that you can charge counsel with the obligation of raising that argument; otherwise, a failure to raise it will be deemed binding on the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.195" offset="2555624">The argument of the court of appeals about a apparent futility--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="611.941" stopTime="621.843">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="611.941" offset="2586553">Do you think you could say counsel was incompetent, constitutionally incompetent, if he didn't raise it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_b_karas" startTime="621.843" stopTime="651.349">
            <label>Mr. Simon B. Karas</label>
            <text syncTime="621.843" offset="2626155">--Well, Mr. Justice White, I think that is somewhat of the extension that the respondents are trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.245" offset="2671817">They are going one step farther and are using the words "should have raised" the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.446" offset="2696581">Our concern about Wainwright v. Sykes is that if you don't identify any middle ground in which the actions of counsel can be deemed binding on the client--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="651.349" stopTime="652.176">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="651.349" offset="2744229">And not incompetent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_b_karas" startTime="652.176" stopTime="748.169">
            <label>Mr. Simon B. Karas</label>
            <text syncTime="652.176" offset="2747572">--And not incompetent, that you effectively destroy the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.564" offset="2769097">If the objection is well known, then the failure of counsel to raise it will be deemed ineffectiveness of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.547" offset="2805042">If the objection is not well known, then under the court of appeals decision it is deemed inadvertence or apparent futility, and is found to be cause, and there's no middle ground between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.571" offset="2857078">I think we're giving recognition of the fact that there's a whole range of decisions that counsel are entrusted to make, and sometimes, the power to make a decision includes the power to err or the power not to see a question that should have been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.969" offset="2938684">Take, for example, the argument of a apparent futility.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.077" offset="2955089">Assume that counsel actually saw the argument and failed to raise it because of the nature of the prior Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.901" offset="3010469">That is as strategic as any other decision that counsel is supposed to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.961" offset="3026664">Now, the fact that he does not raise it when he sees the argument and fails to raise it in light of the prior law, is, in the words of Mr. Justice Powell, I believe, an inexcusable procedural default of a known right.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.533" offset="3092911">On the other hand, if the objection is not perceived but could have been perceived--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="748.169" stopTime="749.293">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="748.169" offset="3131468">Like the fellow perceived it who finally raised it and had a decision on it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_b_karas" startTime="749.293" stopTime="1217.136">
            <label>Mr. Simon B. Karas</label>
            <text syncTime="749.293" offset="3135961">--Obviously, the question was raised, and any time you have an overruling of a prior precedent or a new development in the law, somebody has to make the first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.444" offset="3200640">But I think that argument can be shown by a distinction between the cases of O'Connor v. Ohio and Lee v. Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.331" offset="3220180">In Lee v. Missouri, this Court held that Duran v. Missouri was retroactive as to the date of Taylor v. Louisiana; but indicated that the failure to have objected might be deemed a waiver of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.106" offset="3291233">I think what the Court was saying is that as of the date of Taylor v. Louisiana, the objection could have been raised even if it was not raised in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.993" offset="3330834">Now, in the case of O'Connor v. Ohio... and I'd like to state right at the beginning that I don't believe that our position requires the overruling of O'Connor v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.894" offset="3370436">I think it requires a different look at the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.612" offset="3377228">But in O'Connor v. Ohio, the trial took place five and a half months before Malloy v. Hogan, and I think that it can fairly be said that the tools were not even available for counsel to have constructed the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.121" offset="3451311">It might be a different case once Malloy v. Hogan had been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.151" offset="3463432">The court didn't have to deal with those types of questions and split the difference between could have raised it or would have raised it or should have raised it, when you're operating under the deliberate bypass test.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.663" offset="3513482">But once you go to the notion that the actions of counsel can bind a client, then I think you have to look at it in a different light.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.564" offset="3549113">The decision in O'Connor v. Ohio, of course, was the decision that was cited by the appellate court as to why the result was dictated that counsel should not anticipate a future development of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.322" offset="3640124">But I think if you look at Ohio law in a real sense, the question could have been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.382" offset="3656320">I'm not going to deny that it was difficult; I merely say that the grounds were there that counsel could have raised the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.958" offset="3686622">First of all, In Re Winship had been decided five years prior to the development in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.000" offset="3714834">Mullaney v. Wilbur had been decided three months prior to the trial in Mr. Isaac's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.154" offset="3743464">There was discussion of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.775" offset="3781917">The first appellate court decision in Ohio that held the Robinson way was December 24, 1974, which was well prior to the trials in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.647" offset="3825384">If you look at the State v. Robinson opinion itself, it makes reference to the 1979 Technical Committee Report on the proposed criminal reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.001" offset="3854851">There's also reference to a Law Journal article, v. Wilbur.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.685" offset="3905528">And the curious thing about that is that the Law Review article starts out with the proposition that the legislature did not intend to change the law, but then concludes arguing that Mullaney v. Wilbur should have dictated the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.272" offset="3979925">I would invite the Court to look at that Law Review article and see whether or not an Ohio counsel could have raised the question in this time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.717" offset="4041678">There's one other thing that I'd like to note with respect to the question of "could have raised it".</text>
            <text syncTime="977.467" offset="4048679">That is the argument that has been made on behalf of the respondent Bell that self defense inherently requires the state to disprove the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.867" offset="4102282">That argument, which I will submit is not correct either based on Ohio law or on this Court's decisions in Patterson v. New York or Rivera v. Delaware, doesn't depend at all on the change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.986" offset="4174798">The argument, could it be constructed accurately according to Ohio law now, could have been constructed according to Ohio law then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.031" offset="4194965">Robinson didn't change that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.045" offset="4206981">Our concern is that a limitation of Wainwright to the strategic decision relieves counsel of the traditional responsibility to not only his client, but to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.345" offset="4332160">I think the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. Humphries summed it up very succinctly when they said that there is a traditional relationship between court and counsel which enjoins upon counsel the duty to raise an issue before the court rather than to, by its silence, lead it into commission of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.664" offset="4429440">I'd also point out that our argument does depend upon the ultimate success or lack of success in raising the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.909" offset="4470504">The phrasing in Wainwright v. Sykes is that if a person thinks that the actions of the trial court are about to deprive it of constitutional error, then he has a duty to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.133" offset="4571337">Not that he knows that the actions of the trial court are about to deprive him of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.396" offset="4588369">I would refer the court to Judge Poole's dissenting opinion in Myers v. State of Washington which is cited in our reply brief, because I think he very succinctly points out our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.377" offset="4628284">He refers to the question of whether or not counsel would have raised the question as a murky epistemology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.843" offset="4666214">Who is to say what factor will set off the creative light bulb that will lead to new development in the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.696" offset="4709577">It could be the creation of a new statute, it could be a development in another state, it could be the pendency of a case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.350" offset="4740193">It could be any one of numerous factors, and I think that if you apply a "would have raised" you're merely stating a result and not a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.565" offset="4785123">It's obvious here that the attorneys did not object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.625" offset="4805290">There's no explanation offered as to why, and there's no argument made that they could not have raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.465" offset="4836637">I think our distinction flows directly from Wainwright v. Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.508" offset="4876865">I think them major premise of that decision is that once counsel is either retained or appointed for a criminal defendant, that the whole range of strategic and tactical decisions is entrusted to that counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.971" offset="4946664">I also think that the result is fully justified by the state's interest in finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.123" offset="4975295">There comes a point in time when society and the individual's interest in finality far outweigh any possibility of enhanced reliability on another trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.359" offset="10364251">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.701" offset="10373656">We believe this case presents two overriding issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.482" offset="10384731">First of all, may the state require an accused to prove his innocence by establishing that he acted in lawful self-defense, and second, should the procedural default rule that this Court last fully addressed in Wainwright v. Sykes, be extended to apply to errors which affect the integrity of the factfinding process and go to the very heart of the guilt/innocence determination process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.473" offset="10476682">I think that on its fact, these may appear to be substantive and procedural issues that you can separate, but I think if you look at them, they are intertwined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.940" offset="10498625">And I say that because I think the nature of the error itself is relevant not only to establishing the error occurred, but more importantly, to establishing that the Skyes principles at least by their own force do not apply to this case, and they're also relevant to determining cause and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.995" offset="10570828">I'd like to address the Sykes application, but I'd just like to make one response to some of the points that Mr. Karas made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.385" offset="10584411">He, in tracing the history of the case, he may have left the Court with the impression that there was an exhaustion issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.398" offset="10604369">I would simply point out that the lowe courts have found no question of exhausting state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.910" offset="10634462">I don't believe that that defense was ever asserted in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.441" offset="10636552">Also, it was indicated that the record before the court demonstrated there was no objection to these jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.563" offset="10661107">I think that's certainly true of Mr. Isaac's case, it's certainly true of my client, Mr. Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.891" offset="10674377">But as we indicated in the brief, there's no transcript before this Court, there's nothing in the record to indicate whether Mr. Bell's counsel did or did not object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.669" offset="10705515">Turning to the Sykes question, I think if we focus on Sykes, we see that in the line of cases beginning with Davis and going through Sykes, none of those cases dealt with the fundamental integrity of the guilt-determining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.570" offset="10753058">In Sykes, for example, we're talking about a voluntary... not even a voluntary issue... of a prophylactic rule under Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.569" offset="10773120">In none of those cases did we have the factual basis for the error in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.739" offset="10797780">I think this Court specifically, in Wainwright v. Sykes and in the course of the oral argument inquired about plain error, and the response was of course no, we didn't have a suppression hearing, so therefore, the factual basis wasn't there; therefore, it couldn't be plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.780" offset="10845949">And I think most importantly, both counsel for Wainwright as well as the United States who appeared as an amicus advocated the procedural default rule and in presenting that argument to the Court, they specifically disavowed any intent to apply that to any rule that would make a decision as to guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.975" offset="10918779">That's in marked contrast to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.771" offset="10925884">In this case, the state of Ohio told its juries if the state does not dis-prove self-defense, at least by the Robinson decision, then this man is innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.159" offset="10963500">It goes to the very heat of that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.564" offset="10973113">It made the whole difference here between an acquittal and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.734" offset="10989727">Also, the error is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.670" offset="11001535">We don't have to have an evidentiary hearing, we don't have to go back and make reconstructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.496" offset="11016790">I think it's also important to focus upon the nature of the error to this extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.839" offset="11030165">That in any other situation, a conscientious jury could still come back with a proper verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.805" offset="11054093">If the prosecutor comments on silence, I can ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.507" offset="11060885">If the prosecutor makes an inflammatory comment I can ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.179" offset="11071543">Even if an involuntary confession comes in I can ignore it as a juror based upon the very reasons that the trial judge would have excluded it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.207" offset="11103621">But in this case, a conscientious jury would have followed this erroneous statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.017" offset="11122847">And that's what makes... I'm sorry, the erroneous instruction, and that's what makes it so critical to the guilt or innocence determining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.671" offset="11149492">I think that where we end up at least with that is that Sykes, by its own terms, was not designed to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.448" offset="11180630">That we go back and we look to the fundamental nature of the error, and it should suggest that relief is available without ever reaching the Sykes question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.711" offset="11209678">With respect to the state law question, I think that we have to go back... and perhaps I could clarify just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.130" offset="11239353">The Poole case that my friend Mr. Karas makes reference to, is a 1973 Ohio Supreme Court case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.271" offset="11391909">I wouldn't say fundamental error as much as error that affects the accuracy of the factfinding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.050" offset="11415001">And I think that that's a very similar rationale to the test of retroactivity that this Court has developed, for example, in Hankerson, deciding whether to apply Mullaney v. Wilbur retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.796" offset="11458051">And I think what we have to look at is when we consider the jury, not just is this an error in and of itself, or even is it a constitutional error, but is this the type of error that raises serious questions about the accuracy of the jury in performing its function in making findings of fact and determining guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.288" offset="11523984">I think while we, I suppose, would have to go through a whole continuum of examples, I don't think there's any question that when the burden of proof is shifted, whether that burden of proof is required by state statute or is required by federal constitutional law, that that does impinge upon the varying--</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.549" offset="13433012">The only interest the state has here is finality, and we're suggesting to the Court that even finality, while it may be of considerable interest, could never alone outweigh the defendant's interest, when we have an error of this magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.591" offset="13481182">I think also there's been some discussion here of futility, and I'd point out particularly in favor of my client Mr. Hughes that we had a binding decision from the Ninth District Court of Appeals which is unreported but we've reproduced it in the addendum that we lodged with the clerk's office which interpreted the statute prior to Mr. Hughes' trial and said, in effect, the statute didn't change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.645" offset="13565401">The state's interest here is avoiding retrials, and all I'm suggesting to you is while futility is generally discussed in terms of cause, we would like the Court to focus here on futility in terms of the adequacy of the state grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.297" offset="13608033">If the judge, in theory, could not have given that instruction, it serves no purpose to raise the objection and it becomes futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.825" offset="13634155">And just as we don't require futile acts under the exhaustion requirement which is comity-based, neither should we require futile acts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.651" offset="13657456">Of course, as we've also tried to indicate in our briefs, if the Court goes beyond the adequacy of the state grounds, finds it adequate, wants to look to cause and prejudice, we think that we've demonstrated cause and prejudice here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.193" offset="13699566">I'd also point out that we have some... both of these individuals filed their petitions pro se in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.347" offset="13736242">The district court cited those decisions... I guess I did enter one of those cases after the magistrate's recommendation... but decided those cases without any type of evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.966" offset="13782740">And the only reason I think that that is relevant here is that this Court seems to suggest in its recent case in Jenkins v. Anderson that in order to resolve a cause type of question, there may be a necessity for an evidentiary hearing, and none was held in any of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.132" offset="13843344">So I'm suggesting to the Court that I think the record here is clear enough under all these facts that we've demonstrated cause without that hearing, but if the Court were to determine otherwise, then we'd suggest that perhaps one of the proper remedies would be to remand for an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.254" offset="13883886">I think it's also important to point out, in terms of assessing what counsel's opportunity was, that the only two opinions that speak directly to these points are from the judges closest to what was happening in the state of Ohio come from the Second District Court of Appeals in Ohio; again, an unreported case, State v. Hamilton and it's in the addendum, where they characterized this that objecting would have been a vain act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.307" offset="13976046">And also, Judge Peck, senior status on the Sixth Circuit who authored the plurality decision, who was a former Ohio common pleas judge and also former Ohio Supreme Court judge, and he, too, looking at this said in the context of these cases, it would have been vain or it would have been futile to make this objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3781.211" offset="15263673">I think that is what gives rise to the court of appeals' argument about presumed prejudice, and the only point that I would make there is a quote from Davis v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.206" offset="15307664">"The presumption of prejudice, which supports the existence of the right, is not inconsistent with the holding that actual prejudice must be shown in order to obtain relief from a statutory waiver for failure to assert it in a timely manner.

            <text syncTime="3808.778" offset="15373910">The third thing is State v. Abner I would assert actually supports the state's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.042" offset="15386971">The court there held that there need not be a specific instruction on the state's burden to prove the absence of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.319" offset="15428140">The argument there would be that if it were an element of the offense, that would constitutionally be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.222" offset="15451755">The only counter-argument that the respondents have made is that the Ohio Supreme Court was acting unconstitutionally there as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.923" offset="15482475">And the last thing is that the distinction of how you separate the claimed state error here from any other claimed state error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.981" offset="15522704">If the state has a speedy trial act that is more restrictive than what would be required by the constitutional claim of speedy trial, can a habeas corpus petitioner raise the failure of Ohio to have abided by the state supreme court act, the state speedy trial act or anything other of the myriad range of decisions by which state courts actually go beyond what is fundamentally required by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.094" offset="15639210">I just ask the Court to note that the Hughes case provides writ granted on the basis of Isaacs; I expect that if this decision is upheld you will have writ granted Isaacs, writ granted Isaacs, and I have asked the Court to spare the state of Ohio this tragedy.</text>
