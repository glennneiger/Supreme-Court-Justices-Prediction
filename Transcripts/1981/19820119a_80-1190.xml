            <text syncTime="69.660" offset="413349">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case, like the last one, involves the question whether a seniority system is protected by Section 703(h), but the issues that are before this Court are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.420" offset="476356">This is a pre Act system.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.989" offset="482730">No one disputes that it is a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.943" offset="502479">And indeed, no one disputes that the ultimate outcome of this case turns on the resolution of a single dispositive question of fact, that is, whether this system was negotiated or maintained with a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.971" offset="574577">The issues that are before this Court relate not to the meaning of 703(h) as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.458" offset="600595">That is something which is common ground in both lower courts and with all the parties in amici, but rather, with the... the respective roles of district courts and courts of appeals in making the factual determination of discriminatory purpose, and with a methodology that the Fifth Circuit has sought to impose, both on the district courts and on itself, for treating with the evidence that bears on the resolution of that factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.744" offset="721698">Now, this case was before the district court in successive trials that amounted to 19 days, in which his focus throughout was principally on the seniority system, and he had in addition to 19 days of testimony, a mass, literally a mass of documentary evidence, and on the basis of that the district court found as fact that the seniority system in this case, a system which provided that departmental seniority would be the measure of seniority for layoffs, recalls, and promotions, had not been adopted with a discriminatory purpose, and had not been maintained with a discriminatory purpose, and he cited a number of subsidiary findings, if you will, that led him to that ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.993" offset="922737">First, this system was neutral on its face, made no distinction on the basis of race, and was in fact applied equally to blacks and whites throughout its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.718" offset="969548">Second, he found the system was essentially the product of the union's aims and policies at that plant, not the company's.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.490" offset="1000686">He found that at each stage in its development it was the union that was making the demands for particular seniority features, and that the features that emanated from bargaining were those that the union had sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.631" offset="1053244">He therefore thought it particularly important to look at the attitudes of that union on questions of race and the roles that blacks and whites respectively played within that union in determining its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.391" offset="1108310">He found that this was a union rather unique in Alabama in the early 1940s that pursued colorblind objections... objectives, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.246" offset="1151674">He found that the work force at this particular plant was roughly half black at all times, that blacks had been a major force, indeed the major force in organizing the union, that blacks had at all times been actively involved in the leadership of the union, holding officer positions, holding a majority of the shop steward positions, that blacks at all times had been on the union's negotiating committee, had participated in negotiating the very seniority system in question, indeed, had proposed many of the very elements of the system that were under question in the negotiation, that each element of the system when negotiated was brought back to the membership for approval at membership meetings in which blacks and whites participated equally, both in speaking about the system and in voting on it, that the votes on the seniority system had never divided along racial lines, and he made two ultimate conclusions about the role of this union that had negotiated this system.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.494" offset="2268670">Your Honor, there is no doubt that but for the Section 703(h) and the decision in Teamsters, there is an injury suffered by people by reason of pre Act discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.070" offset="2319034">It happens to be much less here than in most cases, because here the hypothetical Your Honor gave, that you were eight steps below, doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.574" offset="2349022">Here there were no lines of progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.259" offset="2355814">That was one of the very important things the district court pointed out as evidence of innocent motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.080" offset="2379011">Here, everyone was told, promotions from now on within this department will be on the basis of departmental seniority, without any lines of progression, so that a black who had been in that plant longer, even though he had been assigned to the bottom job, or the lowest paying job... there was no bottom job as such in the department... would be free to use that seniority to claim any job in that department that he wished the minute a vacancy arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.278" offset="2483814">In other words, this... the design of this system was found by the district court to be positive evidence of innocent motivation, because although many people for non discriminatory reasons, in all white plants, for example, where race couldn't be a factor, do in fact develop lines of progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.954" offset="2550583">There is nothing inherently vicious about lines of progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.423" offset="2564376">In fact, this system didn't contain those.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.775" offset="2573780">This system contained a much quicker route of access to repair the damage that had been wrought by the company's initial acts of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.333" offset="2616098">Now, beyond these features, the company cited two others.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.367" offset="2628219">The company looked at... I am sorry, the district court looked at the two components of this system about which complaints had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.640" offset="2661238">The first of those was, this is a departmental seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.842" offset="2678061">The measure of seniority is how much time have you been in the department, and the plaintiffs allege that the court should find that the parties' choice of that measure of seniority was badly motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.667" offset="2729365">And the court said, I have nothing to support such an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.971" offset="2746606">On the contrary, every plant in America of this size and with this disparity of jobs is either a departmental seniority system or a narrower one.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.278" offset="2791850">The only kind of seniority system you can create that doesn't have the effect of disparate impact when a company has previously discriminated in assignments, is one that says, from now on, whenever any job in this plant opens up, no matter where it is, it will go to the most senior person in the plant who bids for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.858" offset="2874188">Now, that is the only kind of system that doesn't create disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.894" offset="2894355">But that kind of system didn't exist anywhere in America in a large plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.964" offset="2910550">It didn't exist because employers couldn't operate a plant that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.666" offset="2925388">They would be playing musical chairs every day, moving everybody around.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.884" offset="2938240">And it didn't exist because employees didn't want a seniority system like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.670" offset="2957362">There would be no stability whatever in your job.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.755" offset="2965721">You wouldn't know from day to day where you were going to work in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.990" offset="2978678">So that there was no such thing as the only kind of seniority system that would not have disparate impact, and what that meant was, and this was the point the district court found absolutely most important in his analysis, what that meant was, when a union organized a plant, a large plant where the employer had historically discriminated, and that discrimination was still manifested in the placement of people in the plant, it was not conceivable that innocently motivated parties would have negotiated a system that would not have disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.179" offset="3123396">To choose to have a seniority system meant that you were going to have a system that had disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.400" offset="3152340">Now, I suppose one could say, well, the fact that these parties chose to have a seniority system of any kind is evidence of bad motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.839" offset="3186090">If they hadn't been badly motivated, they wouldn't have chosen to have a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.641" offset="3201241">But we know that can't be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.577" offset="3209078">This Court has said seniority systems are universal in American industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.980" offset="3226632">Every union upon negotiating every plant, the first thing it wants, even before a wage increase, is a seniority system, because that is the most important things that employees want for job equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.852" offset="3270100">And it is not possible in the face of a history of discriminatory assignments to negotiate however innocently a seniority system that doesn't have a disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.744" offset="3317747">Now, it happens that among the choices that innocently motivated people in plants make, if you look at all white plants where race couldn't be a factor, in the north, there are a number of kinds of systems people could adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.785" offset="3365917">They could adopt a job seniority system with a line of progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.253" offset="3379710">They could adopt line of progression seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.938" offset="3394443">The widest kind of seniority anybody ever adopted anywhere was departmental seniority without lines of progression, the very thing which these parties negotiated here, right in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.698" offset="3453479">So these parties adopted the broadest system of seniority that had the least disparate impact of any conceivable system they might reasonably have been expected to choose, and the district court said, how can I find bad motive when I find these parties adopting what is in fact the broadest possible system anybody could have been expected to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.730" offset="3545639">Now, that, I think, indicates what is the danger of placing undue emphasis on evidence of disparate impact in measuring seniority systems, and this would be true of a post Act system as well, if the union came along tomorrow and organized a plant that still had the effects of an employer's historical discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.493" offset="3632679">Simply to choose to have a seniority system is to create something that will have disparate impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.189" offset="3703523">When you say what test, he said the question before me is, were the parties motivated by a racial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.144" offset="3735288">That was his test.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.560" offset="3740931">He derived that test from Teamsters, and foreseeability, Teamsters eliminated as an element in the inquiry foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.166" offset="3775412">Now, it is always true if a union comes on a plant that has had disparate assignments, to choose to have a seniority system will foreseeably have a disparate impact, but what Teamsters said is, that the is the very thing Congress wanted to protect in 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="926.259" offset="3839778">It knew that it was foreseeable that any seniority system would have those effects, and it wanted to say, because it wanted to protect seniority systems, that notwithstanding that it was inevitable that those systems would have that effect, we want to protect those systems, and we will not invalidate them, as this Court also said in Feeney, in the Fourteenth Amendment context, and it said it again in Teamsters in the Title 7 context, we will only allow the invalidation of those systems that were set up because of, not in spite of their disparate impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.817" offset="3985959">So that if you find that these parties designed the system for the purpose of hurting blacks, or fencing them out, or whatever, that system will not be protected, but if these parties with innocent purpose set up the same seniority system they would have set up if everybody were white, or everybody were black, that is to say, a system which was not shaped by racial purpose, then the mere fact that that system has a continuing effect because of the company's independent discrimination will not invalidate that system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.544" offset="4152934">But the law certainly did not require us to do that, and in this plant that was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.365" offset="4176235">We don't tell them we're sorry, Your Honor, but when you say we tell them we're sorry, this seniority system as the district court found,</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.769" offset="4205806">"has been negotiated by blacks no less than whites. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.939" offset="4226495">and that is a finding which the court of appeals did not dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.458" offset="4240601">Blacks had an absolutely equal voice in this system, and for whatever reason, in more recent years, when the company proposed merging lots of departments, an event which would in fact have created the opportunity to use seniority more broadly, the record evidence is undisputed, and the district court found that was unanimously rejected by the employees with the efforts to reject it led by the minority employees, who said, sure, there are some advantages, and increased mobility, but there are also disadvantages, in that others are going to have increased mobility vis a vis us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.166" offset="4387409">That was a choice made by all the employees, not for racial reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.785" offset="4401829">It was made by blacks and whites together, because this is the seniority system they thought would work best in their plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.789" offset="4429832">Now, the court of appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.224" offset="4443625">And it reversed saying, we find that there was a discriminatory purpose here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.846" offset="4470061">And there are three features of that reversal that I think are important to focus on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.615" offset="4489182">First, while all the parties had assumed that what the court of appeals said is this entire system that the Steelworkers negotiated is invalid, the choice of departmental seniority, departmental structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.125" offset="4539233">That is certainly what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.141" offset="4543308">They said, the system is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.474" offset="4552608">The government has come along in an amicus brief and said, oh, no, that... it is true that literally that is what it seems to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.597" offset="4589075">That can't be what the court of appeals meant to say, because the reasoning of the court couldn't possibly get you that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.430" offset="4600464">All it meant to say is that that tiny component of the system which was impacted by this other union, the Machinists, racial motivation in giving 24 jobs to the Steelworkers, was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.237" offset="4647693">Nothing else is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.672" offset="4653440">Now, whichever of those is the correct interpretation of the court of appeals opinion, the court of appeals committed the two errors that we have brought before this Court for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.378" offset="4692206">First, it is the rule of the Fifth Circuit, not just in seniority cases, but applied in Title 7 cases wherever discriminatory purpose is the issue, it is the rule of the Fifth Circuit that Rule 52A does not apply to our review of a district court finding on discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.876" offset="4770260">Oh, it applies to the subsidiary findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.042" offset="4778932">If this Court found, for example, that blacks participated in the vote, we have got to accept those findings unless they are clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.231" offset="4807667">But what they call the ultimate fact, and what I would say when discriminatory purpose is the dispositive fact, we will make an independent factfinding on that issue free of the clearly erroneous rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.157" offset="4875377">Now, the first issue we have brought before the Court is... and this Court granted cert on this last year in Berdeen and then didn't reach it, and has granted cert on it again this year... the first thing we bring before this Court is that the Fifth Circuit is usurping powers that it does not have in reviewing factfinding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.203" offset="4943504">Nobody is here to defend the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.036" offset="4954893">Neither the plaintiffs nor the government defends their assertion that Rule 52(a) doesn't apply, and that is not surprising, because this is not an open issue in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.510" offset="4996794">This Court has four times held that when motive is the dispositive factual question in a case, the court of appeals must review that finding on the basis of Rule 52(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.345" offset="5936157">This was as case with 19 days of trial testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.697" offset="5945561">But even in documentary cases, this Court has said that where all the evidence is undisputed, the inference to be drawn when it is the dispositive fact is to be drawn by the district court and is to be reviewed under Rule 52(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.691" offset="6001463">There is not to be de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.107" offset="6011181">This Court has repeatedly said that, and we have cited those cases in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.761" offset="6029780">So that I won't go through... we have done it in our brief... the reasons why this limited scope of review has been provided, but there is no question, this Court has definitively decided enumerable times that the standard of review the Fifth Circuit is now applying is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.204" offset="6091533">Now, the other issue that comes here is that the Fifth Circuit, after having assumed this responsibility of independent factfinder, proceeded to apply the so called James factors as its methodology for resolving that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.816" offset="6154018">Now, the James factors carry with them two kinds of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.434" offset="6168438">The first problem is, they list four factors that are relevant, and Number Four happens to be whether the system has a... was negotiated or maintained with a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.576" offset="6213055">Well, since we know that that is the only question under Teamsters, the fact that there are three up there before it has an intrinsic potential for creating three additional tests that a seniority system must meet, and indeed, that is the way it effectively works in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.203" offset="6283586">Our position is that there ought not to be any elevation of particular items of evidence as the most important items to find discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.643" offset="6325277">As this Court in a quite different context held in Commissioner versus Duberstein, cited in our brief, when there is a factfinding to be made, the district court should make it from all the evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.284" offset="6371879">This Court should not declare certain facts shibboleths which are automatically to be touchstones of a ruling one way or the other, and that is in essence what the Fifth Circuit is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.591" offset="6413048">It would be wrong to do that even if the three touchstones they cited were particularly probative, but in fact they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.245" offset="6443664">The first is impact, and as I have already talked, and I won't go through that again, impact is a very unreliable indicator of the motive of a seniority system, where the company has historically discriminated, because if the parties chose any system at all, it was going to have bad impact, and that doesn't mean the parties were badly motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.723" offset="6525584">The degree of impact is going to be a product of how badly the employer discriminated in assignments, not how meanly the parties designed their seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.765" offset="6561737">We have talked in our brief, in our reply brief, rather, about the other two, and shown why they likewise are not reliable indicators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.918" offset="6594443">So there ought not to be a hierarchy of evidentiary points at all, but if there were one, it should certainly not include the three that the Fifth Circuit has made dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.124" offset="6631223">And what they did here, they reversed the district court, ignoring this mountain of evidence that he had that it seems to us convincingly showed this system was innocently motivated, because that evidence in their scheme wasn't to be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.384" offset="6688275">They had their three little touchstones, impact, the employer was engaging in other discrimination at that time, and there were some differences between this system and the system at the company's northern plant, all of which the district court explained, it seems to us, quite convincingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.793" offset="6749923">So, we suggest that for both of these reasons, the Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed, and I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.075" offset="6834978">Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court, some 15 years ago, less than two years after the passage and the effective date of Title 7, black employees at the Pullman-Standard Company filed charges of discrimination with the EEOC, seeking their rightful place in the employment picture of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.655" offset="6921391">Last year, it became painfully clear that the rightful place would never be achieved, as the company permanently closed the doors of its Bessemer, Alabama, plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.313" offset="6967994">Today, this Court must decide whether all relief is barred for the affected class of black employees, as it gropes with the question of whether the seniority system at Pullman-Standard adopted at a time when racial discrimination was pervasive, and it pervaded every aspect of the life of the company, and was maintained from its genesis in 1941 until the plant closed in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.613" offset="7073215">All during this period, racial discrimination at the company was still the order of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.719" offset="7105607">And this Court must decide whether that system is nonetheless protected by the narrow immunity afforded to good faith seniority systems under Section 703(h).</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.896" offset="7174361">I just wanted to emphasize that pervasive, intentional racial discrimination was the order of the day at the time this system was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.204" offset="8751530">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.852" offset="7202155">Now, let's move to the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.721" offset="7217620">The seniority system in this case is the system which was negotiated by the company, Pullman-Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.909" offset="7254400">That system involves seniority rules and two bargaining units, the Machinists and the Steelworkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.265" offset="7291808">It is not the Steelworkers negotiated system or the Machinists negotiated system that plaintiffs are... that respondents are challenging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.223" offset="7335589">We are saying that the seniority system negotiated by Pullman-Standard, by the company, the system the employee faces when he walks into the door, is the system that we challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.031" offset="7382818">Now, that system has these two component parts, and the component parts of this system are interrelated in their genesis and adoption, and in their cumulative impact on black employees at Pullman-Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.973" offset="7442586">The company simultaneously negotiated both parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.277" offset="7459827">During the genesis of the system in 1941 and '42, the bargaining units, the Machinists and the Steelworkers, negotiated with each other as well as with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.133" offset="7499220">Three actors, the company, the Steelworkers, and the Machinists, adopted, designed, and maintained the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.823" offset="7537986">Now, what respondents complain of is their inability to make interdepartmental transfers within the Steelworkers unit, and the loss of seniority, and their inability to transfer into the Machinists unit without carryover seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.986" offset="7618652">Now, the district court committed three principal legal errors which flawed its analysis of bonafideness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.925" offset="7654387">First, at the heart of our claim that this particular departmental system is not bona fide lies the racial manipulation and gerrymandering of the departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.351" offset="7708095">Each time departmental seniority was adopted, the number of one race departments increased, and the racially stratified departmental structure upon which the seniority system was grafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.675" offset="7765460">Much of this racial maneuvering along department lines and along bargaining unit lines occurred during the NLRB certification process just prior to the adoption of seniority at the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.185" offset="7823452">The district court erred in determining as a matter of law that certification of the bargaining units by the NLRB was insulated from 703(h) review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.844" offset="7874129">Second, the district court deemed irrelevant as a matter of law the motives of one of the principal architects of the system, the Machinists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.002" offset="7926688">Also, as a matter of law, the district court determined that evidence of adverse economic impact of the seniority system on blacks was irrelevant to a determination of bonafideness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.794" offset="7977888">Now, there are other areas in which the district court made legal error which I won't go into at this point, but one is, the court also determined that NLRB certification of the bargaining units insulated the transparent facial irrationality of the system, because what we have is a Machinist, an all white Machinist bargaining unit which excluded blacks by reason of race, with its seniority system, and it was able to get the all black bargaining unit through entering into an agreement with the Machinists, and the IAM system has two departments, the Machinists, the IAM system, the Machinist system, has two departments; the Steelworkers system has 26 departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.893" offset="8174328">The two IAM departments are all white departments culled from departments which were in... which were previously racially mixed departments before unionization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.950" offset="8218528">The court of appeals was absolutely correct in its conclusion that the seniority system was not bona fide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.788" offset="8249875">Now, it is important to review for purposes of our argument the context in which the court of appeals reached its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.910" offset="8282371">Arlington Heights tells us to look at the historical background in which a decision was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.198" offset="8303478">The company negotiated seniority rules at Pullman-Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.935" offset="8322495">It was the only actor who negotiated every seniority rule in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.089" offset="8347050">From the time it opened its doors to do business in Bessemer, Alabama, in 1929, it racially stratified the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.825" offset="8377979">There were black jobs, white jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.194" offset="8387488">It had some all white departments, some all black departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.146" offset="8403266">It had racially disproportionate departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.015" offset="8414759">Special badge numbers for blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.450" offset="8424477">All memos and records indicated the race, "col" beside the names of blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.739" offset="8453734">It had segregated facilities at this plant until 1967, the same year EEOC charges were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.929" offset="8486439">Now, we have in 1941 the Steelworkers and the Machinists together coming to the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.083" offset="8511099">The Machinists as part of their ritual excluded blacks as a matter of both policy and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.736" offset="8537639">With regard to the petitioner Steelworkers, the history of its International Union is not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.806" offset="8565956">What is at issue here are the policies and practices of Local 1466 of the Steelworkers unit, which was a certified bargaining agent at this particular plant in Bessemer, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.364" offset="8612141">The local practiced extensive segregation of the races.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.750" offset="8625724">The local had segregated seating at the union hall until the first trial of this case in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.320" offset="8652056">Segregated facilities until the EEOC charge was filed in this case, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.874" offset="8674208">Blacks were told to stay in the black jobs and sit on the black side of the union hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.611" offset="8693120">Now, true, blacks were not excluded from Local 1466, as they were from the Machinists local, but blacks certainly had their place in the Steelworkers local, and that was stamped with a badge of inferiority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.821" offset="8754038">Now, also, the practices of the local Steelworkers was a matter of choice, not a matter of custom and practice, because in another case before this Court, Terrell versus U.S. Pipe, which is here on other issues, there was a Steelworkers local also in Bessemer, Alabama, during the same period in which the Fifth Circuit absolved the liability because of their exemplary racial practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.987" offset="8854661">Now, Arlington Heights indicates a sequence of events may provide some evidence of discriminatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.925" offset="8886426">There are two periods critical to development of this seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.877" offset="8906279">First is the period 1941-42.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.781" offset="8921848">The second critical period is the period 1952 through '54.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.733" offset="8941701">We detail in our brief the record evidence and by the way, it was not a 19-day trial on the issue of bona fides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.706" offset="8985587">There was a three hour hearing in which the evidence was documentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.777" offset="9009829">This case was remanded in light of Teamsters, and it was a documentary case put on before the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.066" offset="9050998">The only witnesses at the hearing were two witnesses called by respondents where credibility was not at issue, but the seniority documentation in this case and the record is all documents, and anything that was referred to in an earlier trial is still documentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.628" offset="9133231">There is no testimony that goes to the question of bona fides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.931" offset="9154443">Also, I invite the Court to look at the memorandum opinion of the district court judge at Appendix 46-47 when he granted a hearing in light of Teamsters on bona fides, and he made it clear that the theory during the trial was perpetuation, and now submit evidence on the question of bona fides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.845" offset="9234064">Now, we detail in our brief the record evidence that leads to the virtually inescapable inference of intent regarding the IAM's exclusion of blacks from its bargaining unit, how at the representational hearing in 1941-42, how it maneuvered jobs based on race and not job function, how it hop skipped over jobs based on the race of the job incumbent, how the IAM selected a patchwork quilt of production and craft jobs, and excluded any blacks that were in production jobs but included whites that were in related production jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.272" offset="9407830">Now, the Machinists also represented both craft and production jobs until the close of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.194" offset="9435520">Now, at the hearing, the Machinists attempted to exclude all blacks but was not completely successful because the Machinists bargaining unit was certified and included some blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.120" offset="9495184">When NLRB certified the union it included some blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.072" offset="9506991">But the Machinist was able to rid itself of all of the blacks in its bargaining unit when it entered into an agreement with the Steelworkers where they swapped employees based on the race of the employee, and then went back to the NLRB for another certification one month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.249" offset="9575746">Now, these racial maneuverings during certification created five new one race departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.021" offset="9614825">Then, during the same period of time, contemporaneously, the company and the USW sat down and immediately drafted a departmental seniority system onto these racially stratified departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.630" offset="9677205">Again, the intent of the parties, especially the company, to keep blacks in these lower paying jobs and departments is manifested in 1954, when the Steelworkers readopted a departmental seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.909" offset="9742407">Just two months prior to the adoption of that departmental system in 1954, six new one race departments appeared on the seniority list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.884" offset="9790263">All of these one race departments were culled from previously racially mixed departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.586" offset="9813042">Now, in contemplation of a return to the departmental seniority system, the company created without a whimper of protest from the union, the Steelworkers, these six departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.846" offset="9866123">There is no explanation in the record why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.547" offset="9880960">What these departments do is further segregate the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.784" offset="9897888">Now, these... an example of how this... the system was maintained to continue this discriminatory intent may be determined by looking at one particular department, the dye and tool department at this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.281" offset="9983883">It was a racially mixed pre unionization department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.519" offset="10004781">That department, when the IAM and the company and the Machinists came in there, was split along racial lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.957" offset="10038531">The IAM took all of the jobs in which there were whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.259" offset="10059742">The dye and tool Steelworkers department had all the jobs in which there were blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.080" offset="10083043">That department, those departments were all black and all white until at least 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.019" offset="10118779">The company maintained the discriminatory... the assignment of these employees and maintained the seniority system by assigning employees in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.429" offset="10168412">The company could have assigned whites to the Steelworkers unit, but it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.333" offset="10192026">And so what we have is blacks and whites working together in the dye and tool department, but the blacks cannot use their seniority to get into the better jobs right there in dye and tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.771" offset="10237793">Maintenance is purposeful perpetuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.342" offset="10252108">The company maintained the segregative purpose of the seniority system, not only in dye and tool, but in every racially disproportionate department at the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.115" offset="10295158">Now, the discriminatory departmental assignments in this case, which is the law of the case before, during, and after the adoption of the departmental seniority system, is very strong evidence of an intent to discriminate entering the adoption and maintenance of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.361" offset="10380212">Departmental assignments in this case are not perpetuation, because perpetuation indicates inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.300" offset="10407902">This is deliberately using the system to keep blacks from accruing competitive seniority so that they might move into historically white jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.037" offset="10442906">Mr. Gottesman said, oh, well, blacks can use their seniority to move up into other white jobs, other jobs in the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.226" offset="10471641">Not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.176" offset="10475403">The departments are heavily racially disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.963" offset="10490554">They are either disproportionately white or disproportionately black, and you either have a disproportionately white department with whites in the better jobs, and a few blacks in that department clustered at the bottom.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.329" offset="13276043">The official administration of justice in these cases requires that the court of appeals be able to look at these cases, and especially if they are documentary, the 52(a) does not have the force that it has if the case were based on credibility of witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.178" offset="14107468">It is not our job here or anybody's, and certainly not the Court's, to retry the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.630" offset="14125231">It makes me somewhat reluctant to have to be up here defending ourselves on them, but there has been an effort to lay a glove on the Steelworkers' union, and they are quite sensitive about that, because back then there was a period when they had whites and blacks sitting on opposite sides of the meeting hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.007" offset="14190746">That is said to tarnish their colorblind objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.173" offset="14199419">As I am sure the Court realizes, that was something required by the laws of Bessemer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.161" offset="14219377">Indeed, it was a crime for a union or anybody else, for that matter, not to have people sitting on opposite sides, and the Court certainly can take judicial notice of what was the Bessemer City Code then, Chapter 34, Article 2, and the district court and the court of appeals, neither one of them thought that that impugned the district court's finding that this was a union that pursued colorblind objectives, sought to eliminate wage discrimination on the basis of race, and everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.812" offset="14325956">This business about manipulating departments is something the district court spent a lot of time on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.716" offset="14345600">Ninety-five percent of the people, black and white, were in departments that never changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.917" offset="14366394">They were set up long before there was a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.636" offset="14373290">They were the operational departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.102" offset="14379141">And for every one of the few changes that were made, there was a reason, and the court gave it, and it was a perfectly valid non racial reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.075" offset="14411011">And what is more, to think that the parties wanted to separate the races because they manipulated 5 percent of the departments when 95 percent of the people were in racially mixed departments just doesn't make any sense.</text>
