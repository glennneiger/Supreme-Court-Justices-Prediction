            <label>Mr. James H. Pipkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="95.244" offset="509611">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="99.680" offset="527270">I represent petitioner, Southern Pacific Transportation Company, a railroad common carrier involved in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.706" offset="559452">In essence, the action is an effort by the carrier to recover from the shipper or consignor... in this case, respondent Commercial Metals Company... freight charges incurred in transporting three separate carload shipments of steel cobble, which is a form of scrap steel, from Detroit, Michigan to southern California back in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.416" offset="654225">The dollar amount involved in these movements is small; it is less than $14,000 total.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.929" offset="680347">The legal issue presented is of great significance to the nation's railroads and motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.755" offset="707619">It is whether a carrier's right to recover transportation charges from a consignor can be barred by an implied remedy based on a violation of the ICC's credit regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.171" offset="757252">Or putting it another way, it is whether an equitable defense should be added to the credit regulations as an enforcement mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.526" offset="790688">The courts below found that the carrier violated the ICC's credit regulations with respect to all three shipments here involved, by delivering the first shipment without checking the credit worthiness of the consignee and by accepting checks which were later returned for insufficient funds, and one of which was for an amount less than that subsequently determined to be due.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.906" offset="888177">Though Southern Pacific contends that the actions with respect to the second and third cars do not violate the credit regulations, we concede a violation with respect to the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.371" offset="934048">So the question is what consequences arise from that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.838" offset="955991">And the courts below found that while Southern Pacific had made a prima facie case of a right to recovery from the consignor, the credit violation gave rise to an affirmative defense which barred collection of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.160" offset="1021193">The argument I would like to make this morning is basically twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.331" offset="1029865">It is first, that the lower court's decision is inconsistent with the purposes of the credit regulations as well as their language and history and 50 years of case law; and second, that the decision, if allowed to stand, will have serious adverse consequences to the nation's transportation system.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.073" offset="1256922">There is no information that is available that really would give an overall percentage of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.257" offset="1297568">I understand in the case of Southern Pacific it is something like one-third.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.395" offset="1322123">I couldn't hear Justice Stevens's question and I may be repeating, but what is the status... does the record show the status of the Southern Pacific's suit against Carco?</text>

            <label>Mr. James H. Pipkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="308.719" offset="1363501">The record doesn't show the status.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.016" offset="1376667">It shows that the summons and the complaint were unable to be served, both by special processor who were hired by the carrier, and subsequently by the Marshall's office of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.526" offset="1426718">No service was ever made, and in fact, the record shows that the carrier was unable even to track down the consignee through the Secretary of State's office of the state of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.817" offset="1475828">So all that the record really shows is that service was unable to be obtained, and that the consignee effectively vanished.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="347.032" offset="1516683">Were the goods ever paid for?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_pipkin_jr" startTime="350.656" stopTime="414.317">
            <label>Mr. James H. Pipkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="350.656" offset="1531208">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.233" offset="1537477">That was the answer to Mr. Justice Stevens' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.482" offset="1554509">The consignor is the party that requests the transportation service and selects the consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.243" offset="1601529">And the consignor fills out a bill of lading, which is the basic contract between the consignor and the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.895" offset="1632145">Its terms are described by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and unless the bill of lading explicitly provides to the contrary, the consignor is presumed to be primarily liable for the freight charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.344" offset="1681986">The consignor has the option, however, of disclaiming liability for the charges by executing the so-called "non-recourse clause" that appears on the face of the bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.541" offset="1726708">If the consignor fails to sign the non-recourse clause, it becomes primarily liable for the freight charge, and the carrier knows that if he is unable to collect from the consignee, he can then turn to the consignor for payment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="414.317" stopTime="426.422">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="414.317" offset="1785849">What is the practical effect of the non-recourse clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="419.736" offset="1807583">What incentive does the consignor have not to sign it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_pipkin_jr" startTime="426.422" stopTime="702.467">
            <label>Mr. James H. Pipkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="426.422" offset="1834228">Well, that involves the business relationships essentially between the consignor and the consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.217" offset="1861500">Any consignee would rather receive goods on credit, and most goods do move on credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.508" offset="1902669">Approximately 95 % of the goods in interstate freight transportation move on credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.600" offset="1922940">If the consignor signs the non-recourse clause which says that he is not liable for payment, the carrier is then more likely to deliver that shipment to the consignee on a COD basis, unless he knows the consignee well and has dealt with him in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.780" offset="1999740">The consignee clearly would rather not have that situation arise, and if he has two prospective sellers of goods, one of which will not sign the non-recourse clause and one which does, he would rather get the goods from the consignor so it will arrive on a credit basis rather than COD.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.709" offset="2083436">But that is really a business judgment and it involves, to some extent, almost whether it is deemed insulting to the consignee to receive it on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.657" offset="2135263">But in any event, the continuing liability of the consignor who does not sign the non-recourse clause is clear from the language of the bill of lading and clear under the case law for the last 60 years, and in fact, as this Court has expressly recognized that in the Illinois Steel case cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.274" offset="2213735">The cases also indicate that under the Interstate Commerce Act, the carrier has a duty to collect the freight charge, and if he cannot collect it from the consignee, he must try to collect it from the consignor.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.080" offset="2276951">Allowing a violation of the credit regulations to be used as a bar against collection from the consignor would be inconsistent with those cases and the essential purposes that they endorse.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.637" offset="2327106">Apart from the contract, the principal reason for our position basically is the statute and the regulations are part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme, and they are totally silent on any affirmative defense arising from violation of the credit regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.350" offset="2386039">And I would like to speak just for a second about the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.426" offset="2398264">The credit regulations can be traced back to 1918 during the first World War when the Director General of the railroads then issued something called General Order Number 25, which essentially put interstate freight transportation on a cash basis, with a few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.952" offset="2464406">The purposes are undisputed for taking that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.090" offset="2480915">They were to increase the working capital of the carriers by reducing the amount of freight charges that would be outstanding, owed by the consignees, and to reduce discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.758" offset="2531593">And when in 1920 the Congress enacted what became Section 3(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the issue here involved... that is the basis for the credit regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.269" offset="2569627">The continued that same policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.267" offset="2577673">Carriers were told that they could not deliver freight until the charges were paid, except under such rules and regulations as the commission should prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.608" offset="2614976">The same purposes were true, though... to protect the carriers and their working capital, and to prevent discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.684" offset="2643292">And the regulations adopted by the commission left a great deal of discretion to the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.588" offset="2666907">The main one is one that says that the carrier can extend credit for a specific period upon taking whatever precautions are deemed by it to be adequate to assure payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.333" offset="2709957">Those regulations are still in effect and have been for 61 years, they are enforced by the Interstate Commerce Commission primarily through a $5000 civil penalty, but also occasionally by cease and desist orders or injunctive proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.810" offset="2775785">And in this whole regulatory scheme there is no hint that a credit violation can be utilized as an affirmative defense, or that Congress intended that to be an enforcement mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.947" offset="2820403">And that engrafting such a defense on the regulatory scheme would in no way further the purposes of that scheme, which were to protect the carrier's working capital and to prevent discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.615" offset="2867005">In addition, the ICC has taken a very clear position on this same issue that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.220" offset="2893441">It has expressly said in the CGF Grain case that we cite in our briefs that a credit regulation... credit violation, excuse me... has no effect on a consignor's liability.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="702.467" stopTime="706.402">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="702.467" offset="2938476">We don't have any views of the ICC in this case, do we?</text>

            <text syncTime="707.417" offset="2958225">But we do have that clear expression of their view on the precise issue that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.353" offset="2977973">And the agency's interpretation, the agency that is responsible for promulgating the regulations and enforcing them is, we submit, entitled to great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.365" offset="3018097">And lastly, the decisions shortly after the credit regulations were issued uniformly rejected arguments that violations of the credit regulations barred recovery of the freight charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.359" offset="3070029">And we cite decisions particularly in 1924 and 1925 that raised exactly the same issue where state supreme courts rejected the same contention that is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.383" offset="3146097">The same thing had happened when the motor carrier credit regulations were promulgated at a later time than those that apply to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.899" offset="3152158">The courts considering that uniformly rejected estoppel as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.694" offset="3163338">For 50 years after that railroad credit regulation was issued, no court held that a violation could bar recovery of freight charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.336" offset="3305967">Now, we recognize that there are cases cited by Commercial Metals in this case, virtually all of which involve a situation where there is a consignee who has had some misrepresentation made to him by a carrier, and the result is that the consignee has relied on that misrepresentation and taken some detrimental action; and where the court has found that if payment were to be required, the consignee would have effectively paid twice.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.021" offset="3484644">What I would point out is that whatever the merits of those decisions, those cases do not turn on a violation of the credit regulations but rather on a misrepresentation by the carrier in detrimental reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.141" offset="3533128">And they involve a consignee, not a consignor, and the kind of situation that is addressed there cannot arise in the consignor context.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.668" offset="3571266">And there has been payment by someone at least in most cases of the full charge, albeit to the wrong person.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.180" offset="3597284">In only one aberrational case, prior to this one, has any court held that a consignor can take advantage of a credit violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.818" offset="3635841">All other cases have been resolved by enforcing payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.504" offset="3654649">And what we say is that in the fact of that history where the credit regulations have been interpreted consistently from the time of their promulgation through the next 50 years, this Court should not, in the 1980's, engraft a new affirmative defense upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.715" offset="3715462">The other reasons that we give for reaching that conclusion have to do with the consequences of the lower court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.651" offset="3743152">If the decision is upheld, one result, simple result, is the practical elimination of the non-recourse clause which has been in the bill of lading for 61 years and which obviously has been viewed as having some purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.176" offset="3801248">And I say that it will be practically eliminated because the credit regulations require that payment be made within five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.797" offset="3839805">If the shipper doesn't pay it within five days, technically a credit violation will have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.780" offset="3863733">And whenever the carrier then turns to the consignor, the consignor will be able to say well, you violated the credit regulations by not forcing payment within that five-day period, so in effect, it will make no difference whether the non-recourse clause is signed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.803" offset="3927785">Second and more importantly, more and more consignors and consignees will claim that they do not have to pay because of some credit violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.097" offset="3964984">There are several possible results to this, all of them we submit bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.485" offset="3986509">First, the carriers, as the amicus brief filed by the ATA and the AER indicate, may be forced to curtail extensions of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.872" offset="4032066">As I mentioned, 95 % of freight now moves on credit, and the amount of credit outstanding on shipments in any year is something like $25 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.445" offset="4070414">If a carrier knows that the consignor will no longer be liable for a charge if he is unable to collect from the consignee, the carrier will insist on payment COD in a much higher percentage of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.690" offset="4123390">This has a serious effect on the credit relationships; it also will impair efficient rail operations because it will result in cars having to sit there for a longer period of time until cash can be obtained from the consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.310" offset="4181800">And in addition, we suggest that the Court should not overlook the increased litigation that inevitably will occur in order to ascertain liability for freight charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.695" offset="4231328">The decision below will be read as saying that every violation of the credit regulations gives rise to an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.988" offset="4264556">That would be highly unfair, and even Commercial Metals does not go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.174" offset="4289320">When the ICC has reviewed the operation of the credit regulations from time to time, they have found that many violations occur, many violations are unavoidable, and that the majority of those violations are actually caused by shippers rather than carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.947" offset="4360373">And that is because of this situation where the ICC's jurisdiction is over the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.648" offset="4387227">The regulations are worded that payment must be received within five days, if it is properly extended in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.238" offset="4417529">Well, the carrier often doesn't have any control over whether that payment can be enforced or not from the consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.721" offset="4439472">So it clearly would be unfair to say that there is any kind of an estoppel situation in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.029" offset="4476670">So what Commercial Metals has done in this case is take the position that there is a fault standard which should be read into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.715" offset="4503420">They are basically saying that there should be an estoppel only when the violation is the carrier's fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.930" offset="4532259">But I suggest that that is part of a standard that raises many hard issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.741" offset="4551590">First of all, what is meant by fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.583" offset="4562874">Is negligence enough, or does the carrier have to take some action intentionally in order to violate the regulations or create some discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.987" offset="4600491">The regulations say, moreover, that before extending credit, a carrier must take whatever precautions it deems appropriate, so it leaves it essentially up to the carrier what precautions to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.528" offset="4650750">Well, if fault becomes the test, will there be some standard read into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.916" offset="4680217">Will the carrier be required to take some minimal precautions so that it is no longer up to him entirely what he should do, and what standards would be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.317" offset="4721908">Failure to pay within five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.144" offset="4733193">That is something that would not appear to be the fault of the carrier in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.392" offset="4754195">But if a court has to determine whether a failure to collect is a carrier's fault, can it impose some standard on the carrier to do something other than just sit there for those five days?</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.884" offset="5296079">But on that first shipment, there was no credit check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.680" offset="5307260">But the carrier in that case could have, as it did in the case of the second and third shipments, required a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.959" offset="5332442">That would not have violated the credit regulations, but the check would have bounced the same way the other two did, and it would have... the result would have been the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.079" offset="5384896">So we don't think there is a causal connection between those two events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.841" offset="5403913">So in addition to determining the tricky question of whether a violation has occurred, the courts, if the rule advanced by Commercial Metals were to prevail, would also have to grapple with this vague fault standard, applying it in particular factual situations and along the way, coming up with possibly some kind of substantive standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.690" offset="5507358">And since the dispute would be between two private parties, there would be no assistance from the agency that is charged with enforcing and promulgating the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.842" offset="5555945">And also, since many of the actions would be in state courts that might have their own different standards to apply in equitable estoppel cases, the result clearly will be not only increased litigation, but inconsistent results, and the result would be to take an issue that for the last 60 years has been characterized by certainty and uniformity and transform it into one where confusion and inconsistent results will probably prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.295" offset="6013820">And further, there is no need because the consignor already has the ability to protect himself, but wants this Court to create an additional remedy for him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.504" offset="12778594">In considering the carrier's plea for equitable relief in the Admiral case, the court said that it would not blind itself to the plaintiff's unlawful conduct in violating the credit regulations as enacted by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.325" offset="12829898">In that case, the defendant could not be charged as a matter of law with knowledge of the preface.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.838" offset="13027906">Referring to a previous decision of this Court in a case in which equitable estoppel defense was allowed, the Eighth Circuit in 1972 in the Southern Pacific Transportation Company v. Campbell Soup case specifically stated that we think it is equally plain, however, that this Court in the Fink decision, 1919 case, did not intend to impose a species of absolute viability upon consignees by ruling out the defense estoppel under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.950" offset="13156429">We think the critical question in this case is whether judicial recognition of an estoppel defense will contravene the anti-discriminatory purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.758" offset="13195612">The Fifth Circuit specifically found that that anti-discriminatory purpose was not contravened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.240" offset="13229572">We were not paid for any freight that we are holding and refusing to pay someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.486" offset="13254545">Forcing us to pay the carrier in this case would not benefit anyone except the carrier, and in fact, it would be obviously to our detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.512" offset="13302610">The trial court and the Fifth Circuit's opinion do not result in discrimination against any competitor of the shipper, nor did it discriminate against any locale or geographic region.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.898" offset="13352138">As found in the court below, the party guilty of granting the preference in this case was the Southern Pacific.</text>
