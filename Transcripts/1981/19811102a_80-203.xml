            <label>Mr. Richard P. Saslow</label>
            <text syncTime="69.925" offset="417508">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue presented is whether the Commodity Exchange Act provides persons such as the Currans an implied right to maintain a civil action for damages under Section 4, the antifraud provisions of the Act in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.078" offset="526177">In a broader sense, the issue is where is the line to be drawn that distinguishes between the proper scope of judicial function in the interpretation and application of statutory language, and what the Constitution defines to be the legislative prerogative, the enactment of substantive rights and federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.745" offset="640802">Very briefly, the facts are that the Currans opened a commodity trading account with Merrill Lynch in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.720" offset="680717">The account was closed about a year later, having sustained substantial losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.440" offset="703601">The Currans started suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, claiming civil damages alleged to have been suffered as a result of the fraud of Merrill Lynch.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.947" offset="757622">In the Court of Appeals, the Court addressed sua sponte and decided the issue of whether the statute creates this implied remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.757" offset="812897">Over the dissent of Judge Philips, the court concluded that there is such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.195" offset="842572">The Currans' claim is based on Section 4b of the Commodity Exchange Act, a 1936 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.634" offset="876427">The 1936 Act was broadly proscriptive, provided for criminal sanctions, and granted some regulatory powers to the Secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.776" offset="928985">There was no provision in that Act for any private remedy in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.280" offset="955003">There was no language in the statute creating such a right, and there was no indication anywhere in the legislative history that Congress ever considered, contemplated, or intended the existence of such a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.242" offset="1022817">The 1936 Act contained Section 4c, savings clause, which preserved to persons any rights or remedies they might have under applicable state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.466" offset="1075689">The Commodity Exchange Act was amended in 1968, very substantially in 1974, and again thereafter in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.224" offset="1126784">The 1974 amendment significantly broadened and strengthened the regulatory control of the government over this sector of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.832" offset="1165132">The 1974 amendments created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which was designed to be an expert agency with broad administrative, regulatory, and enforcement and remedial powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.774" offset="1228975">The Commission was vested with the oversight of contract markets, of the rules and regulations of the contract markets, was given power to enforce with cease and desist orders the terms of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.636" offset="1296371">It engages in the registration and licensing of persons active in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.474" offset="1323748">It has the power to revoke and suspend licenses and registration for violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.544" offset="1347989">The Commission has the power to impose civil penalties of up to $100,000, and to pursue criminal prosecutions, with penalties ranging up to $500,000 for, among other things, willful violation of the section at issue here, the antifraud provisions, Section 4b.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.357" offset="1427297">The 1974 amendments also repealed the state law savings clause, provided for exclusive jurisdiction over futures trading and related activities in the Commission, and also set up an administrative reparation procedure by which aggrieved persons such as the Currans could pursue a civil damage remedy before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.359" offset="1539310">The Act did not in 1936 nor in 1974 nor at any other time contain any language granting a person a right to sue for civil damages in the United States District Court alleging a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.405" offset="1615483">The Currans are asking in effect that the Court correct this Congressional oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.528" offset="1651950">They ask that the Court--</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Saslow</label>
            <text syncTime="523.635" offset="2232391">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Congress of the United States has since 1936 devoted considerable attention, time, effort, and draftsmanship to the creation of the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.500" offset="2327790">Yet the Respondents would ask this Court to disregard that Congressional effort in this very key provision and substitute the wisdom of this Court for that of the Congress as to whether this substantive right, this private right of action, should exist under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.997" offset="2413785">What Respondents ask in effect is for the Court to exceed its judicial function and venture into the realm of the legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.302" offset="2455059">This Court recently in Texas Industries versus Radcliffe Materials had occasion, speaking through the Chief Justice, to discuss the fact that the creation of substantive rights is a legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.812" offset="2517126">The Court noted that it is the Congress that is equipped to make these kinds of policy decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.268" offset="2550876">For example, in the consideration that preceded the enactment of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Congress heard testimony from witnesses representing many diverse segments within the futures trading industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.979" offset="2621720">This testimony, the hearings amounted to hundreds and hundreds of pages of legislative history, and represented the accumulation by the Congress of information, of the interests, the opinions, the desires of all of these many groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.059" offset="2710118">The decision of the Congress as to how those many and often diverse interests could best be balanced and mutually served, and how the futures industry and the national economy could best be served through this Act is set forth in the language, the provisions that the Congress put into the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.828" offset="2829132">The framers of our Constitution determined that such policy decisions are to be made by elected representatives, those who are politically accountable to their constituents.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.922" offset="2885557">The judicial forum is unsuited to the making of such policy decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.691" offset="2920561">Courts are limited to the facts presented to them by individual litigants in an adversary posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.464" offset="2951699">The Court does not have free ranging source of information to make such decisions.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="710.953" offset="2981687">Mr. Saslow, does Section 4b refer to the obligation of the FCMs toward third parties in the market generally, or only to their own customers?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_p_saslow" startTime="724.528" stopTime="800.378">
            <label>Mr. Richard P. Saslow</label>
            <text syncTime="724.528" offset="3035917">It does not direct their obligation to anyone in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.132" offset="3062353">It simply prohibits their committing fraud or deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.768" offset="3084923">I believe the focus of Section 4b is expressed in the 1936 enactment, and notwithstanding that the Respondents seek to look for Congressional intent in the 1974 amendments, it must be remembered that Section 4b was enacted in 1936, and has been on the books since that time, notwithstanding the amendment of other provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.390" offset="3211356">And in 1936, the Congress was focusing on the protection of farmers, producers, people who handle the commodities, to protect those people from the abuses of, among others, speculators.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.085" offset="3278229">The idea was the protection of the marketplace and of the agricultural segment of the economy from manipulation, excessive speculation, and other abuses in the futures market.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.541" offset="3427963">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.176" offset="3430575">The role of statutory construction traditionally involves the resolution of ambiguities in the statute, the efforts of the judicial branch to harmonize apparent conflicts between different provisions within a statute, or the task of harmonizing apparent conflicts between different statutes, and the application of the law to the facts of an individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.464" offset="3567666">Where, as in this case, the statute itself is clear, the Court need only consider the language and the structure of the Act to answer the question, and the answer to the question here is that there is no private right of action contained within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.845" offset="3641227">Therefore, none exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.078" offset="3650109">This Court's recent decisions have emphasized these limitations on the judicial role in the implication of private rights--</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.694" offset="4568574">This Court's recent decisions have stressed the limitations on the judicial role in the implication of private rights under statutes that don't expressly provide those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.271" offset="4626879">What this Court has said is that it cannot infer a private remedy under such a statute in the absence of clear, persuasive evidence that such was the intent of the Congress, yet the evidence that the Respondents rely on in this case is evidence of the sort that this Court has rejected as being probative of the existence of a private remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.586" offset="4728234">The Respondents argue that this is a comprehensive regulatory statute providing various means of enforcement and redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.210" offset="4770657">They argue further that it is the apparent will of the Congress to provide strong enforcement, and therefore it would advance that same Congressional purpose for the Court to imply an additional form of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.006" offset="4841815">This Court has, however, held otherwise, acknowledging that when there is a comprehensive, broad statute providing for varied remedies, it creates a presumption that the Congress knew what it was doing and enacted those remedies that it intended, and remained silent as to those remedies that it did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.537" offset="4935960">The Commodity Exchange Act at various provisions expressly provides for the jurisdiction of the United States Court to contribute to the enforcement of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.488" offset="5667806">This argument is unavailing for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.107" offset="5682226">The first of those reasons is that it is factually incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.993" offset="5697795">As I discussed a few minutes ago, the protection was directed to the marketplace in general, and to the extent there was any particular favored class, it was basically the farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.520" offset="5759966">The argument is also legally insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.141" offset="5778357">Even if people such as the Respondents were a favored class at whom the statute's benefits were aimed, that still is insufficient to create a substantive right to proceed in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.351" offset="5847215">The Respondents also seek to invoke the holdings of approximately four United States District Courts that recognize an implied right of action, using the tort pro se analysis of Rigsby and Borak, an analysis that this Court has since categorically rejected in Touche Ross and Transamerica.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.553" offset="5968006">It is argued that the Congress was aware of, approved of, and in effect adopted these decisions, and now this Court is debarred from taking that away since it is not said to represent a Congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.514" offset="6039895">This argument is factually incorrect and constitutionally unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.985" offset="6061733">It is factually incorrect because it is simply not supportable that the Congress as a whole was aware of, spent any time considering, or acted in reliance on the existence of a right found by these four courts in Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.232" offset="6142817">The decisions were constitutionally unsound and Congress was simply not well aware of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.170" offset="6178553">There are hundreds of pages of legislative history underlying the 1974 amendments, and there are a very few, very scattered, some ambiguous, some clearly perjorative references to these cases, but there is nothing that focuses on them and represents any Congressional intent recognizing this to be the law or establishing an intent that this shall be the law upon the adoption of these amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.022" offset="6293909">The District Courts cannot create substantive rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.620" offset="6580316">I think this Court has in recent terms held that that can't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.207" offset="6606647">What can constitutionally be done is for the Court to resolve ambiguities and infer in some cases a right of action even where none is expressly provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.117" offset="6662340">In Rigsby, for example, one of the provisions of the Safety and Appliance Act at issue in that case said that employees shall not be deemed to have assumed the risk.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Hudson</label>
            <text syncTime="2037.271" offset="8286948">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in making the determination of whether a private right of action exists under the Commodity Exchange Act, the opinions of this Court instruct that the touchstone is Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.265" offset="8342850">In this case, we submit that the relevant inquiry is whether Congress in enacting the substantive and extensive amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act in 1974 intended to deny a private right of action under Section 4b.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.974" offset="8409723">We believe this approach to be the correct one in view of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 1974 legislation, circumstances which show that based on the unanimous interpretation of Section 4b by the federal courts and based upon the testimony provided to Congress, and statements made by our legislators, Congress perceived that the Act afforded a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.477" offset="8523722">Thus stated, we believe that the opinion below did not, as this Court cautioned in Northwest Airlines versus United States, fashion a new rule or provide a new remedy which Congress decided not to adopt, but instead merely interpreted a statute as continuing an existing remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.040" offset="8601984">We believe the attempt to couch this case in constitutional terms is in fact to beg the very question that we have before the Court, and exalt the proper exercise of this Court's duty in interpreting a statute far beyond its plain import.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.583" offset="8672202">This Court has stated on numerous occasions that in construing a statute we look first to the statutory language, and particularly to the provisions made therein for enforcement and relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.076" offset="8722148">While as in nearly every case involving an implied right of action, there is no explicit statutory language which would answer this question for us, we believe the explicit terms of the statute are particularly telling of Congressional intent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.669" offset="8784528">Section 4b is a customer-oriented antifraud statute, very much like Section 10b of the Securities and Exchange Act, interpreted by this Court in Superintendent of Insurance, and Sections 206 and 215 of the Investment Advisors Act, considered in Transamerica Mortgage Advisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.648" offset="8856417">The very language of Section 4b makes it clear that a commodity broker's customers are the especial class intended to be benefitted by that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.455" offset="8903646">In Leist against Simplot, Judge Mansfield in his dissenting opinion correctly observed that it is only a customer who may bring a suit under Section 4b.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.894" offset="8941367">The express terms of the statute find significant support in the legislative history, which shows that customer protection was one of the, if not the overriding purpose of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.369" offset="8987343">However, as this Court has cautioned in California versus Sierra Club, the question is not simply whether... who would benefit, but whether Congress intended to confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.111" offset="9042304">As to this issue, the Petitioner and the Respondent are not in disagreement, because as Petitioner states in his brief, there is no reason for a court to speculate whether Congress intended that persons aggrieved by violations of the Act be entitled to recover damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.538" offset="9103953">Plainly, Congress did so intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.073" offset="9114089">And that intention is specified in the express terminology of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.144" offset="9134464">Sections 5a(11) and Section 14 of the Act create respectively a private, voluntary arbitration mechanism and an administrative reparations procedure to commodity customers injured for a broker's violation of Section 4b.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.755" offset="9204891">Thus, we believe the express terms of the statute, without regard to any other factors, conclusively demonstrate that Congress enacted a federal statute conferring federal duties upon commodity brokers toward their customers, and that Congress intended that customers would have recourse, civil recourse for violations of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.571" offset="9304156">Yet based upon the record as submitted to this Court, and we want to make that clear, the record supports, and we contend, that the claim of the Currans arose before the effective date of the reparations procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.046" offset="9358073">Under those facts, no remedy is provided to the Currans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.198" offset="9378657">Accordingly, the remaining inquiry of whether Congress intended that those rights to which I have referred would be supported through private litigation must be determined by reference to the language of the... not to the language of the statute, but through Congressional intent and the factors reflecting that intent, as this Court has outlined in Cort against Ash.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2331.964" offset="9465697">Is there any dispute about that with your opposition, as to whether there is a remedy for the Currans under this section?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_a_hudson" startTime="2339.385" stopTime="2452.408">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Hudson</label>
            <text syncTime="2339.385" offset="9495372">Justice Blackmun, I believe there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.504" offset="9507806">The comment has been made that possibly their claim arose during a time when they could use reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.907" offset="9529436">We contest that vigorously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.242" offset="9534765">I believe that it was correctly observed earlier that the Petitioners are suggesting that the Currans be sent to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.015" offset="9569873">They simply, in our view, cannot use reparations and they cannot use arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.483" offset="9587741">We believe, therefore, that it would be useful to take a look very quickly to what precisely Congress did in 1974 with the Commodity Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.291" offset="9631000">In 1974, 19 new sections were enacted; 27 sections were amended; and excluding the severability clause, only five sections were left undisturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.349" offset="9683245">Section 4b was one of the sections that was amended, yet the operative language upon which the Respondents rely was left completely intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.256" offset="9730892">The changes to the 1974 Act... in the 1974 legislation constituted a vast change in the scheme of legislation, and expansion of federal regulation, and in the means of providing redress for the violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.000" offset="9785854">So, we believe, based on that very extensive modification, that the intent to be discerned is the intent of the 1974 Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.856" offset="9821276">This is a point which every court which has considered this issue thus far has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.408" offset="9839457">In considering what the 1974 Congress intended with regard to claims like the Currans', we must recognize that when Congress sat down to amend the statute, it was the unanimous interpretation of the lower federal courts that a private right of action was allowed under Section 4b.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.971" offset="9917720">Petitioner is unable to point to one single decision that even suggests that that would not be an appropriate result.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2452.408" stopTime="2510.413">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2452.408" offset="9947500">Well, Mr. Hudson, in the case of Georgia against United States, decided about seven or eight years ago, where the Voting Rights Act was renewed, the Court's opinion states at Page 411, US at Page 526,</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.590" offset="10040182">"After extensive deliberations in 1970 on bills to extend the Voting Rights Act, during which the Allen case, which had been a matter of some controversy in this Court, was repeatedly discussed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.183" offset="10098592">"The Act was extended for five years without any substantive modification. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.820" offset="10117086">"We can only conclude, then, that Allen correctly interpreted the Congressional design when it held that the Act gives broad interpretation of the right to vote. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.860" offset="10157315">et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.326" offset="10159196">Now, was there that kind of discussion in the 1974 Congress?</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.413" offset="10179467">No, there was not, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.031" offset="10189916">In fact, the discussions in the 1974 Congress did not get into the specifics in terms of the cases that were decided, however, we believe that even without that, we believe that the conclusion which the Court reached in Cannon versus University of Chicago, which was that... the statement was made that our legislators are presumed to know the law, in addition to that general presumption, there was a significant amount of testimony which was presented and which we have outlined in our brief which shows that Congress was told that there was a right of action in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.472" offset="10335679">For example, a statement by Mr. Alvin Donohue, of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange, to the effect that the facts in large claims can best be established through the procedure--</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.785" offset="10413002">However, we believe that the emphasis which the Petitioner is trying to place on that very fact is... overlooks what we believe to be a very significant concept of statutory construction to which this Court referred to in Cannon, which is that it is not really the state of the law which is governing, it is Congress's perception of the state of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.567" offset="10508087">Whether or not that perception is correct or not is of no moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.202" offset="10522611">If Congress perceived that that private right of action existed, that in fact is the most significant indication of legislative intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2624.289" offset="10635042">I think that the AMTRAK decision and the very, I believe, cogent questions that you are pointing out must be considered, but I think they must be considered in the context of the entire circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.862" offset="10689273">We believe that we must weigh the factor that you have just mentioned with the fact that Congress was told on repeated occasions that customers could go to Court in most instances by those very individuals who were going to be governed by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.039" offset="10749981">As a matter of fact, one of the representatives of the Petitioner made that very statement to Congress himself in testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.945" offset="10777671">It is... Therefore, the way that we believe that factor is relevant is that this Court has outlined a number of tools, accepted tools of statutory construction which must be looked at.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.405" offset="11871470">That is one factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.657" offset="11876486">I believe that because of the existence of that line of authority, because Congress was informed of it, we have to consider that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.145" offset="11902399">If that was not the case, then I think we would have to pass that, we would have to look at the other circumstances, for example, the way the reparations remedy itself works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.786" offset="11945031">Arbitration, which is one of the remedies provided, is only allowable for claims below $15,000, and must in any event be voluntary, certainly not the case if you have no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.343" offset="11991215">And the Currans have no alternative in this case, because while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act, including Section 4b, became effective on October 23rd, 1974, the reparations remedy did not become effective for three months later, in January of 1975, and claims under reparations could not be filed for one year thereafter, January, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.911" offset="12097482">So, while this type of a phase-in may certainly be explainable in terms of allowing the CFTC to adopt its regulations and prepare itself for its duties, it is completely, we believe, had Congress intended to make that an exclusive remedy, it would have logically made that available to everyone who might come before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.488" offset="12175744">At the same time, it strains credulity to believe that Congress intended to immunize conduct violative of Section 4b during that period prior to the time that reparations would take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.030" offset="12221929">This, we believe, is governed by the very standard tool of statutory construction that an unreasonable construction of a statute should yield to the reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.071" offset="12266128">So, unless this Court upholds the existence of a private right of action, the Currans will be without any remedy, and we believe that the duty which Congress imposed upon the Petitioner will become entirely precatory, certainly not a wise decision, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.365" offset="12335300">Now, consideration of the reparations procedure itself shows, even if it was available, shows that it would not be adequate because of the point made in response to Justice Stevens' question, that there is no review of a denial by the CFTC, and in fact in 1978 Congress analogized reparations as similar to the operation of a small claims court, certainly not the kind of description that would contemplate an exclusive remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.883" offset="12449403">Well, your point is basically that the CFTC and the federal courts simply are proceeding on two parallel, never meeting plains, because neither of them has to pay any attention to the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.084" offset="12550131">However, I would point out that with regard to securities legislation, while the SEC does not have a customer remedy procedure of this nature, there are various different courts interpreting the law, and certainly with regard to enforcement matters the SEC is interpreting the law as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.310" offset="12615124">That has not posed a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.811" offset="12621080">I don't believe it would pose a problem in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.065" offset="12650128">Indeed it has, and based certainly on some of the decisions, including those that were cited here, I believe, properly, but the fact of the matter is that Congress has in fact permitted the SEC to perform a certain function in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.325" offset="12711150">It has also permitted the courts to perform a certain function, and I believe that there has not been an inconsistency in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.648" offset="12736437">Finally, we would like to point out very briefly that the underlying purpose of the 1974 legislation, which was customer protection, would clearly be frustrated by denying the Currans the right to pursue their claims, but in addition to that there are other ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.659" offset="12816476">For example, the volume of cases with the Commission has become so great that the backlog there is now two to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.998" offset="12849808">This hardly comports with Congress's intent to make the reparations remedy an expeditious one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.587" offset="13612166">Let's assume you agree with the implication of my question that after Cort v. Ash and before the 1974 Act, it would be very difficult indeed to infer a cause of action under the 1936 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.041" offset="13730030">How do you justify putting the burden of proof on proponents of the view that there is no implied cause of action, understanding Cort to have said, in effect, that the lower courts that interpreted the 1936 Act as providing a cause of action were wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.241" offset="13830758">In other words, if they were wrong, and in effect you have conceded it would be a very close question, where does the burden lie here today?</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.280" offset="13870987">Well, I think it is difficult to say that those courts were necessarily wrong, because they are applying a different test, but as someone said in response to a question earlier, they might have gotten to the same place by a different test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.934" offset="14317576">Presumably, the Congress then thought that if it were appropriate to have an implied right of action under Section 4b, the courts would imply one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3604.405" offset="14555500">I think that as has been stated in either Sierra Club or Middlesex County by Justice Stevens, these were really analogous to the freewheeling days before Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.367" offset="14627284">These were the freewheeling days before Cort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.071" offset="14642122">It was well established in the 1890s and in 1936 when Congress enacted 4b that the courts were under a statutory tort theory going to go ahead and finish the job that presumably Congress could have done if it wanted to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3649.953" offset="14737625">One court could have come out against it and another court could have come out in favor, and both would have been right under your theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3660.226" offset="14778794">Well, I think that is probably accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.880" offset="14801364">I think depending on the circumstances of a particular case, although I have to say that this is a matter of legal history, to say how somebody would apply Rigsby.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.954" offset="14849638">I am really not an expert in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.805" offset="14857057">However, I think that there was a good deal of discretion left to the courts under Rigsby to determine whether the implication of a particular remedy, one among many, presumably, would be felicitous in terms of the administration of the statute and the goals that the statute was directed at furthering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.303" offset="14943052">This is a very different world that we are talking about in terms of what the law was when Congress enacted this section in 1936 and what the law is today, let alone what the law was in 1974 when Congress amended the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.457" offset="15075650">What I think should also be said about the cases that were decided on which we relied prior to 1974 is that not only were they unanimous, not only were they before Congress, Congress was clearly aware that this was what the state of the law was--</text>

            <text syncTime="3782.285" offset="15266971">Well, there is one Supreme Court case, the Deaktor case, in which the Court held that in the first instance a manipulation claim should be presented to the agency, and while the Court didn't squarely hold in that case, and we certainly concede that it didn't, that there was a private remedy under the manipulation section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.583" offset="15368221">Certainly the implication of the Court's decision that you go in the first instance to the agency or to the old commission certainly implies that in the second instance you can go to court, and indeed, the exchanges did not contest that in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.413" offset="15451500">They simply argued the case, and it was argued here as a prime jurisdiction question, which again shows how well settled in our view the law was at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.269" offset="15486922">And along that line, in fact, in 1974, when the exchanges, in an attempt to cut back on their liability, went to Congress and in effect conceded that as the law stood then they could be liable under the manipulation provisions, and that they needed relief, and Congress... there is no evidence that Congress gave them any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.257" offset="15618892">In years later, in testimony before the Commission, as we point out, the commodity professionals, the industry also treated this as a question that had been decided against them, both by the courts and by Congress in 1974 by testifying before the Commission that a private right of action was still available, and this was cramping their style, in effect, and it is only now, at this stage of the game, when this Court's decisions since Cannon have given the commodities industry a handle, a legal handle that they now say that there was never any cause of action.</text>

I was preparing a response to Justice Powell's question, not realizing that I wouldn't have an opportunity to answer it, and I would just say that if we did not believe that the legislative history and the historical context in which this issue arises led us to the view that Congress intended a private right of action to be sustained in 1974, we would not be here.</text>
