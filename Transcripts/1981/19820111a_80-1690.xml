            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136362">We'll hear arguments next in the American Medical Association against the Federal Trade Commission.</text>

            <label>Mr. Newton N. Minow</label>
            <text syncTime="81.785" offset="463415">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="84.504" offset="474282">This is a case where the FTC has been obsessed with the past, unconcerned with the present, and blind to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.228" offset="529244">This Court decided the important Goldfarb case in June of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.065" offset="556620">The American Medical Association immediately recognized the profound implications of Goldfarb for the medical profession and promptly undertook a major revision of its ethical standards and policies in light of Goldfarb.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.010" offset="616388">Without any investigation of any kind to learn the AMA's position, the FTC filed this complaint in the dark.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.716" offset="663200">We first heard of it when the FTC had a press conference in Washington and a reporter called the AMA's office in Chicago to inquire about the AMA's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.024" offset="708444">Once it had been filed, the FTC gave its attention only to the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.879" offset="739791">Five years later Judge Mansfield observed the Commission</text>
            <text syncTime="156.081" offset="760584">"was still pressing for its pound of flesh. "</text>
            <text syncTime="161.068" offset="780542">He said the FTC's action</text>
            <text syncTime="163.620" offset="790782">"has been unjustified, unnecessary, a waste of administrative and judicial resources, and in my view the FTC. "</text>
            <text syncTime="173.043" offset="828502">he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="173.626" offset="830801">"is engaged in the futile business of beating a dead horse. "</text>
            <text syncTime="177.530" offset="846475">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.313" offset="853580">How did such a thing happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="181.915" offset="863924">Ethical principles in the medical profession are nothing new.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.802" offset="887539">They go back thousands of years before the time of Hippocrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.556" offset="906556">In 1975 when this case began most states throughout the United States had laws that prohibited professional advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.245" offset="949293">In the light of Goldfarb, however, we recognized there was a need for change.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.863" offset="967787">So in the spring of 1976 the AMA published a new statement on advertising and solicitation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Newton N. Minow</label>
            <text syncTime="227.026" offset="1044378">--Were not exempt from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.609" offset="1050752">And we knew, I must say as well, we knew Bates was pending in the lower courts on its way up here, so we were aware of the change, the fundamental change that was evolving in the law with its relationship to professions and with its relationship to the First Amendment in advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.071" offset="1116581">We could see the winds of change were coming fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.689" offset="1131105">So what we stated in the spring of '76 was this: the public is entitled to know and the physician is entitled to advertise useful information provided... including information about fees... provided only that the information was not false or misleading or deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.834" offset="1211666">And we suggested and defined four practices that we believe have a significant capacity to mislead patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.940" offset="1248029">Now, that was 14 months before Bates was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.927" offset="1264016">Consumer groups, including the Ralph Nader organization, immediately congratulated the AMA as being the first profession to move with the evolving law.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.718" offset="1315216">We went to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.586" offset="1322635">We told the FTC what had happened, what we had already done about advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.805" offset="1339562">To no avail.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.674" offset="1346981">We told the FTC of our new positions on contract practice, practices to which the FTC has not objected to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.846" offset="1379686">We got nowhere with the staff so we filed a formal motion with the Commission and said to the Commission you ought to reconsider this in light of what we've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.452" offset="1418138">Besides, the Supreme Court is considering Bates.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.838" offset="1431618">It's on the docket of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.106" offset="1440708">Why don't you wait until the Supreme Court decides the law in Bates and then decide whether our current positions are appropriate to meet the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.509" offset="1470383">Denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.378" offset="1477802">June '77 this Court decided Bates.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.580" offset="1498595">The Court's opinion, written by Justice Blackmun, refers to the AMA's current standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.452" offset="1530151">The Court says professional societies should help to define the line between deceptive and nondeceptive practices... precisely what the AMA had done 14 months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.779" offset="1587412">And as the law further developed, values changed, the AMA continued to revise and to improve its guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.366" offset="1621789">You would think the FTC would have given us a medal.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.002" offset="1640284">Instead, we had a long, tedious trial concentrating on the events of the '20s, and the '30s, and the '40s, and the '50s, and the '60s and the early '70s, all pre-Goldfarb, in what Justice Jackson when he wrote the opinion in 1952 in Oregon State Medical Society called a great amount of archaeology.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.320" offset="1749580">After exhuming all this archaeology, the FTC introduced no evidence whatever on the competitive impact of the AMA's current policies on price, quality, availability of medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.114" offset="1820738">We called witnesses like the late Dr. Michael Halberstam, the late Dr. France Inglefinger, who was then the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine; and they told how the practices that we thought were misleading could horribly misguide and mislead patients, particularly the poor, the unsophisticated.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.778" offset="1903389">We showed through the tragic testimony of victims, particularly women who responded to ads about cosmetic surgery, who ended up being butchered on a filthy operating table and even to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.537" offset="1962426">The response of the FTC was rescind all your guidelines, get out of the business of trying to define the line between deceptive and nondeceptive practices, make no pronouncements whatever on advertising for two years, and then even after the two years don't do anything without our permission first.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.034" offset="2052496">We went to the FTC.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.736" offset="2059288">We said good lord, if Hippocrates were alive today, he'd need your permission before he could write the Hippocratic oath.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.470" offset="2170151">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="511.088" offset="2180705">Just at the break I was saying we then appealed to the full Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.123" offset="2200767">The Commission made no analysis of any kind about whether our current positions promoted or impeded competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.614" offset="2246742">They didn't even look at any anti-competitive consequence, pro-competitive consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.418" offset="2265969">Then in a curious opinion it said that it itself was not capable of writing new guidelines with respect to advertising; but then in a process which it called exegesis, it then proceeded to say that our guidelines were "troublesome", "worrisome", "overbroad".</text>
            <text syncTime="558.319" offset="2369622">We've got a strange opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.271" offset="2381430">It's not a case where the FTC is saying we have a better set of guidelines that we want you to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.508" offset="2406298">It's not a case where the FTC is saying why we think your guidelines are wrong or violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.329" offset="2433675">It's not a case where the FTC found that our current guidelines have any anti-competitive consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.648" offset="2462932">It is a case where the law, where social values were exploding and changing very quickly, where Goldfarb, Bates were creating a revolution in the thinking about the law and the professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.289" offset="2521446">Now, in the light of Bates why does the FTC press on?</text>
            <text syncTime="599.574" offset="2534612">Why are we still fighting?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="601.341" stopTime="607.227">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="601.341" offset="2541717">Well, did you press your W.T. Grant and Company argument before the FTC?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="newton_n_minow" startTime="607.227" stopTime="739.343">
            <label>Mr. Newton N. Minow</label>
            <text syncTime="607.227" offset="2565227">Very much, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.846" offset="2571706">We also did at the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.462" offset="2578184">We said there's no cognizable risk of any recurrence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.166" offset="2593022">All these practices have stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.350" offset="2601694">But the FTC said in the exercise of its discretion that our pre-Goldfarb orders, pre-Goldfarb orders violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, and therefore, in its discretion it would take the action that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.360" offset="2661776">Now, I think there is an important question of jurisdiction involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.828" offset="2683614">Perhaps that's why the FTC presses on.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.216" offset="2697198">I think the FTC is stretching to establish a precedent that it has jurisdiction under the Federal Trade Commission Act over not-for-profit professional associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.106" offset="2744741">Unlike the Sherman Act, unlike the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act does not apply to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.010" offset="2776401">The Clayton Act, passed at the same Congress as the Federal Trade Commission Act, applies to all associations, all persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.116" offset="2812764">But when it got to writing the Federal Trade Commission Act, Congress very carefully limited the language of the FTC's jurisdiction to an association</text>
            <text syncTime="680.774" offset="2859366">"organized to carry on business for its own profit or the profit of its members. "</text>
            <text syncTime="688.279" offset="2889459">Unlike the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act is not a carefully studied attempt to bring everyone within its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.302" offset="2929479">Now, the three not-for-profit institutions, professional associations that are here simply are not organized to carry on business for their own profit or for that of their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.145" offset="2988933">It is undisputed, undisputed in the record, even taking the FTC's witness, that the bulk, the principal part of each association's resources are devoted to furthering not economic interests, not profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.738" offset="3051314">It is equally undisputed that when the Federal Trade Commission Act was passed in 1914 that learned professions were not regarded as business.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.988" offset="3172313">The bulk of its activity involves accreditation of medical schools, scientific work, research, validating drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.994" offset="3204287">The Chief Justice is familiar with its work involving prisons and health in prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.613" offset="3222782">It's involved fundamentally in work involving advancing health is the bulk of its activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.016" offset="3248382">Now, we don't suggest that the medical profession is outside the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.503" offset="3278370">We don't suggest that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.955" offset="3288088">We understand that the Justice Department can invoke the Sherman Act against professionals in the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.017" offset="3360395">But the FTC, we contend, with its tunnel vision is not so equipped to make those judgments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="1719.376" offset="7013776">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.578" offset="7026628">In this case the Federal Trade Commission, acting under Section 5 of the FTC Act, found a continuing nationwide private agreement in restraint of trade among AMA and its affiliates and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.908" offset="7115967">This agreement was effectuated by certain ethical restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.896" offset="7139895">The restraints on which the Commission focused were in effect at the time the Commission filed its complaint in December 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.953" offset="7180124">They almost totally banned advertising by physicians, and they protected traditional fee-for-service practice from competition by alternative contract arrangements of physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.129" offset="7236862">So we dealt with advertising and what is usually denominated by the American Medical Association as contract practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.652" offset="7274896">Now, the Commission entered a cease and desist order designed to eliminate the conspiracy, which was nationwide, and its effects throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.341" offset="7309691">The order was intended to leave physicians free to choose whether and how and with whom they will make contractual arrangements for their services and whether and how they will compete through nondeceptive advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.232" offset="7365280">It was intended to open the previously blocked flow of information needed by consumers seeking access to the market for medical services, for I emphasize to Your Honors that there is a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.592" offset="7418674">Now, the Commission also found that because advertising in the medical context involves public interest considerations sharply different from those applicable in the ordinary commercial context that the American Medical Association and similar organizations may and should continue through ethical standards to police false or deceptive or oppressive advertising by physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.809" offset="7523582">The issues that my brother has discussed with you are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.611" offset="7542703">First, does the Commission have jurisdiction over AMA under Section 4 of the FTC Act; that is, is the American Medical Association a corporation within the meaning of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.604" offset="7598710">And should the Commission have terminated the case after AMA began to make changes subsequent to the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.280" offset="7653462">Now, the only matters before the Commission when that occurred are AMA's statements in April 1976 dealing with advertising, and its March 1977 revision of its opinions and reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.021" offset="7708424">I think that I should touch a bit on the chronology because I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.694" offset="7739040">The April 1976 statement was not an abstract new piece of writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.335" offset="7789613">The AMA was very careful in drafting that statement to assert that it was reaffirming its prior position on advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.443" offset="8166089">For example, in the very statements which AMA says today represented a change, it was also saying that local societies could have restrictions that exceed anything that AMA had in its current principles of ethics with respect to advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.045" offset="8720512">And then there would be a slight shift because they would allow obviously some of the simplest forms of advertising... a card, a sign, an official directory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.519" offset="8766383">So that the Commission's finding on this matter is that the AMA's abandonment was highly ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.523" offset="8794386">In fact, how ambiguous can best be seen, I think, by looking at something that AMA has brought to the Court's attention, although it's extra-record, in January of 1980 they finally abolished the ban on solicitation entirely from their principles of ethics, July of 1980, and in January of 1981 they issued a complete new edition of the opinions and reports which very clearly seems to be an effort to come into conformity with the law by providing that doctors can advertise as long as it's not misleading, or false, or deceptive, or oppressive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.656" offset="9938968">Now, there's much debate about what the Commission did or said with respect to AMA's changes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.630" offset="9978778">What the Commission did was to examine the changes very closely under the standards mentioned by Justice Rehnquist, the W.T. Grant standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.736" offset="10023291">In fact, AMA's argued before this Court and before the Commission that we couldn't even do that, that we had to judge their liability on their post-complaint changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.127" offset="10060803">I know of no case that says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.027" offset="10068431">The Oregon Medical Society, which my brother invokes, doesn't support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.197" offset="10085149">The Commission examined the conduct alleged in the complaint, found a violation, and looked to see the relationship between that conduct and the post-complaint changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.137" offset="10128826">What it was concerned with was three questions, once it had found this nationwide conspiracy which the evidence showed had gone on with the continued enforcement of the old standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.259" offset="10165397">It looked first to see whether the post-complaint changes by AMA would dissipate the effects o the conspiracy, because that, after all, is the first concern of any remedy in a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.067" offset="10212626">The second question was whether the post-complaint changes reflected a clear and unambiguous abandonment of the conspiracy, not only by AMA but by the other members, because the conspiracy was between AMA and its federated affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.326" offset="10273649">And finally, the Commission had to consider whether there was a cognizable danger of recurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.694" offset="10295069">This kind of analysis is essentially what I think is implied in two categories of cases: first, the line of cases reflected, for example, in FTC against Colgate concerning the Commission's remedial responsibilities and discretion; and secondly, the line of cases reflected in W.T. Grant and cases in that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.358" offset="10385766">The issues thus never went to AMA's post-complaint... I mean the issue about AMA's post-complaint changes didn't go to its liability; they went rather to the appropriateness under the public interest of a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.419" offset="10453998">Now, the Commission examined at length that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.621" offset="10470821">It found that AMA's changes simply did not meet these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.108" offset="10504780">The record, I think, can be examined.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.611" offset="12206710">The findings of the Commission were that the bulk of AMA's members are engaged in the profit-motivated private practice of medicine, in the traditional practice of medicine, fee-for-service medicine.</text>
