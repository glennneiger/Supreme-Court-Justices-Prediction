            <text syncTime="11.106" offset="180530">Mr. Stewart, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="197144">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the validity of state citizenship requirements for certain specified classes of public employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.150" offset="244687">It is an appeal from a decision of a three judge federal court holding that it was unconstitutional for California to require its probation officers to be citizens, and that further, California's statutory scheme which required peace officers in several enumerated categories to be citizens was unconstitutionally overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.695" offset="322845">The plaintiffs in this case were all applicants for only one peace officer position, that of deputy probation officer with the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.932" offset="351789">This is the second appeal in the case, the Court having granted the appeal and remanded it back to the three judge court for reconsideration in light of its recently published decision in Foley versus Connelie.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.406" offset="397660">The second time around, the District Court again by a two to one vote held that it was unconstitutional to require citizenship of deputy probation officers, and that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.897" offset="447606">California's statutory scheme sets forth many enumerated and specific categories of peace officers, and also sets forth the qualification for peace officers, one of which is citizenship of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.640" offset="502672">The California statutory scheme also considers and imposes certain training requirements on the enumerated categories of peace officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.894" offset="531616">This case calls once again on this Court to consider as it did in Foley and Ambach whether certain occupations, public occupations, in this case probation officers, are of such a nature that they can be constitutionally limited to citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.553" offset="590235">The second issue, of course, is whether or not the California statutory scheme was unconstitutionally overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.826" offset="619387">We believe that the three judge federal court seriously erred when it concluded that the probation officer's position was not of a nature that citizenship could legitimately be required.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.032" offset="664213">Mr. Stewart, when you say that the scheme was considered overbroad, I take it you are referring to the Court's language in Sugarman against Dougall that a narrowly tailored scheme would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.109" offset="720533">Do you think that has to do with statutory draftsmanship as to what positions are included and what are not?</text>

            <text syncTime="160.417" offset="777689">I think that the Sugarman language should be limited to the context of that particular case in the sense that in Sugarman the New York statute struck down encompassed all classes of civil service servants in New York without distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.278" offset="841219">Well, didn't the Court's language, our Court, our language focus on the fact that it included garbage collectors?</text>

            <text syncTime="183.865" offset="871521">It was overbroad because it included all categories of civil servants, from garbage collectors to clerk typists to perhaps police officers and the like.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="210.715" offset="978937">The California legislature in 1980 took another look at the statute, and there were several categories that were eliminated, of which one category was cemetery sextons, custodial officers, and there were several other categories, but the difference between the California statute and that of New York is that they specifically for one thing, it deals with one generic class, that is, a peace officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.763" offset="1059080">They all possess certain peace officer characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.898" offset="1071619">Secondly, each of the specific peace officer categories is specifically delineated in separate subsections of the code, so we have one section dealing in our case with probation officer, another dealing with sheriffs and police officers, another one dealing with highway patrol and various other categories.</text>
