            <text syncTime="77.914" offset="389043">Mr. Clarke, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="82.619" offset="407851">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.210" offset="426241">About 18 months ago, Congress enacted the Rock Island Transition and Employee Assistance Act and as it considered to be an integral part of that Act, it added what it -- what it considered to be essential to rails -- continuation of rail service in the Midwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.242" offset="498339">It added an alternative employee protective program that it -- that it said should be made available immediately to the employees of the Rock Island who were displaced as a result of the demise of that carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.762" offset="556435">That program was enjoined approximately nine days, ten days after it was enacted, signed into law by President Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.818" offset="592693">Congress readdressed the situation during the summer of 1980 and in the Staggers Rail Act enacted an amendment to the Rock Island Act which was passed and signed into law on October 14th, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.685" offset="648177">On October 16th, an order dated October 15th but actually entered on the 16th, the Court again enjoined, the District Court again enjoined the Act because it said the Staggers Rail Act was really only a cosmetic change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.385" offset="706901">It didn't change the substance of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.679" offset="720066">At that point presumably Railroad Labor Executives' Association, the appellant in these -- in these consolidated cases, had earlier taken an appeal to this Court from the June 9th injunctive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.094" offset="773774">That appeal is 80-415.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.341" offset="786731">Once the Court entered the injunctive order on October 16th, RLEA took an appeal to the Seventh Circuit because in amending the Staggers Act, Congress had also amended where the appeal should go.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.887" offset="836990">So we went to the Seventh Circuit and the Seventh Circuit was required by the Staggers Rail Act amendments to decide the case en banc within 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.784" offset="876487">It did, but unfortunately, it split three-three and on -- on December 16th, it entered an order affirming the District Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.469" offset="911283">The next appeal was then taken by RLEA to this Court and on April 27th this Court accepted or noted probable jurisdiction in the second appeal 1239 case and deferred probable jurisdiction in the -- or deferred consideration of probable jurisdiction in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.893" offset="980977">At the outset, I would like to clear up one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.297" offset="998636">RLEA submits that the first case, 80-415, the appeal was properly filed and timely filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.194" offset="1030192">However, the Staggers Rail Act amendments mooted that case because the Act, the injunctive order which is preventing the implement -- implementation of the Rock Island Act Employee Protection is actually the October injunction and not the June injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.761" offset="1100409">The June injunction is now moot and we submit probable jurisdiction should be noted in the case vacated in grounds of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.174" offset="1138130">Going to the questions that are before this Court, the first thing that the Court, we submit, has to address is the question raised in the noting of probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.999" offset="1193405">That is, basically, what issues are before the Court at this time?</text>
            <text syncTime="283.231" offset="1210332">We would submit that when we filed our brief the only issue that was really before this Court was the question of whether or not the Staggers Rail Act amendments and the Rock Island Act had granted the estate a remedy or means to obtain compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.338" offset="1282744">If compensation was available, there cannot be, we submit, an unconstitutional taking of property because the whole substance of the -- or it can be called the Just Compensation Clause or the Taking Clause or the Fifth Amendment is the adequate provision of compensation.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="319.835" offset="1356723">Mr. Clarke, do you think that Congress Acting under its commerce power can impair the obligation of contracts which the -- a State is specifically prohibited from doing by the -- by the Constitution?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_ob_clarke_jr" startTime="343.044" stopTime="441.093">
            <label>Mr. John O'B. Clarke, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="343.044" offset="1449614">No, Your Honor, we do not believe that Congress has that power under the Commerce Clause to impair the obligation of contracts, but the problem in this case is, first of all, is that issue really before this Court that's basically in the taking issue, and the second point is, are the obligations of contract being impaired?</text>
            <text syncTime="360.104" offset="1517846">And that gets into the question of whether there was a pre-existing obligation on the part of the estate which we submit there was and I will get into that in a second or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.111" offset="1553895">The trustee creditors and the trustee below and the court below, the District Court, found that the Rock Island Act affected an unconstitutional taking of property because the Court indicated that it came as a startling concept to him, to the Court, that Congress could impose an obligation upon the estate and take $75 million to be paid to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.850" offset="1660788">As he went on to say, “Congress does not have the power to take private property for public use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="404.831" offset="1696732">We submit that that is looking at the wrong part of the Just Compensation or Taking Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.655" offset="1720034">What has to be looked at, as this Court indicated before, is at the time of the taking, was there an adequate provision made for compensation?</text>
            <text syncTime="420.863" offset="1760889">If there was in fact an adequate provision, even though the money is not paid upfront, then there cannot be an unconstitutional taking because the vindicated -- the gravamen of an unconstitutional taking is an uncompensated taking and this Court has indicated in the Rail Act cases and going back to the Cherokee case, the Kansas City -- the Kansas Southern --</text>

            <text syncTime="458.016" offset="1909474">We have a problem with the -- the appellees, the Rock Island appellees, in the -- in the position that Congress exceeded the scope of its authority under the Commerce Clause by enacting a private benefit for employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.778" offset="3144543">But if Congress states in the preamble of its Act that it's exercising its powers under the Commerce Clause to enact legislation which it believes has a public purpose and that the Act it is doing is simply compromising an obligation that already existed, and this is why we submit the taking issue when it finally does come up is not really (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="822.226" offset="3366270">That's the ultimate part of the taking issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.830" offset="3372749">One aspect of the taking issue here would be the question of whether or not the Act that Congress did was for public or private benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.349" offset="3402842">Now, one thing that has been sort of not highlighted in this case is the actual factual situation which leads to the conclusion that this was in fact an act of Congress under its Commerce Clause for a public benefit, a very strong public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.516" offset="3475462">When the Rock Island Act was being considered by Congress, it started back in February and March of 1980 before the abandonment order was even authorized to be sought for, that didn't occur until April 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.244" offset="3534394">And when Congress was considering what to do with the demise of the Rock Island and the directed service which was to end on May 31st, at that point, there was no more authority in the ICC to authorize any continued operation over that line and the line would completely cease and all service will end at that point, so Congress had to address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.378" offset="3622897">And in addressing that issue, Congress realized as this Court has indicated from back in the 1930s, the interest of employees was an extremely important element in the perpetuation of that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.730" offset="3676292">And in order to afford that -- that employee protection, if you want to call it, that arrangements to help the people who are being affected and to preserve the public interest, Congress had to look at the interest of employees, as this Court has again intended as part of the national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.067" offset="3745673">And in doing that Congress worked and as the legislative history indicates, Congress worked along with Labor and representatives of rail management.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.844" offset="3780781">And the arrangement that came out of that combination of the parties was a combination of the Miami courts for the March 4 hiring agreement and this particular piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.379" offset="3826966">The basic logic that the Court found in this legislation only comes because he is disregarding the March 4 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.525" offset="3855492">The March 4 agreement is an integral part of the Rock Island legislation and between the two, they provide a form of protection for employees who have spent their time in operating this railroad who would then be available for continued rail operations over that line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.845" offset="4984817">Unfortunately, the Seventh Circuit has taken a different position but the important thing on this is the ICC up until 1976 always considered itself to have the discretion to impose this level or this type of protection in an entire line of abandonment case, that in 1979 when Congress -- 1976, we submit, Congress took that discretion away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.618" offset="5083874">In 1979, it transferred the remaining discretion and the power of the ICC had to authorize abandonments over to the reorganization court and the legislative history in the Rock Island Act prior to the whole confirmation of the abandonment coming up in the reorganization court indicates that Congress believed that the '79 Act and the '76 Act, based on the '76 Act, had required that level of protection in this case.Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1288.566" offset="5231622">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the federal appellees appeared here today in the support of RLEA's appeal from the October order from the Seventh Circuit's affirmance of the District Court's October order holding an Act of Congress -- enjoining an Act of Congress on grounds of its unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.980" offset="5309363">We regard the earlier cases moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.038" offset="5321588">The federal appellees submit that the amended Rock Island Act does not, as the District Court concluded, affect an unconstitutional taking of private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.339" offset="5354711">We make two basic arguments on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.939" offset="5365160">First, we submit that the Act does not take property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and second, if contrary to our submission, the Court were to find that it did affect the taking of property, we submit that a reasonable, proper and adequate provision for compensation has been made in the -- in the Tucker Act and therefore for two reasons, it was improper for the District Court to enter this injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.801" offset="5460559">Either there was an adequate remedy at law or there was no violation to remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.501" offset="5483443">I'm going to address the taking question first, a question that we do urge the Court to decide in this case and to understand what -- why we are trying to say that this Act is not a taking, you have to step back for a moment and consider the crisis that Congress was responding to when it was considering and when it enacted the Rock Island Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.247" offset="5570378">And you have to consider also the legal and historical context with respect to employee protection against which Congress was also -- to -- to which Congress was also responding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.757" offset="5612383">The Rock Island Act did not, as the private appellees occasional suggest, leap unannounced out of Congress' brow three days before the District Court authorized the abandonment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.756" offset="5664419">In September of 1979, the Rock Island Act totally ceased operations overall of its lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.304" offset="5690646">It was a critical importance to the Middle West particularly to the shipment of -- of farm products out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.119" offset="5713843">In the months thereafter, this transportation system was held together just essentially by direct service orders given by the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.652" offset="5744040">Congress was justifiably concerned with the effect of the liquidation of so large a railroad not only on the Middle West but on transportation services generally on its -- its ripple effect with respect to other lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.578" offset="5795763">And the Rock Island Act which was the congressional response to this, the Senate report on this issued in March of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.108" offset="5825856">This Act called for the implement -- among other things for the implementation of a plan either negotiated by the parties or devised by the ICC for providing limited compensation for those employees who were displaced as a result of the Rock Island's termination of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.775" offset="5888550">It further provided the cost of plan would be charge to administrative expenses of the estate, that the benefits could be paid through federally guaranteed loans and that there would be a top, a maximum of $75 million, it could not exceed that amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.267" offset="6382473">What was on the books then affecting this railroad was the Milwaukee Act -- Section 17(a) of the Milwaukee Act which said, “Certificates of abandonment shall include conditions providing fair and equitable arrangements for the employees shall include.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.537" offset="6443599">It was absolute language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.248" offset="6450391">Now, it's true that there had been interpretations of that language as giving discretion to the reorganization court similar to what the ICC had considered that it had under the 4-R Act, discretion not to impose employee protection arrangements in some cases of whole line abandonments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.089" offset="6521758">But just as the ICC had always thought they had the discretion to create exceptions to their general rule that they wouldn't a -- apply these conditions and whole line abandonments, that discretion remained here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.628" offset="6571913">There was a very real possibility while Congress was devising this operation -- this legislation that this estate could have had imposed on it what are called the New York Dock conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.361" offset="9902838">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the principal issue presented in this appeal is whether by special legislation Congress can impose upon a bankrupt railroad already in liquidation a new obligation solely for the benefit of its former employees who are no longer going to be working in the railroad industry, an obligation that will displace the interest of the creditors and the shareholders of that railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.369" offset="10010881">This proceeding depends under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act and this Act has two purposes - first, the pubic interest and the continued rail service, and secondly and an equally important purpose, the conservation of the estate in the interest of the creditors and the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.909" offset="10085069">Now, with the outset of these proceedings, so when they were filed in March 17, 1975, Judge McGarr ordered the trustee to continue operations of the Rock Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.165" offset="10130104">And at that time he had to make a -- a determination that the railroad was reorganizable and that the security of the creditors would not be impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.123" offset="10173885">And I would submit to the Court that if Judge McGarr had thought at that time that there was a possibility of labor protection being imposed in the amounts that the RLEA and the Government contend was possible, he never would have permitted reorganization to go on at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.299" offset="10238564">He would have stopped it right then and there because the thought of imposing six years of wages, giving that to employees in the event of liquidation would mean that there would be no way that -- that the security of the creditors could be protected if reorganization proceedings would be ongoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.711" offset="10304288">And I submit that that would be true in almost every railroad reorganization proceeding, that the proceeding would have to stop right there if the liability of that magnitude could be imposed upon the estate of a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.995" offset="10357369">Now, in pursuit of these public interest objectives of Section 77 however, the reorganization court permitted the -- the ongoing rail operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.006" offset="10397389">And for five years, the trustee of the Rock Island paid out $1 billion in wages and benefits to the Rock Island employees while the estate eroded in an amount in excess of $210 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.946" offset="10461232">And in answer to Justice Marshall's question about the continuation of the railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and the railroad retirement fund, I should point out that during this time of reorganization, the Rock Island trustee contributed over $14 million to the railroad unemployment insurance fund and in excess of a $100 million to the railroad retirement fund just as the Rock Island had done in years prior to reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.478" offset="10563318">Of course, we have no question about the propriety of those contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.603" offset="10587769">As the reorganization entered its fifth year, three key events occurred and they had been alluded to thus far in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.542" offset="10615563">The first occurred in the summer of 1979 when the employees of the Rock Island struck the Rock Island and as a result, it ceased rail operations and on September 26, 1979, the Interstate Commerce Commission declared the Rock Island trustee cashless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.848" offset="10684840">And from that point forward the trustee himself was not able to conduct any rail operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.777" offset="10708559">The second key event was on January 25, 1980 when the reorganization court found that there no longer was any possibility of a successful reorganization of the Rock Island and he ordered the trustee to commence liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.137" offset="10765924">And really, from that point forward the Rock Island's fate was sealed.From that point forward it was clear that the Rock Island was withdrawing from the public interest service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.711" offset="10808243">Then on June 2 of 1980, the reorganization court formally confirmed the total abandonment of all of its lines and at that time, declined to condition abandonment on the payment of any form of the so-called traditional labor protection, and that order was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.687" offset="10892148">It was just on the eve of that particular order that Congress enacted and President Carter signed into law the Rock Island Transition and Employee Assistance Act which its new labor protection obligation of $75 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.709" offset="10948259">And that Act in essence would -- would impose a payment of 80% of a former employee's salary for up to three years or a lump sum payment of each -- to each employee of $25,000 depending upon seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.648" offset="11011998">The Congress stated the purpose of that Act to be a public purpose, to continue rail service in the midwest, but as Judge McGarr found, there was no connection between the payment of a lump sum severance pay to a former employee who is no longer going to continue in any rail service, there was no connection between that and ongoing rail operations in the midwest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.091" offset="11397774">The railroad was ongoing, it was obtaining net income that was generated by the savings that were affected by the consolidation of rail service and in that case, “Those savings,” the Court said, “could be forced to be apportioned between the employees who were displaced.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.663" offset="13460089">This morning, I alluded to the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals finding that there was no labor protection in the Rock Island abandonment situation and I would like to explain the reasoning that the Seventh Circuit provided and the reasoning that we have stated in our brief which was filed before the Seventh Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.701" offset="13540233">Labor protection arose originally in connection with mergers and consolidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.029" offset="13565519">And the theory behind labor protection was that to the extent that a merger or consolidation resulted in a savings for a particular ongoing railroad and jobs were lost in the process, those savings ought to be shared with the employees who -- who lost their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.112" offset="13653813">Subsequently, Congress provided that labor protection should also be accorded in an abandonment situation and in doing so, Congress cross-referenced the statute on Abandonment with the statute on -- on Consolidations and Mergers and said that the labor protection that would be imposed in an abandonment situation would be the same as that imposed in a merger and consolidation situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.779" offset="13756527">This involved the payment of the so-called New York Dock conditions which were applied in a partial abandonment situation, the six years of labor protection, 80% of an employee's wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.571" offset="13803652">The ICC developed a consistent practice of exempting or declining to impose any labor protection in a total abandonment situation and when Congress re-codified the Interstate Commerce Act, it indicated in the legislative history of the adoption of that statute that no change in the law developed by the ICC respecting total abandonments was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.524" offset="13903544">And that same point was made when Congress transferred authority over abandonments in bankruptcy situations from the ICC to the reorganization court and I should note this on the side that in the Rock Island case, it is the reorganization court under Section 17 of the Milwaukee Road Restructuring Act that has authority and discretion as to whether to impose labor protection in an abandonment situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.367" offset="14010855">But all the time that Congress was re-codifying these languages and amending and then transferring it, it always referred back to the language that had -- to the to the language of the statute that had been interpreted by the ICC as not requiring labor protection in a total abandonment situation and that is what the --</text>

            <text syncTime="4890.276" offset="19638466">Yes, Your Honor, I would have a concern about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.006" offset="19649438">But there is also the point that there is irreparable harm to the Rock Island in that an estate which has been -- which has already been existent in reorganization for five years with immense losses and all of these costs of administration claims that that is going to be prolonged for another several years while the Tucker Act claim is being prosecuted and there is no reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.858" offset="19740866">There might have been a reason for that on the 3R Act Cases where the Government had to cease specific property to maintain rail service in the Northeast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.105" offset="19773781">Here, we are talking about fungible money that could just as well come from the Government if, in fact, any public purpose is being serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.733" offset="19796350">We do not think there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.199" offset="19802202">It could just as well come from the Government as it could come from a bankrupt estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.275" offset="19818502">If this -- if this operates as a taking, what the Rock Island is doing in essence is advancing money for the Federal Government and that we submit that just doesn't make any sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="4958.456" offset="19911185">The one point that has been -- seems to be focused on and becomes almost like the central point is whether or not this Act, the 106 and 110 of the Act create a private benefit rather than serves a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.232" offset="19974296">Now, we submit that the rationale given by the creditors for what is the purpose -- the whole purpose behind labor protection misses the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.091" offset="20017764">This Court in the Louden case and then in the ICC versus the Railway Labor Executives' Association case stressed that the only justification for imposing employee protection is part of the Public National Transportation system is to increase this ability of the labor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.152" offset="20094042">I just like to read one short paragraph or part of a paragraph from the Railway Labor Executives' Association case 315 U.S.373.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.374" offset="20134897">This is the abandonment case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5036.993" offset="20225385">Your Honor, Brooks-Scanlon has been interpreted by this Court to allow a railroad to eventually withdraw itself from rail service but until the public interest and continued rail services are satisfied, the public interest factor remains a viable consideration and the railroad can be required to continue on even if there is an erosion of the interest of secured creditors and that's in the --</text>

            <text syncTime="5067.098" offset="20345758">Brooks-Scanlon doesn't, Your Honor, but the New Haven case, I believe the Penn-Central merger and the Denver and Rio Grande case which is cited in our brief, indicate that the Brooks-Scanlon doctrine is qualified by the fact that all our railroad cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely at a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.443" offset="20415139">There can be a reasonable period of time while a public solution, public interest solution is found and we submit the difference that we have with the creditors and the trustee on this is that part of the public interest solution that has to be found here is how do you provide for a stabilized labor force?</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.204" offset="20486192">Now, the ICC case goes on to indicate that the Louden case specifically recognized that the imposition of conditions similar to those sought here might strengthen the national system through their effect on the morale and stability of railway workers generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.125" offset="20545856">Exactly the same considerations of national importance are applicable and operative here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.974" offset="20565291">And we submit they're applicable and operative here as well because the entire purpose of labor protection is not just for Rock Island people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.233" offset="20598310">It is for all railroad employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.528" offset="20607505">Mr. Murray has indicated that the railway system is a national community type of establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.953" offset="20633209">What happens to me -- what happens to one railroad here affects another railroad either through direct intercourse of commerce or through the passing of the word of mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.951" offset="20673229">If employees know that if the railroad goes bankrupt and they are going to be cut out in the cold unless they are lucky enough to get a job with somebody else, why should a railroad employee stay with any other carrier today that's in financial problems?</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.167" offset="20738117">It's because of that consideration and the need to continue railroad workers on their jobs and how that's quite available to discontinue.</text>
