            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="66.875" offset="399603">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the international obligations of the United States under the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation with Japan and similar treaties with many other countries, an obligation to permit a foreign investor to manage and control its investment in this country by engaging executives and other specialists of its choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.632" offset="538574">Sumitomo Shoji America is a company organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.054" offset="572325">It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Japan, a general trading company or Sogo Shoji, with more than 100 offices around the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.912" offset="627704">Plaintiffs below are women who are or were employed as secretaries by Sumitomo.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.068" offset="660305">They brought suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, alleging two principal causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.241" offset="689040">First, in Paragraph 12 of the complaint, they allege that Sumitomo discriminated against them by restricting them to clerical positions on the ground that they were women, and second, in Paragraph 13, that Sumitomo had discriminated against them by restricting them to clerical positions on the ground of their nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.687" offset="778796">Sumitomo answered denying the claims of discrimination and asserting that its employment practices challenged in the complaint were authorized by the Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty, and on this basis Sumitomo moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.769" offset="867090">The district court denied this motion, holding that Sumitomo as a New York company was not entitled to the benefit of the Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.891" offset="907632">That question was certified for interlocutory appeal under Section 1292(b) of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.866" offset="947547">On the issue certified, the Second Circuit reversed the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.437" offset="973774">It held, as did the Fifth Circuit in a substantially identical case, Spiess versus C. Itoh, Incorporated, that a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese investor could indeed invoke the protection of the Treaty, but contrary to the Fifth Circuit, the Second Circuit went on to hold that on the merits the Treaty did not preclude examination under Title VII of Sumitomo's employment practices with respect to senior personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.914" offset="1135733">On this ground, it affirmed the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss, and we took our petition for certiorari from that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.270" offset="1173141">Now, I want to go directly to the Treaty issues that I think are at the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.039" offset="1204174">Indeed in my view, the deeper question of this case is whether the United States will faithfully carry out Treaty obligations undertaken with two dozen foreign countries, obligations that it placed in the Treaty and placed in the Treaty for its own purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.472" offset="1293931">There are two issues under the Treaty, two components to the Treaty question.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.626" offset="1318591">The first is who may invoke the employment right under the Treaty, and the second is what is the scope of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.915" offset="1359760">As to the first, who may invoke the right, I think that need not detain us long.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.670" offset="1390689">Both courts of appeals decided that a wholly owned subsidiary of a foreign investor was entitled to the benefit of the employment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.712" offset="1434888">And why?</text>
            <text syncTime="326.228" offset="1436978">Because neither court of appeals could perceive any sound reason or basis in policy for distinguishing in terms of the employment right between foreign investment carried out through a branch and foreign investment carried out through a locally organized subsidiary.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="349.510" offset="1530078">I suppose, Professor Chayes, you would carry that down to a subsidiary of a subsidiary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="355.164" offset="1552752">Well, I think that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.949" offset="1567903">That is our... our position is that the foreign investor has a right to manage and control his investment in the United States by engaging executive personnel of his choice, and if his investment is... takes the form of a subsidiary of a subsidiary, the answer is the same.</text>

            <label>Mr. Abram Chayes</label>
            <text syncTime="399.776" offset="1731116">--Well, the regulations under the Immigration and Naturalization Act provide and have provided always that a 51-percent controlled subsidiary has the nationality of the state of its owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.470" offset="1793915">If you go below that, below 51 percent, then you are not talking about a controlled subsidiary, and it is the right to control and manage the investment that is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.195" offset="1844801">If you look at Article VII of the Treaty, Article VII says that the foreign investor has the right to invest in this country in any lawful juridical form.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.715" offset="1970920">It seems to be that the brief discloses a compromise between various points of view in the government, and that is what I would like to say on this branch of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.956" offset="2015851">The essential point is, there should not be distinction as between branch investment and subsidiary investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.645" offset="2050646">Nobody has been able to adduce a reason why one should distinguish between investment carried out through branches or investment carried out through subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.101" offset="2088471">On the contrary, the major objective of these treaties, post-World War Two treaties, was to accommodate investment through locally incorporated subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.576" offset="2138313">That was a new element in 1952, although already quite popular.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.630" offset="2158584">By now, it is the predominant form of overseas investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.099" offset="2176452">In the United States, 85 percent of our direct investment abroad takes the form of locally incorporated subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.870" offset="2207485">That is why the State Department said, the same State Department, Justice White--</text>

            <text syncTime="530.145" offset="2252625">--but I want to say that as late as July, 1979, the State Department said that an interpretation of the Treaty that would exclude locally incorporated subsidiaries would gut the Treaty of much of its value for the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.763" offset="3315077">I think that it performs a function that has not been very fully called to our attention, and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.619" offset="3354574">think Article XXII was really designed to say what companies of... what kinds of enterprises or entities in the foreign country did we have to recognize, and conversely, what kinds of entities in our country did the Japanese have to recognize, and all this talk about a single simple case is not a test about the nationality of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.670" offset="3454780">It is really a test about what kind of entity in the foreign milieu we have to recognize as a company, and the reason why this article was drafted in these terms was that previously, previously in the U.S. Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with Germany, for example, or with Japan, the Treaties in the 19 teens and the twenties, a whole series of requirements were established before a company could claim recognition by the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.897" offset="3619665">It had not be not only organized within the territory of one party, but have its seat there, and so on, if you look at the German Treaty or the Japanese Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.038" offset="3664178">And so they said, now let's sweep all that aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.740" offset="3675045">Let's have a simple test that tells me when I have to recognize a Japanese enterprise, and tells the Japanese when they have to recognize my enterprise, and that is when it is incorporated in the other party's... it is organized under the other party's laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.100" offset="3740455">It has little or nothing to do, I think, Mr. Justice Stevens, with what we have to do about companies organized under our own laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.324" offset="3785386">But even if you take that view, then it seems to me, as I said before, it may be that the State Department has some concerns about calling a company organized under the United States, a VIII, because that may have a carry-over, a carry-over effect in other parts of the Treaty, but in fact, the State Department says, you can get there by a different route.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.927" offset="4319747">And in talking about the scope of the Treaty right, I want to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.465" offset="4337928">First, Sumitomo is not claiming a general immunity from Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.485" offset="4370006">We are speaking only of a narrow group of top executives and specialists necessary to manage and control the investment, and second, I think it is essential to keep in mind that these employment rights were put in the Treaty not by the Japanese, not by the Germans, not by the Danish, not by the Israelis, but by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.786" offset="4475227">We were the draftsmen of this Treaty, and what we wanted out of Article VIII of this Treaty is also stated in the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.244" offset="4513053">It appears in Footnote 14 at Page 24-25, and what we wanted was, it says, the purpose of Article VIII was to override these restrictions, host country restrictions on employment of aliens, and I am quoting now,</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.519" offset="4578150">"so that American businessmen operating abroad would be able to select U.S. nationals for essential positions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.559" offset="4614303">and that is the right that Sumitomo is seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.911" offset="4627678">Now, to define the scope of that right, as I say, I think the government in sort of general terms accepts that statement of what the right is, but then they say, oh, well, on this record we can't say that all these people that occupy challenged positions are really executive personnel, are really specialists of the kind mentioned in the treaty, so we have got to send the whole thing back for a case by case examination of what these executive positions amount to and what these specialist positions amount to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.202" offset="4776889">Your Honors, we believe that that question can be settled as a matter of law on this record by this Court, and it can be settled if we expand our horizon a little bit and take into account additional legal materials that are not referred to by the government, and essentially the legal materials involved are the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 and the regulations thereunder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2012.189" offset="8180853">The main answer to your question, Justice O'Connor, is that we have conceded that as to her, a claim that is proof against 12(d)(6) has been stated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.884" offset="8359636">They are clerical employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.270" offset="8373115">They do not seek to be president of Sumitomo America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.824" offset="8395371">They seek to move up in an orderly fashion through training programs and through their own qualifications at this point in time to the lower level management positions, and I would point out that we have record evidence in the form of the EEOC reports that show that fully 40 percent of the work force today is apparently reserved for the people who are categorized as Treaty traders, so that when counsel for Sumitomo talks about high level executives, in reality, he is talking about every single person in that company with the exception of a few white males, except clericals, so that we have a real live issue on that score which in no way has been answered by the pleadings, and must be answered by a trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.884" offset="8667567">I would like to say that we are presenting here two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.157" offset="8700690">First, we claim that Sumitomo Shoji America is a domestic corporation, and therefore it has no rights under Article VIII of the Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.999" offset="8760040">That is, the of their choice provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.149" offset="8768609">Second, we claim that even if Article VIII were to apply to an American subsidiary, then the of their choice language would not exempt Sumitomo from American civil rights laws, and would not grant it a license to discriminate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.090" offset="9012383">There may well be some advantages which have not been developed in this record at this point between functioning as a domestic subsidiary and functioning as a branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.915" offset="9063688">One of them could be in the field of tax Secondly, you could have bankruptcy questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.118" offset="9080511">Thirdly, you could have questions as to immunity from jurisdiction of suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.770" offset="9099110">It seems to me there are many possibilities why a patient in Japan might well choose the protection of using a corporate form here, a domestic corporate form rather than appearing in this country as a branch, and I think that some of those have been developed in my brief, some of those have been developed and alluded to, I think, in both the government brief and also in the amicus AJC et al. brief, and I think those well could be significant, but I don't think we have that burden of trying to resolve that question because, contrary to counsel for Sumitomo's statement that the Treaty is ambiguous, it is not ambiguous at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.122" offset="9304537">Section 22-3 has a precise definition and precisely states that companies such as Sumitomo will be treated as American corporations, not corporations of Japan, and Article VIII within the article refers to situations involving both nationals and companies of Japan in the very first sentence, which discusses the VIII refers to a situation where a subsidiary corporation would gain certain rights, and that is the situation where accountants and other experts are needed by the subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.869" offset="9495544">So, you start out here in your analysis by looking at this case from its plain language, and it seems to me that once you do that, the burden is really on Sumitomo to overcome a very clear situation, because I do understand there are cases from this Court indicating that you can look behind plain language, but certainly plain language is very important.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.830" offset="9967420">But you see, when you look at the Atwood letter, you know, as we know now, that certain documents were available to Atwood that apparently Marks didn't consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.738" offset="10010992">For example, there is a very, very long communication which we discuss in our brief relating to the concept of subsidiaries being put into Article VI(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.978" offset="10063969">Now, you have a back and forth in the correspondence between Japan and the United States about Article VI(4), and the State Department concludes that Article VI the way it was originally written would not protect subsidiaries from certain problems, namely, expropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.694" offset="10162816">In order to ensure that subsidiaries had that protection, VI(4) was put in, which put into that section the concept of protecting a controlled corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.152" offset="10208687">So, when Mr. Atwood was evaluating the Treaty, he was able to look at the negotiating documents, which made clear that it wasn't accidental as to which sections referred to controlled corporations and which sections didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.242" offset="10652978">I would like to turn to a major argument of counsel for Sumitomo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.912" offset="10679727">Even though I believe that Sumitomo, given the plain language of the Treaty, has the burden of persuasion, counsel attempts to put that burden on us, and says, we have not shown any reason whatsoever for the distinction between branches and subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.027" offset="10776171">I would suggest that if Your Honors look at the section in our brief concerning legislative history, which is the section involving what the State Department representatives said to Senator Hickenlooper and his committee when this Treaty and the series of treaties in 1952 were presented to that body, that... those questions and answers and those statements are very significant, because they tell us what we all know from understanding our history, and that was, back in 1950, and throughout, that entire period, the United States Senate was very, very concerned about the rights of Americans and American entities, and the mood of the Senate was that it would object to treaties which infringed upon American sovereignty at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.352" offset="11025484">Very clearly, the State Department representatives, who not only had the burden of convincing foreign governments to sign treaties, but also had the burden of convincing the Senate to ratify those treaties, was trying to do everything that it could possibly do to let the Senate know that it was not taking away from either the federal government or state governments their traditional powers to regulate corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.158" offset="11156723">And if we have to speculate as to why people would make that type of distinction between branches and corporations, we have the dialogues in those two hearings which tell us very, very clearly that Senator Hickenlooper was extremely concerned lest this Treaty would take away the traditional rights of the state governments to regulate corporations, and each and every time that question was asked of State Department representatives over a period of two years, the State Department representative made clear that this Treaty and its companion Treaties would take nothing away from the states to regulate... to regulate in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.792" offset="11371240">Now, that is very, very significant, because in 1953, as we have pointed out in our brief, there were states that had antidiscrimination laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.350" offset="11417425">Those laws were in effect, and it is clear that it was not the purpose of Congress or of the Senate in ratifying these treaties to in any way infringe upon the States of New York, where Sumitomo is incorporated, to enforce its law, or other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.970" offset="11651900">The Attorney General has filed an amicus brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.858" offset="11667469">And more importantly, Senator Hickenlooper and his committee was very concerned that these treaties would not erode the powers of the states to regulate domestic corporations, and that is precisely what Sumitomo America is, and I suggest if we have to look for an answer as to why the Treaty was structured in this way, we may well look to those Congressional hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.345" offset="11997448">"upon as favorable terms as the nationals of the country, the right of the owner to manage his own affairs and employ personnel of his own choice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.552" offset="12042274">Now, Sumitomo maintains that Article VIII sets up a non-contingent right, that it is an absolute right, and yet the State Department representative very clearly told the Senate committee in question that the right was to be upon as favorable terms as the nationals of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.833" offset="12135374">That is a contingent right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.518" offset="12142166">That is not right which is non-contingent, because it must be the same right as is available to nationals at home.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.435" offset="12249791">I would like therefore to suggest that at the point in time that this Treaty was passed, it was perfectly appropriate for Congress to pass Title VII and not have that statute be in conflict with this particular Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.033" offset="12340174">More than that, it is very clear that the parties could have contemplated the passage of Title VII, because of the U.N. charter provisions which are in our brief and concepts of equality which were developing at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.812" offset="12411332">Secondly, I point out that Title VII has specific exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.535" offset="12454173">Congress well understood, and I have a section in my brief about that, that it could exempt certain areas from Title VII protection, and in fact did so, and did so in two areas relating to foreign policy, and those sections are also set forth in my brief.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3362.986" offset="13584021">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in the view of the United States, the dispositive issue before this Court at the present stage of the case is whether the special employment privilege of Article VIII is conferred on a subsidiary incorporated in the host country, such as the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.053" offset="13688302">The answer given by the Treaty's text is that that privilege is not conferred on such a subsidiary, and the contracting parties to the Treaty are in agreement that the textual answer is the correct one, that the Treaty means what it says in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.567" offset="13774297">Now, the Court has noted that the views of the contracting parties to a treaty are entitled to great weight, and I think that principle applies particularly when we are talking about the interpretation of a provision that is obviously meant to impose reciprocal obligations because it is only by a decision agreeing with the views of the contracting parties that the actual application of the reciprocal obligation can be assured, and otherwise, there is some question introduced that will cause questions to be resolved in our international relations of whether reciprocity can be preserved if the views of the contracting parties are determined not to be the correct views.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.839" offset="14007413">Now, the view of the Japanese government is consistent with the view you have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.476" offset="14026013">Is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3474.443" offset="14029879">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.959" offset="14031864">One thing that we have set forth with great clarity is that both governments, and the Japanese government has consistently taken this position, agree on the meaning of Article VIII of the Treaty with respect to subsidiaries incorporated in the host country, and this view comports completely with the plain text of the Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.660" offset="14138653">It is only by going behind that text for other reasons that the court below or the Fifth Circuit reached a contrary result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.099" offset="14176478">The definition that appears, and the text of the pertinent provisions is set forth in Petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.372" offset="14213572">The definition that appears in Article XXII, which is set forth on Page 5 of that brief, is one of four subsections of that article, all of which are definitional in nature, and none of which would have any function in the Treaty unless they were to illuminate the usage of terms in other provisions of the Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.989" offset="14312001">There is no other meaning to Article XXII of the Treaty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3551.059" offset="14336243">In your view, should we stop there, Mr. Wallace, or should we go on and resolve the question raised about the difficulty of interpreting who is covered by the Treaty trader?</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.455" offset="14409908">Well, I don't really think there is a difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.607" offset="14426522">Perhaps I should turn to that immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.975" offset="14435926">I was just going to further elucidate about Article VIII itself, gives an example of the usage of these terms in a way, in the second sentence of Article VIII, it is obviously designed to draw a distinction between the subsidiary incorporated in the host country which would not be allowed to have accountants and others practicing for it who could not qualify under local law, whereas the parent in the foreign country would be allowed to send in such a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.134" offset="14580645">And right there, in Article VIII itself, the distinction is drawn for a very plausible reason, and there is no reason to think that the first sentence of Article VIII means anything different, and let me try to clarify what has been said about our discussion of Treaty trader visas, because I think considerable confusion has been introduced by the Petitioner's contention that the securing of a Treaty trader visa in any way illuminates the rights of the employing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.025" offset="14740200">All we meant on Page 6 of our brief, in the sentence that was quoted, if one hypothesizes that as we contend, Title VII applies to the subsidiary and to its hiring decisions, nonetheless, the Treaty, through Article I and through Article VII, gives the subsidiary rights with respect to its operations here, and it can consider Japanese nationals in filling its positions, and it can do that consistently with Title VII either on a non-discriminatory basis by deciding that the Japanese national is the better qualified person for a particular position, or by showing as a matter of business necessity that others need not be considered for that position.</text>

            <text syncTime="3718.919" offset="15007694">It is a right under Title VII, but what is needed from the Treaty is the way to get that person into the country to be employed, and that is what is conferred by Article I of the Treaty and by the Immigration and Naturalization law that allows these people to come in under Treaty trader visas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3746.570" offset="15118349">No, the Treaty only... through Article VII the Treaty gives them the very valuable right of standing on an equal footing with other companies incorporated in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.810" offset="15167250">The heart of the Treaty, as it has been defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.312" offset="15177281">But this has no implications for whether Title VII applies or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.566" offset="15202359">All we are pointing out in this first part of the discussion is that they can bring in a Japanese national, but in doing so they might or might not be violating someone else's rights under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.641" offset="15254604">That is a separate question, and when a consular official issues a visa, all that official is determining is whether the individual applying to him qualifies for the visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.365" offset="15305490">He makes no determination about the company's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.917" offset="15319701">The consular official sees to it that the individual who has applied to him for the visa has been offered a job in the United States that qualifies as one of the jobs for which he is entitled to the issuance of a visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.628" offset="15386574">It may be that the company in offering him that job has violated someone else's Title VII rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.216" offset="15416876">That is a separate question that is not even addressed, and need not be addressed by the consular official, because it has nothing to do with his right to the visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.405" offset="15453657">Even if it were later determined that Title VII were violated by that appointment, Title VII remedies do not bump an incumbent employee out of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.195" offset="15496811">So, it would have nothing to do with his right to enter the United States to take the job, and we were talking about something quite separate on Page 21 when we talked about the possibility that the parent company may claim a right to assign certain persons to the subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.811" offset="15591270">It is premature in this case to know whether that question is presented at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.715" offset="15610914">On the face of things, all of these people are employees of the subsidiary, and there has been no proof made that any of them were assigned to the subsidiary by the parent company, nor do we know yet the circumstances under which that assignment was made, whether it really could be argued to have been made in exercise of the parent company's treaty right to manage and control the subsidiary, or whether it might have been, for example, just part of a training program for the parent company's personnel, to give them some experience here and there, so that they will be better employees in the parent company in future years, which would raise a different question of whether there is a right under the Treaty to assign persons for that kind of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.135" offset="15840582">The record simply is not developed enough to address, in our view, any question other than the Article VIII question on which the contracting parties agree and the language of the Treaty is clear, and in response to this, all the Petitioners have been able to do is try to introduce some possible ambiguities or inconsistencies in the negotiating history or the subsequent interpretation of the Treaty, and that cannot be enough to overturn the meaning of the plain language agreed to by the contracting parties.</text>
