            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments first this morning in Tibbs against Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.520" offset="106789">Mr. Beller, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis R. Beller</label>
            <text syncTime="16.040" offset="140957">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.411" offset="154436">I received the briefs, both the brief of the United States as amicus curiae and the answering brief from the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.383" offset="198322">I think the question has been misstated in the answering brief for the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.787" offset="223922">The question that they cite is whether the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy precludes retrial of the Petitioner where the appellate court, acting as a thirteenth juror, assessed the credibility of the witnesses and re-weighed the evidence, concluding that although the evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to sustain the verdicts, the Petitioner should be afforded a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.703" offset="307513">I think the question is just pure and simple, as stated in my original brief, whether or not the double jeopardy applies where the Court has grounds for retrial under the double jeopardy clause because of the fact that the court originally weighed and found the evidence insufficient to convict the Petitioner.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_r_beller" startTime="82.584" stopTime="94.059">
            <label>Mr. Louis R. Beller</label>
            <text syncTime="82.584" offset="407092">Mr. Tibbs is in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.620" offset="419213">He was... on the motion to dismiss, the case was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.088" offset="433110">He was out on bond at that particular time, but of course the bond would then be dropped.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="94.059" offset="452963">But he is not incarcerated now?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_r_beller" startTime="96.042" stopTime="229.847">
            <label>Mr. Louis R. Beller</label>
            <text syncTime="96.042" offset="460904">No, he is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.728" offset="463621">The question of double jeopardy, as opposed to weight, is presented in the Government's brief as amicus curiae, and they say it would affect Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.322" offset="538018">Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure applies to the trial court, who in effect is sitting as a thirteenth juror, because the trial court does see the evidence, does see the witnesses, weighs the credibility of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.867" offset="612206">I don't think anything that this Court does in the Delbert Tibbs case should have any effect upon Rule 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.492" offset="654733">I think that's a good rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.241" offset="657763">The trial court sitting as a thirteenth juror... that's the trial court, not an appellate court... has the same opportunity as the parties who are the jurors to weigh the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.484" offset="710635">And if the trial court feels under Rule 33 that there should be a new trial, it orders a new trial in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.007" offset="744803">Now, what happened in this particular case is that the appellate court of the State of Florida, the Supreme Court, who is the direct court of appeals in a murder trial, under Rule 9.140 of the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure... or Appellate Procedure... (f), did review the case and reviewed the totality of the case, did, as it is required to do, did a total review of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.978" offset="876669">And I'm sure the Court is aware of the various points of evidence that it did review.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.565" offset="899030">But what it did was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.815" offset="908016">It said that this evidence is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.969" offset="924630">It didn't use that phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.321" offset="934034">It said that the evidence was... there were insufficiencies in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.427" offset="970501">There were things about the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.395" offset="986279">And then it went on to list--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="229.847" stopTime="237.853">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="229.847" offset="996101">Did they not say in effect there was not enough evidence here for the jury to reach the verdict that it reached?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_r_beller" startTime="237.853" stopTime="311.651">
            <label>Mr. Louis R. Beller</label>
            <text syncTime="237.853" offset="1028180">--Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.753" offset="1031732">They concluded that there was not enough evidence for a reasonable man to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.661" offset="1075409">And that's weighing the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.613" offset="1087216">And they concluded by saying, rather than risk the very real possibility that Tibbs had nothing to do with these crimes, we reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.669" offset="1131416">Now, this happened prior to this Court's decision in Burks and Greene, and there was a concurring opinion by Justice Boyd at that particular time, who said, I believe that this man should not be retried, but under the current law he probably can be retried.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.065" offset="1209051">Burks and Greene, if my understanding of them is correct, said simply this: that where a trial court... where an appellate court reweighs the evidence and finds that the evidence is not enough to convict beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt, that it's the same as finding that there is insufficient evidence and that he cannot retry them under the double jeopardy clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="311.651" stopTime="330.963">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="311.651" offset="1323363">Mr. Beller, I thought the trial court simply made a determination that in the interest of justice the Defendant should have a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.424" offset="1358472">They pointed out seven so-called weaknesses in the state's case and then said there should be a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.946" offset="1396506">Isn't that so?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_r_beller" startTime="330.963" stopTime="402.826">
            <label>Mr. Louis R. Beller</label>
            <text syncTime="330.963" offset="1400581">When they reviewed their initial decision, yes, they said there should be a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.736" offset="1435690">But that was prior to Burks and Greene, and Burks and Greene simply set up the proposition that you did not waive the right to the double jeopardy clause by asking for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.143" offset="1485322">I think previous to that the law was that if you applied to an appellate court for a new trial and the court granted you a new trial, it was simply doing what you asked for and you had waived your right to the double jeopardy clause when you got your new trial, even if it was a question of evidentiary insufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.707" offset="1563585">And the problem here is, what did they reverse on.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.659" offset="1575393">They did set up a series of nine various deficiencies, and they all go to evidentiary weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.229" offset="1601620">None of them go to any question of a legal insufficiency, whether or not he had admitted something improperly, whether or not a question had been asked that should have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.655" offset="1659402">None of these were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.257" offset="1665776">So it was a question of whether or not the entire evidence was sufficient to convict.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="402.826" stopTime="409.065">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="402.826" offset="1688033">Well, in their second opinion they certainly take a different view of what they did in their first opinion than you do.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_r_beller" startTime="409.065" stopTime="511.964">
            <label>Mr. Louis R. Beller</label>
            <text syncTime="409.065" offset="1713006">Let me apply it to the second opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.717" offset="1735576">The second opinion, through the fifth section of the second opinion... in fact, when I read the second opinion... and you'll find that the dissenting judges all concur in it through Roman numeral number V, their fifth section, which is the majority of the second opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.613" offset="1811226">The second opinion reviews the District Court, the Second District Court of Appeals opinion, which said that he should be retried because the reversal was not based on insufficiency, but was based on weight of the evidence, that though there was enough evidence to legally convict Tibbs, yet because of the weight in the interest of justice they felt he should have a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.448" offset="1922508">They went through and reviewed it, the majority in second opinion, and they said, well, weight and insufficiency are so close we're never going to do that again.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.924" offset="1972454">In fact, quoting from their second opinion... and this is from the Joint Appendix on page 19:</text>
            <text syncTime="484.896" offset="2016340">"Henceforth, no appellate court should reverse a conviction or judgment on the grounds that the weight of the evidence is tenuous or insubstantial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="494.602" offset="2055105">"Cases now pending on appeal which a court has characterized the reversal as based on evidentiary weight should be reconsidered in light of our decision today, and under the doctrine of Burks and Greene any retrial of those cases may or may not be barred on the basis of former jeopardy. "</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="511.964" stopTime="541.733">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="511.964" offset="2124591">Well, let me call your attention to page 22 of the Joint Appendix, which is part of part five of the court's second opinion, down at the bottom of the page where they say:</text>
            <text syncTime="523.437" offset="2170462">"The fact remains that we cannot fairly conclude from our original opinion that Tibbs' convictions were reversed on the grounds of evidentiary insufficiency. "</text>
            <text syncTime="531.708" offset="2203585">Now, don't you agree that at least the second time around in interpreting their first opinion they said that they had not reversed for evidentiary insufficiency?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_r_beller" startTime="541.733" stopTime="853.564">
            <label>Mr. Louis R. Beller</label>
            <text syncTime="541.733" offset="2243709">I would agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.699" offset="2251546">What they said is that they're never going to do it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.718" offset="2263667">But what they said is that in this particular case they had reversed on the weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.939" offset="2284460">Now, there really have been no Supreme Court cases that establish weight versus insufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.108" offset="2309224">And as I said, through paragraph five... I thought, in fact, when I read the case through number five, I thought I had won the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.133" offset="2349244">I thought that they were going to let Tibbs go.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.800" offset="2355931">And if you look at the concurring opinions... the dissenting opinions, they all agree through paragraph five, because the court does, it dissects... dissects; pardon me... the original application of weight versus insufficiency, and says it's too hard to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.932" offset="2448509">In fact, they went through... if you look at, and I'm sure you have... but they went through and delineated all the cares in Florida that had used the weight theory and said that they were very tenuous, and that most of these cases were reversed on insufficient evidence, and therefore, as I said before, they then concluded that no court should reverse on the weight again.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.701" offset="2563553">However, they left in effect Rule 9.140(f) of the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure, and that rule says:</text>
            <text syncTime="635.359" offset="2618201">"In the interest of justice, the court may grant any relief to which any of the parties is entitled in capital cases. "</text>
            <text syncTime="643.046" offset="2648921">"In capital cases. "</text>
            <text syncTime="644.029" offset="2652891">--and this was a capital case...</text>
            <text syncTime="644.898" offset="2656340">"court shall review the evidence to determine if the interest of justice requires a new trial, whether or not insufficiency of the evidence is an issue presented for review. "</text>
            <text syncTime="654.921" offset="2696464">But then they went on to say that if a court does under 9.140 review the insufficiency of the evidence to determine whether or not it's sufficient and reverses... and this is, I'm quoting from 21, the second paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.936" offset="2784444">This is from the Joint Appendix:</text>
            <text syncTime="680.304" offset="2797923">"With respect to the special mention of capital cases in the second sentence of the rule, we take that sentence to mean no more than that an additional review requirement is imposed when insufficiency of the evidence is not specifically raised on appeal... namely, that the reviewing court shall consider sufficiency anyhow and, if it warranted, reverse the conviction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="703.084" offset="2889038">"The consequence of that action would be to bar retrial under the double jeopardy clause. "</text>
            <text syncTime="709.321" offset="2914011">They're saying if a court does review the sufficiency of the evidence it would bar it.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.223" offset="2933656">Now, I raised this point in my brief and I think it's important to raise the point, because it's a question of interpretation of what the court originally said.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.514" offset="2978795">The three dissents here, the three justices that say that the evidence was insufficient, and there is a very... and I quoted extensively from Justice Sundberg's opinion in my brief, because I think he said it better than I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.661" offset="3055386">But the three justices there were part of the original majority that had reversed for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.481" offset="3078687">There was only one justice of the original majority that didn't join in, and the reason he didn't join in is because he wasn't on the court, as far as I could determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.935" offset="3112438">And nobody can read the man's mind, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.621" offset="3123200">But what I'm saying is that the people who wrote the opinion... Justice England, who wrote the opinion, the original opinion, said in the interest of justice we should let him go.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.579" offset="3163115">What he's doing is applying... and he did quote Rule 9.140(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="776.966" offset="3184640">What he's doing is saying, under Rule 9.140(f), as the majority said here, we reviewed the evidence, we found it insufficient, therefore double jeopardy bars a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.623" offset="3239288">In the interest of justice he should not be retried.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.325" offset="3250051">And he did it very shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.944" offset="3260500">Justice Englander in his dissent said, I agree with the court through part five.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.348" offset="3282129">I agree with the court through part five, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.616" offset="3295190">Justice Sundberg in his dissent started out with saying, I agree with the court through part five.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.204" offset="3317551">Because through part five the court says, we shouldn't use the standard of weight or insufficiency, because weight is too tenuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.344" offset="3362168">And then they finally come they do come to the conclusion in this particular case that they had made an error, that they had used the standard of weight rather than insufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.533" offset="3402919">And they said we could do three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.635" offset="3411278">We could vacate our original order and say that we shouldn't have reversed and sustain the original conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.025" offset="3452865">We can send back for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.210" offset="3461538">Or we could release him.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.895" offset="3468330">And we think of the three we should do the medium thing, which is send back for a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1985.749" offset="8019696">Well, one thing I think throughout the country I would say pretty much universally... perhaps there are some exceptions... the courts throughout the country for the last century have been saying appellate courts should not reweigh the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.961" offset="8092630">And we learned this in law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.413" offset="8098377">You know, it's one of the elementary principals of appellate law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.964" offset="8116558">Yet, time and time again appellate courts do reweigh the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.835" offset="8132127">It's a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.501" offset="8138710">I have read dissenting opinions of this Court where the dissent says the majority here reweighs the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.724" offset="8175595">I believe also this Court has written majority opinions saying that the dissent is reweighing the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.397" offset="8206315">So we have an area of law which it appears that very often courts try to dodge or evade, and courts are continuously reweighing the evidence, even though they say that they aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.390" offset="8262322">But in any event, the law in the State of Florida in this particular case perhaps is not clear that the courts can't reweigh the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.362" offset="8306207">And I would refer the Court to the opinion of the Second District Court of Appeal, which is in the appendix, where the Second District Court of Appeal cites at least ten cases in the State of Florida where appellate courts had reweighed the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.490" offset="8378723">So the fact of the matter is that there is a bulk of caselaw in Florida which has the effect of saying that in Florida the appellate courts up until that time can reweigh the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.350" offset="8438178">Now, in this case not only did the Florida Supreme Court rule that Tibbs' reversal was not based upon evidentiary insufficiency; the court ruled that it had improperly reweighed the evidence and described Tibbs' reversal as an appellate reversal improperly entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.782" offset="8531905">So the Florida Supreme Court has conceded that it reweighed the evidence and has described its earlier decision as an appellate reversal improperly entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.740" offset="8575687">And the court went on to state:</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.592" offset="8583105">"We could simply apply the principles enunciated in today's decision, vacate our previous reversal, and affirm Tibbs' conviction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.564" offset="8626991">So not only was Tibbs' reversal not an acquittal here; it should not even have been a reversal, according to the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.788" offset="8671922">Here retrial doer not give the State a second choice... excuse me... a second chance to supply evidence that it failed to muster in the first trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.059" offset="11053035">There was the corroborating testimony of Tibbs' jailmate, who testified that Tibbs had told him he committed the 36 murder and went into some detail, stated that he, Tibbs, had told him that he was driving down the road in Fort Myer when he saw a couple hitchhiking, and he mentioned the name of the road, Cleveland or Fowler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.930" offset="11172467">Tibbs told his cellmate that he, on the pretense of running out of gas, he went out into a field where there was some farm machinery, presumably to siphon gas out of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.308" offset="11749982">Because in that case they said they had based their opinion upon insufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.545" offset="11774955">So the Florida Supreme Court... there's no showing that the Florida Supreme Court used its second opinion as a means of somehow evading the Burks opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.434" offset="11818527">As the Florida Supreme Court stated in its second opinion, prior to Burks there was no reason whatsoever to be precise in your language concerning evidentiary insufficiency, because Burks broke with a long line of precedent reaching all the way back to 1896, United States versus Ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.033" offset="11908911">So there was no reason for the Florida Supreme Court to believe in the first case that this question would ever arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.539" offset="11938900">And I don't see any problem with the Florida Supreme Court coming back with a second opinion saying, this is what we meant, and being precise with our language here now that we know what Burks is the law, this is what we meant when we came out with our first opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.732" offset="12007654">Now, the Petitioner incorrectly analyzes United States v. Scott in his brief, and comes up with a nice neat test, that there are two categories: one is reversals based on fact, which means there must be an acquittal; and the other is reversals based on trial error, under which case there cannot be an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.738" offset="12147670">But the Petitioner fails to recognize the distinction between a dismissal at trial and a reversal on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.863" offset="12188212">At trial where there's a dismissal you're taking the case away from a jury which might well find the defendant not guilty, whereas on appeal we know that the jury has found the defendant guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.455" offset="12246518">In this case the 12 jurors said Tibbs is guilty of first degree murder and rape, and for that reason there are... the test in Scott is not the same test used in Burks, because the test in Scott does not work on an appellate reversal, because every appellate reversal based upon facts isn't necessarily an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.457" offset="12362606">In Burks this Court said that an acquittal after the court reversed must mean that the evidence should never even have gone to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.651" offset="12423314">The appellate court in this case, in the first Burks case, never said or even hinted that the evidence should not have gone to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.290" offset="12469917">The never said that the trial court erred in not granting an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.463" offset="12498651">So for these reasons, the nice neat package we have in Scott, where we have two categories... reversal based upon facts and reversal based upon trial error... does not work on an appeal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.691" offset="12575556">On an appeal situation we must have two different categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.078" offset="12593110">We have... and this is, I think, supported by Burks... those categories are reversals based upon evidentiary insufficiency and every other ground for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.088" offset="12653087">On reversals based upon evidentiary insufficiency, the double jeopardy clause applies and the state cannot retry the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.444" offset="12690495">On every other ground for reversal the double jeopardy clause does not apply and the state can retry the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3241.918" offset="13044402">I think that's the problem that this Court faced in Greene and Burks, the old problem of, if you ask for a new trial you waive your right to double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.607" offset="13079197">Certainly any defendant faced with the possibility of either affirmation of a conviction or a new trial will take the new trial, if the court put it in that blunt words.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.038" offset="13164878">Because subsequent this Court said that's exactly what we should win, that we don't waive our rights to new trial... pardon me, I may have answered you wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.665" offset="13235409">You think that if you'd have taken the new trial that in the trial court you could have moved successfully to dismiss the case on double jeopardy grounds?</text>
