            <label>Mr. Jay C. Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="119.327" offset="612247">He would be about 20 now.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.445" offset="624786">This happened in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.862" offset="630428">Twenty years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.197" offset="635757">Because of the treatment of the case by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and by the state in its brief, one special point should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.039" offset="683195">We are not here talking about accountability or criminal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.525" offset="705138">I concede to the state their right to fix the age of criminal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.179" offset="727708">The state in essence asked for that latitude which they receive under the due process clause under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.766" offset="758010">It is our position this is a very narrow issue, the imposition of the death penalty upon a 16-year-old child.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.189" offset="791760">Whatever age the state wishes to fix for relinquishing children to the adult court system, I grant their power.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.462" offset="820809">There is in my argument one assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.497" offset="832929">That assumption is that there is an age somewhere below which it is cruel and unusual punishment to put a child to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.536" offset="873158">The question is, what is that age?</text>
            <text syncTime="187.554" offset="885174">In Gregg, this Court stated that death is a punishment unique in its severity and irrevocability, different in kind from any other punishment imposed, and indeed it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.112" offset="931463">In subsequent cases such as Lockett and Woodson, the Court stated it is necessary to focus upon the particular character of the defendant to determine if the punishment is proportionate to the offense and to the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.872" offset="986529">This Court has on innumerable occasions acknowledged youth as a most mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.276" offset="1020071">In fact, in every instance in which the Court has made reference to mitigating factors or given examples of them, youth has been in there.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="230.333" offset="1056329">Well, the Oklahoma court allowed and focused on youth as a mitigating factor here, did it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay C. Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="239.106" offset="1091437">That is another problem in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.822" offset="1098229">The trial judge made the finding that he was precluded by Oklahoma law from considering as a mitigating circumstance the background of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.378" offset="1136472">He did consider youth, but he made the statement that he could not consider anything else, and of course, we think that is in violation of Lockett.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="268.423" offset="1208675">Did that mean the whole background, and is that how the Court of Appeals treated it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay C. Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="273.624" offset="1229468">I understand it to mean, and the Court of Criminal Appeals obviously did, the history of the boy in the juvenile system, the burglaries, the fight he was in, his trouble with his parents, being bounced from one home to another home.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.551" offset="1289236">If that is true, if that is what the court meant, and then did not consider it, I guess the Lockett case was decided shortly afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.525" offset="1333122">Do we have to then consider remanding on the basis of having the court consider these other mitigating circumstances in your view?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay C. Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="310.583" offset="1377321">That would certainly be one solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.983" offset="1382964">Lockett would mandate a remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.957" offset="1430820">The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in considering that issue merely made the statement that the juvenile knew right from wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.861" offset="1454435">Therefore, he can be put to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.094" offset="1463316">They begged the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.646" offset="1469586">They used the McNaughton test of sanity to determine whether or not a juvenile could be put to death.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.900" offset="1494559">Lockett was decided in 1978 and the Court of Criminal Appeals opinion came down in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.656" offset="1525592">Why wasn't that raised in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals?</text>

            <text syncTime="355.393" offset="1556521">It should have been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.261" offset="1564044">But under the Oklahoma statute, it was incumbent upon the court to consider these mitigating circumstances anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.748" offset="1589958">The Oklahoma statutes provide for automatic appeal, and they state certain findings the appellate court must make to affirm any sentence of death, and among those is a comparison of other cases and the consideration of mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.675" offset="1649726">Our court just didn't do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.213" offset="7635842">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the facts of this case reveal that the Petitioner in this case, Monty Eddings, was 16 years old at the time he intentionally murdered an Oklahoma highway patrol trooper, a man by the name of Larry Crabtree, with a sawed-off shotgun as the trooper approached the vehicle which Mr. Eddings had been driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.483" offset="7752871">The murder occurred after Mr. Eddings announced to the other members of the car that he would blow the trooper away if he hassled him, then loaded the sawed-off shotgun, waited as the trooper approached, and fired the shotgun, striking him in the heart from a distance of approximately six or seven feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.027" offset="7831133">The issues in this case are, Number One, whether the United States Constitution prohibits a state from imposing a penalty of death in every case involving a person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the crime without a consideration of the circumstances of the offense and without a consideration of the character and record of the individual defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.227" offset="7919950">The Petitioners also raise the question whether or not the punishment imposed in this case, the penalty of death, by a person who was 16 years old at the time of the commission of the crime for the crime of the intentional murder of a law enforcement officer is disproportionate, in violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.288" offset="7992152">The state contends that the adoption of a chronological age as the sole determinative factor in making the decision as to whether to impose the penalty of death to the exclusion of all other considerations has support neither in reason nor in the previous decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.816" offset="8062265">We submit that under the facts and circumstances of this individual case, that Oklahoma's decision to impose the death penalty upon the Petitioner who intentionally murdered one of our law enforcement officers does not violate the Eighth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2113.580" offset="8589311">Like I say, I don't think the objective factors which the Court used in striking down Georgia's death penalty, when it noted that Georgia was the only state in the union that imposed the penalty of death for the crime of rape... I think that in that case it could look toward the 50 states and see that a very small minority of states would impose a penalty of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.011" offset="8671022">Also, I don't anticipate that Oklahoma will ever be in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.446" offset="8684815">I am glad of the fact that we only have one individual on our death row that is in this position, and I would hate to be in the position of arguing, look, we've got a number of juveniles on death row, that shows that it is not cruel and unusual punishment to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.873" offset="8742493">I think we have been... the cases cited by the Petitioner have shown that we have been very careful in making that decision, and have not abused our discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.430" offset="8784707">However, the facts in this case support our decision to impose the death penalty, considering the victim and the character and record of this individual defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.684" offset="8817726">We urge the Court to uphold the punishment of death in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.321" offset="8840296">We ask the Court to recognize that we have covered and followed our own certification procedures very carefully in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.610" offset="8869449">We have found that under our statute on certification, the test being if the individual is able to make a distinction between right and wrong and is to be held accountable for his acts in accordance with eight specific guidelines.</text>

            <label>Mr. David W. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="2218.381" offset="9008524">Well, certification statutes in general are an admission by the state that there is a certain time in life when we don't know whether an individual should be held accountable for his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.789" offset="9046141">As this Court noted in Breed versus Jones, an overwhelming number of jurisdictions in this country have certification procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.943" offset="9074771">So does the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.578" offset="9081354">And we think that if we admit that we are not able to make that decision on every 16-year-old person, as long as we followed our statute in that regard in this case, which we think we have, as long as the sentencer has found one or more aggravating circumstances, pursuant to our death penalty statute, in order to guide him in his discretion, as long as he has taken age to be a mitigating circumstance, as he did in this case, we feel like the death penalty should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.296" offset="9192218">In the case of Bell versus Ohio, this Court reversed a conviction of a person who was 16 years old at the time of the commission of the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.835" offset="9230356">It said that the Ohio statute was incorrect because it prohibited the sentencer from taking into consideration such things such as the age of the defendant, but this Court in that decision did not in any way suggest or imply that the age of the offender, Mr. Bell in that case, would be considered to be anything more than one of several mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.815" offset="9314262">We ask that this Court's decision in that case and in Lockett, and Woodson not be extended to completely bar the execution of persons who were 16 years old at the time of the commission of the crime without a consideration of their background, character, and the circumstances surrounding the individual offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.527" offset="9385106">We believe that the adoption by this Court of a chronological age below which the state could never go in imposing the penalty of death would create an arbitrary and artificial line in the determination of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.952" offset="9434843">As I stated earlier, by analogy, this Court, when requested to adopt a six-month guideline within which a defendant in a criminal case should receive a trial under the mandates of the speedy trial provision of the Sixth Amendment, this Court declined to do so, setting forth factors for the trial court to weigh and consider in making a determination whether the speedy trial provision of the Sixth Amendment had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.735" offset="9537974">We feel like the determination by the state as far as the accountability and responsibility of a criminal defendant, if anything, is a much more complex decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.792" offset="9578203">Furthermore, as we have stated in our brief, we contend that the legislatures in this country should be allowed to respond to sociological and technological changes which may occur in their society, and to recognize that younger people in this country are becoming mature at an earlier age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.504" offset="9656988">We feel like the state should be allowed to react to the increase in and the horror of juvenile crime, and to impose the penalty of death in a proper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.460" offset="9692828">We think that the record in this case is Oklahoma's best record that the penalty of death should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.716" offset="9717906">The facts as I have stated earlier reveal a murder which by all standards and definitions was an intentional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.535" offset="9749148">It was undertaken with malice aforethought, which is required by our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.004" offset="9763045">We have an individual defendant who at the time of the commission of the murder by all accounts was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.093" offset="9791362">He is an individual who the other occupants of the vehicle attempted to persuade him not to shoot the trooper as he approached the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.949" offset="9826784">This includes three people in the car who were younger than the Petitioner, two 14-year-old people and a 15-year-old person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.370" offset="9856459">They all testified they tried to stop him from killing the trooper as he approached the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.174" offset="9875685">He is an individual who, according to the testimony of the four expert witnesses on the subject of his mental status who testified, according to none of them was he insane or psychotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.731" offset="9921870">All the doctors testified that he knew the difference between right or wrong, that he was not mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.266" offset="9944022">Even in his own... even his own expert witnesses... he had a psychologist who testified, and he contended that his problem was the fact that he had an antisocial behavior problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.894" offset="10010582">He was a sociopath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.827" offset="10014343">Both the psychiatrists that testified for the Petitioner stated that he was not the victim of parental abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.231" offset="10039943">Dr. Gagliano, who testified... who was the psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the Petitioner stated that he knew the difference between right or wrong at the time he pulled the trigger, but that it did not apply to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.872" offset="10086441">He said that there was something wrong with Mr. Eddings' personality, but there was nothing wrong with his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.943" offset="10110787">He also testified, as did the other psychiatrist, that there was no thinking disorder, no psychosis, and that he knew the difference between right or wrong, as I stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.299" offset="10156136">Also, the testimony of his juvenile probation officer from the state of Missouri, Steven Dorn, testified, "Monty is sharp".</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.905" offset="10186647">He stated he was an individual of average intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.439" offset="10200753">In addition, we have an individual who expressed absolutely no remorse for what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.343" offset="10220397">This was evidenced by statements he made to the other law enforcement officers in jail after he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.580" offset="10245266">He stated at one point,</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.520" offset="10277031">He made the statement immediately after the murder to two law enforcement officers,</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.562" offset="10769282">That was one of the issues he raised, and the Court of Criminal Appeals said that the family background of the Petitioner was useful in explaining why he behaved the way he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.204" offset="10807839">It does not excuse his behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.354" offset="10816407">So I suppose indirectly they dealt with that particular part of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.533" offset="10897073">It could mean, and I think... my interpretation of it is that the trial court did not consider the fact of his family background as a mitigating circumstance.</text>
