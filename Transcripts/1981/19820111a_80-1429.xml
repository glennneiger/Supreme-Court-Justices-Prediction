            <text syncTime="64.942" offset="403747">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.144" offset="416494">This case involves an action brought under 42 USC Section 1983 by a mentally retarded resident of Pennhurst State School and Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.166" offset="456618">The plaintiff seeks damages in this action based on his treatment while there from three supervisory officials at Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.522" offset="490055">In the District Court the case was tried before a jury which found in favor of each of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.843" offset="511267">On appeal the Third Circuit vacated and remanded the case, holding that the institutionalized mentally retarded had a number of substantive due process rights, including first a right to treatment which must be acceptable in light of present scientific or medical knowledge, and also must be the least intrusive available under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.773" offset="599038">Secondly, a right to be free of restraint absent a showing of substantial or compelling necessity by the state and also a showing that the least restrictive alternative was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.481" offset="649820">And finally, it held that there was a right, a constitutional right to be protected from harm absent a showing by the state of substantial necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.289" offset="689108">Do you think there is a body of medical opinion defining what is the appropriate or proper medical treatment for each of the conditions that you're dealing with?</text>

            <text syncTime="151.798" offset="751175">--No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.298" offset="753161">As a matter of fact, that's one of the critical flaws in the Third Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="769774">This is an area where experts continue to disagree as to the types and benefits of various levels of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.808" offset="807182">And an example of the way the Third Circuit has ignored this Court's warning as to the fact that courts are poorly equipped to make medical judgments are what it has done with the treatment standards and the particular standards that would apply to the various rights which it found.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.221" offset="892863">For example, it would use such phrases as "least intrusive", "compelling necessity", "least restrictive" to those concepts.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.462" offset="945735">Absolutely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.314" offset="953154">These buzz words are difficult for the health care professionals who are responsible for implementing those standards to understand and apply, and the danger of applying such concepts in this area is to force health care professionals to make decisions not necessarily based on their professional opinion as to what is best for the mentally retarded, but rather on what the Third Circuit would require based on its decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.154" offset="1088573">A good example of the way in which the Third Circuit has made medical psychological judgments is what it has done with the concept of restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.276" offset="1133085">The Third Circuit held that the use of restraints is presumptively punitive, and to quote the court below,</text>
            <text syncTime="254.030" offset="1160044">"has been relegated to the closets of an earlier age. "</text>
            <text syncTime="257.715" offset="1174777">Nevertheless, federal regulations, the various amici organizations in this Court, and even plaintiffs recognize the use of restraints under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.940" offset="1219707">In addition, in the very limited circumstances where the court below would recognize use of restraints on the mentally retarded, it did so only for protection of the resident himself or for treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.115" offset="1276445">Once again, however, the various amici organizations and federal regulations recognize use of restraints in some circumstances either for protection of the resident or for protection of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.077" offset="1352201">Well, in this case as to the use of restraints, we don't have specific findings by the jury, but the record does reflect that the use of restraints being challenged here is use of restraints which occurred while Mr. Romeo was in the medical ward, the hospital ward at Pennhurst.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.048" offset="1484171">Your Honor, under the proper standard, which we would urge this Court to adopt, no purpose would be served by a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.088" offset="1516249">Under the proper standard the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.892" offset="1539551">Moreover, the Third Circuit has clearly in an en banc decision decided the constitutional rights of the institutionalized mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.347" offset="1577272">That decision will apply on remand in this case and will apply to all other cases, at least in the Third Circuit, so long as that decision stands.</text>

            <label>Mr. David H. Allshouse</label>
            <text syncTime="375.392" offset="1645503">Well, Your Honor, this record, in our view, contains all the facts necessary for the Court to make its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.946" offset="1675701">Under the standard we urge the Third Circuit should have adopted, the traditional due process test would apply; and that is, whether or not conditions of confinement are rationally related to some legitimate state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.157" offset="1736514">Such interest in the context of care of the mentally retarded in state institutions include provision of care, provision of treatment, protection of the resident or protection from others, and certain administrative concerns in the management of the institution.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="432.645" offset="1874545">Was this raised before the Court of Appeals?</text>

            <label>Mr. David H. Allshouse</label>
            <text syncTime="434.413" offset="1881546">--Yes, it was, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.747" offset="1886875">We did not separately raise cross appeal on the issue of good faith immunity, because when a defendant prevails in the District Court, we do not understand that is any such burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.257" offset="1936925">In the Court of Appeals in discussing the right to treatment, discussion of such cases as Wood, Procunier and Scheuer was included in our discussion of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.981" offset="1987812">Therefore, we believe the Court erred, independently of its finding of constitutional rights, in remanding the case without ruling that these individuals were entitled to immunity as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.757" offset="2050924">The immunity issue as defined by this Court's decisions reflects that there is both an objective element and a subjective element.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.632" offset="2094496">As to the objective element, the rights which we argue about today certainly were not clearly established between 1974 and 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.571" offset="2134202">As to the subjective element, the record reflects here that while Mr. Romeo suffered injuries on various occasions while he was at Pennhurst, the record also reflects that Mr. Romeo was a very aggressive, violent individual both toward himself and toward others, and that while he was at Pennhurst he sustained a number of injuries which were self inflicted, a number of injuries which occurred as a result of other patients retaliating against him for his aggressive behavior, and a number of the injuries were simply accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.815" offset="2291146">Therefore, as to that aspect there could be no finding of malice.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="542.267" offset="2312984">Well, Mr. Allshouse, as I recall from reading the briefs, there was some testimony excluded by the trial court that according to the plaintiffs and the court below would have been testimony on the purpose and effect of the restraints that were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.548" offset="2398143">And would that not go to the very question of any qualified immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="568.850" offset="2419355">No, Your Honor, we believe it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.919" offset="2427609">As to the question of restraints, the offered expert testimony would have said that restraints were used for the convenience for the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.742" offset="2466898">That, I submit, is not the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.344" offset="2473272">Restraints, even if that testimony were admitted, restraints could be used for the convenience of staff and still used for the protection of Mr. Romeo and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.186" offset="2528651">Indeed, the record in this case establishes that restraints were used for the protection of Mr. Romeo and especially protection of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.713" offset="2594793">I would respectfully disagree in the sense that the testimony as to whether or not restraints were used for convenience of the staff does not go to the constitutional issue; and that is, whether there was a legitimate state interest for use of restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.075" offset="2656233">The record reflected in this case that restraints were used in the hospital ward and were used only when prescribed by a physician, none of the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.446" offset="2697716">Moreover, the restraints were used because Mr. Romeo was in close proximity to other patients, some of whom had intravenous tubes attached, some of whom were in traction.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.588" offset="2746303">And given his aggressive behavior, he posed a danger to these individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2256.072" offset="9168246">We reject the concept, and we believe the facts of this case can show that it's impossible in all cases to provide decent care without providing some habilitation.</text>
