            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="131898">We will hear arguments first this morning in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District against Amy Rowley, by her parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.591" offset="186233">Mr. Kuntz, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="raymond_g_kuntz" startTime="17.476" stopTime="338.653">
            <label>Mr. Raymond G. Kuntz</label>
            <text syncTime="17.476" offset="201802">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.829" offset="215176">The principal issue before the Court this morning is: Did the Hendrick Hudson Central School District meet the requirements of Public Law 94-142, the Education of All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, when it provided Amy Rowley with an educational program which resulted in outstanding academic achievement and social success, although it did not comply with her parents' wishes that a sign language interpreter be placed in her classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.968" offset="347669">In one respect the case that's before you is an age old problem that confronts every public school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.256" offset="384868">It's not unusual in the course of any child's education that the parents disagree with the program prescribed or dictated by the local school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.583" offset="442128">And the question before you then becomes, how does this Act handle a disagreement with a program or a placement developed by a local school district by the parents when the parents are the parents of a handicapped child.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.126" offset="504300">According to the Respondent's position in this case, if they are able to persuade a court that they have a rational basis for the program that they advocate... that it's a slightly better program, if it results in somewhat improved performance... it's their claim that the Act allows them to go to court and to have the court dictate to the local educational institution that better program.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.081" offset="632195">Now, this is not a case where no services were provided to Amy Rowley.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.068" offset="656123">As a matter of fact, extraordinary care was taken to ensure benefit from the placement that was developed for her by the local school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.191" offset="692590">Before Amy Rowley enrolled in the Hendrick Hudson School District, plans were made for her arrival in this particular school.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.728" offset="726758">The school district has several elementary schools and in this particular elementary school this was the first time that this elementary school was to educate a deaf child.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.186" offset="772629">And the first determination made by the school district prior to the entry of Amy into the classroom was that she would not be sent to a school for the deaf, but that the school would make an effort, an attempt to educate her in a regular classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.480" offset="841802">Now, having made that determination, the school then prepared to receive her.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.784" offset="858938">The teachers in the school took a sign language course, because they knew that Amy was somewhat familiar with sign language and they wanted to be able to communicate with Amy.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.807" offset="899062">They did not know Amy, but they wanted to do everything that they thought they could to prepare themselves for her arrival at the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.230" offset="928737">The school district purchased a teletype machine which they installed in the office of the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.983" offset="955800">Amy's parents are both deaf, they have a teletype machine, and consequently the school and the parents can communicate visually by means of the teletype machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.422" offset="993521">The school then went a little bit further.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.624" offset="1006373">They hand picked Amy's teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.259" offset="1016927">They gave her a teacher that they thought would be responsive to the problems provided by a deaf child.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.497" offset="1041795">They put her in a small classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.499" offset="1049841">They made that classroom visually oriented, so that instead of ringing bells they flashed lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.369" offset="1081292">They seated Amy... they gave her a preferential seating so that she was in a position to see everything that went on; in other words, to make use of her natural facilities to enable her to understand what was going on in that classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.082" offset="1156211">Then they agreed with the parents that an experimental program would be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.986" offset="1179826">That is, during the first year, the kindergarten year, would be a time of trial where various methods would be experimented with to see what was appropriate for Amy.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.161" offset="1232489">The first thing they did was to do nothing, so that they could have some base data upon which to compare the results of the other experiments.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.749" offset="1262791">Then they tried a variety of hearing aids to see what kind of hearing, supplemental electronic hearing, worked best.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.803" offset="1291108">They tested Amy.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.189" offset="1300616">They had her hearing tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.957" offset="1311692">They discovered that she had significant residual hearings in the lower frequencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.278" offset="1333008">That means that the vowel sounds are audible to Amy, and that when her hearing is electronically supplemented she can understand a good portion of what's spoken to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.253" offset="1380865">They tried a sign language interpreter in her kindergarten classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.388" offset="1397374">They put the sign language interpreter in for a two week trial period to see what effect this would have upon the educational program.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.376" offset="1425377">At the conclusion of the two week period everybody who participated in that experiment, including the sign language interpreter, determined that it was not a useful service for Amy and as a matter of fact it might be a distraction for Amy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond G. Kuntz</label>
            <text syncTime="345.407" offset="1513462">A full classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.159" offset="1520463">There was also a constant monitoring of her program, not only by her teachers but by the school principal, who visited her classroom almost daily to make sure that her educational program was progressing satisfactorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.787" offset="1590994">Now, the results of this program were quite satisfactory to the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.041" offset="1620042">When Amy entered the first grade there was a determination made by the committee on the handicapped, and it's that determination which is ultimately before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.499" offset="1661838">She was classified as a handicapped child and she was classified as severely deaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.853" offset="1691304">The committee on the handicapped conducted an investigation of what was an appropriate placement for Amy in first grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.044" offset="1732055">They visited other classrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.913" offset="1743549">They sent one of their members to see Amy in her first grade classroom setting and to see how she was doing there with the services that had been provided in kindergarten.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.051" offset="1788061">The committee on the handicapped dispatched several of its members to visit other classrooms in other school districts, to visit a school for the deaf, to visit a board of cooperative educational classroom where deaf children were taught as a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.611" offset="1838321">They consulted experts on the education of the deaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.246" offset="1852845">They read articles and gathered professional materials and expert opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.248" offset="1872802">At the conclusion of that process they came back in early October and determined that what they would do for Amy was to place her in a regular... to allow her to remain placed in a regular first grade classroom, to supplement her hearing with an FM wireless system which amplifies the sound spoken into the sending unit, thereby blocking out all other sounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.901" offset="1987428">The receiving units pick up only what's sent; consequently, it doesn't amplify everything and background noise is thereby eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.023" offset="2023895">It decided that what they would do is give her the services of a speech therapist three times a week; that she would receive the services of a certified teacher of the deaf an hour a day, who would serve as a tutor for Amy during the regular school day.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.136" offset="2100381">She was again placed in a small classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.936" offset="2107591">It was again very visually oriented.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.855" offset="2115219">Her teacher was again hand picked so that the teacher would be responsive to Amy's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.259" offset="2136848">Now, the result of this placement was outstanding academic and social success for Amy.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.680" offset="2162553">She went into the first grade as a non reader, a typical thing for a child entering the first grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.686" offset="2194631">When she left the first grade she was a reader.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.038" offset="2204035">She had high standardized test scores developed for non deaf norms.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.942" offset="2227650">She had an equivalent class rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.894" offset="2239457">In other words, Amy placed in her class exactly as you would expect her to place, given her IQ, in terms of how that IQ compared with everybody else in that particular class.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.968" offset="2291702">She had excellent peer relationships and she had excellent rapport with her teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.371" offset="2313331">This program shows on the part of the Hendrick Hudson School District a deep caring for Amy Rowley.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.727" offset="2350739">The school district believes that it has an objective view as to what is the best program for Amy.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.231" offset="2376757">It believes that the sign language interpreter is a disservice.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.785" offset="2394938">The school district has built bridges of meaning to Amy, and the court dismantled those bridges and substituted a different program based upon what we contend is an inaccurate view of the purpose of the Act and its requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.045" offset="2456065">It's our contention that the Act is a funding statute and that as a funding statute the provision of free appropriate public education is a goal; that it requires no specific services; that the Act could have described specific services and it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.190" offset="2528580">We believe that education is a state matter and that the provision of services and the determination of the content of the education is left to the states under the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.175" offset="2676538">Our review of the progress of Amy indicates that she has continued as one would expect her to continue, that she's made the same progress with the sign language interpreter that she made without the sign language interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.301" offset="2729096">We see no significant difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.984" offset="2735784">While she has made some increase in her spelling skills, her mathematics skills declined somewhat, but not precipitously in either case and we find that her progress has continued on the same upward satisfactory level that it did prior to the time that the sign language interpreter was placed in her classroom.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael A. Chatoff</label>
            <text syncTime="1640.888" offset="6695425">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.616" offset="6766269">The primary issue in this case is this: Has a school district that receives funds under the Education of the Handicapped Act upon, its commitment to provide each handicapped child with a free appropriate public education fulfilled that obligation when it fails to provide a specific deaf child with the services necessary for that child to receive an educational opportunity equivalent to the educational opportunity provided to other children?</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.391" offset="6917361">The Respondents in this case are Amy Rowley, who is deaf... she is now ten years old and in fourth grade... and her parents Clifford and Nancy Rowley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.400" offset="6977442">This is not your typical everyday family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.121" offset="6996355">Clifford and Nancy Rowley are deaf, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.573" offset="7010148">Upon learning of Amy's deafness, they began training Amy in the use of total communication, the mode of communication used in their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.631" offset="7062393">Total communication is a flexible mode of communication using lip reading, amplification of residual hearing, if any, sign language, finger spelling, and visual cues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.061" offset="7140133">The lower court found that relying upon lip reading and amplification only Amy does not have access to more than two thirds of all communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.935" offset="7187571">The lower court found that relying upon total communication Amy has access to 100 percent of all communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.845" offset="7243265">Therefore, the lower court found that a program relying upon lip reading and amplification only would not be appropriate for Amy Rowley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.336" offset="7293211">Recipients of funds under the Education of the Handicapped Act commit themselves to provide each handicapped child within its borders with a free appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.996" offset="7347859">A free appropriate public education is specially designed instruction to meet the handicapped child's unique needs in order to provide that child with an equal educational opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.039" offset="7412016">The Petitioners and their amicus concede that the goal of the Act is to provide handicapped children with equal educational opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.810" offset="7451095">Among the factors to be considered in determining what is a free appropriate public education for each child is the extent of that child's disability and that child's upbringing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.687" offset="7514625">Amy's unique needs are obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.906" offset="7527477">The shortfall in her comprehension is precisely the deficiency Congress had in mind when it directed recipients to provide for the unique needs of each handicapped child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.018" offset="7595918">Amy needs a visual depiction of oral communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.087" offset="7620159">She can't learn if she can't understand, and she can't understand if material is presented to her in a mode of communication that's closed to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.962" offset="7663731">An interpreter merely provides Amy with access to the same education as available to every other student, no more and no less.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.068" offset="7812107">The trial court found that the school district said that providing an interpreter would be a distraction to Amy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.642" offset="7862367">However, relying upon expert evidence and written statements in the record, the trial court determined that an interpreter would not be a distraction for Amy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.669" offset="7926523">Amy is not special because she's deaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.691" offset="7958602">Any has special needs resulting from her deafness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.959" offset="7975634">It is those special needs that Congress directed recipients to accommodate in order to fulfil its obligations under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.601" offset="8014295">If Amy is special... and even the witnesses for the Petitioners concede that she is... she is special because of her intelligence and her creativity and her enthusiasm and her rapport with others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.527" offset="8077929">I don't believe anyone would question the fact that there have been past deficiencies in the education of deaf children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.734" offset="8122755">But that's all water under the bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.520" offset="8133936">We can't correct past deficiencies by providing Amy with anything on a silver platter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.392" offset="8169462">This is a tough world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.926" offset="8175522">It's going to be as tough for Amy as it will be for every other child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.380" offset="8193390">She'll have no preparation for that world if things are handed to her in a silver lining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.469" offset="8225678">But if she is going to compete in this world, she must receive an education equivalent to other children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.573" offset="8258174">This court said that education is the principal instrument for preparing the child for later professional training and helping that child to adjust normally to its environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.184" offset="8324629">Once Amy gets an education, an equivalent education, what she does with that education is up to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.390" offset="8365380">The school district has no obligation to guarantee her any particular level of achievement, only the same opportunity to achieve as everyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.098" offset="8408221">The purpose of the Act is to accommodate the unique needs of each handicapped child so that the deficiencies of the past do not reoccur in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.067" offset="9560117">In my portion of the argument I would like to address several of Petitioner's contentions that raise fundamental questions about the purpose and intent of Congress in enacting the Education of the Handicapped Act in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.543" offset="9614034">Relying on this Court's recent decision last term in Pennhurst, Petitioners argue that the Act does not entitle individual handicapped children and their parents to claim a substantive right to a free appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.303" offset="9673070">They also contend that the judicial review provisions of the Act limit review to matters of procedure and do not permit a handicapped child and his or her parents to challenge determinations of state and local school authorities concerning particular services that are to be given to an individual child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.216" offset="9756662">Instead, Petitioners assert that the Act merely requires that the services provided to a child conform to the state plan prepared by the state commissioner of education pursuant to the Act, and that if the individual program complies with the plan there is no further recourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.847" offset="9859271">These claims are completely contrary to the Congressional intent as reflected in the language and history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.639" offset="9898350">Unlike the state at issue in Pennhurst, the Education of the Handicapped Act requires as a condition for receipt of federal funds that each recipient state have in effect a policy that assures all handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.551" offset="9974001">The Act also requires the states, as a condition of receiving funds, to develop a plan setting forth in detail the procedures and policies that it intends to provide in order to assure that a free appropriate public education will be available to all handicapped children within the state within certain periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.999" offset="10071803">The Act also requires as a condition of receiving funds that the states establish procedures to assure that to the maximum extent appropriate handicapped children receive supplemental aids and services to allow them to be educated together with non handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.711" offset="10142647">The legislative history confirms that Congress meant to establish a statutory right of individual handicapped children to a free appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.582" offset="10182145">For example--</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.615" offset="10282350">The Court of Appeals, however, did not rely on that part of the District Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.933" offset="10303562">On page A-6 of the appendix to the petition, the Court of Appeals quoted that part of the District Court's opinion that stated that under the Act the educational authorities involved in this case are required to bring Amy's educational opportunity up to a level of educational opportunity being offered to her non handicapped peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.936" offset="10415575">In other words, the emphasis is not on potential or shortfall from potential, but on the making available to handicapped children the same opportunities that are available to non handicapped children to benefit from the regular educational program that the state or local school authorities provide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.832" offset="14151189">In answer to two questions raised by Justice Stevens, the Government's brief states that... I think you have the figures correctly... around $27,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.306" offset="14201031">Consequently, the cost is about $160 per handicapped child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.794" offset="14222974">That does comport with the national average, which is between $150 to $200.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.530" offset="14245962">And the State of New York received $45 million for approximately 200,000 children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.215" offset="14268740">So consequently the statistics show that a significant portion of that burden is not borne by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.438" offset="14297580">The records also show, developed by Congress through the reports submitted to Congress and required by Congress and submitted by the Secretary, that the percentage of funding is on a decreasing level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.046" offset="14355989">It's now down to, in this last fiscal year, approximately eight percent of the cost of educating the average child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.634" offset="14390367">I also wanted to deal just for a moment, too, with your question before to counsel for the Respondents about whether the decision requires every child to have a sign language interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.225" offset="14436760">The court made, in our view, an unwarranted leap from an audiological test conducted in isolation in a laboratory setting, which found that Amy only could hear 59 percent... it was a word discrimination test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.656" offset="14510425">The court leapt from that fact to a conclusion which we believe is unwarranted, that is that Amy understands only 59 percent of what transpires in her class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.463" offset="14557655">We say that the unrebutted evidence is that she understands nearly all of what transpires in her class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.467" offset="14585762">Now, the court was able to reach the decision it did by adopting the philosophical approach of the Respondents in this case, and that approach was that every deaf child does better with a sign language interpreter in their class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.329" offset="14653158">Amy is deaf, consequently she does better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.712" offset="14662667">They adopted that syllogism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.047" offset="14667996">The rationale for that syllogism was presented by the Respondents' experts at the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.785" offset="14690984">As a matter of fact, when the case was tried before the independent hearing officer the Respondents' case consisted of three witnesses and a total of about 13 pages of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.573" offset="14734138">Those witnesses established these facts: Amy is deaf, Amy's parents were deaf, Amy's parents wanted a sign language interpreter in her and class, and written evidence... that is, expert opinion... was to the effect that a sign language interpreter was required for every deaf child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.570" offset="14814177">The parents introduced no evidence whatsoever at either the trial before the independent hearing officer or at the trial before the District Court as to how Amy was doing in class, because in their view that consideration was irrelevant because of the philosophical premise adopted by the particular theory of deaf education promulgated by the experts brought to testify on Amy's behalf, none of whom had ever seen Amy in the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.156" offset="14928489">And to the contrary, all of the experts testifying on the district's behalf, all had observed Amy in the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.329" offset="14961194">And we refer you to the joint appendix, where we have put the testimony by one of the witnesses at the independent hearing and one of the witnesses before the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.837" offset="15015216">And we think that that's moving and convincing testimony that Amy understands nearly all of what transpires in her classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.490" offset="15041756">Thank you very much.</text>
