            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We will hear arguments first this morning in Valley Forge Christian College against the Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.056" offset="44199">Mr. Hodgson, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Clark Hodgson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.008" offset="56007">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, my client's petition to this Court raises for review the question of whether or not taxpayers who are unable to meet the criteria of Flast against Cohen and any other Article III decision of this Court will nonetheless be able to challenge the transfer of federal surplus property.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.156" offset="160601">This, in short, is an Article III case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.358" offset="173349">It is not an establishment clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.643" offset="182544">The constitutional and statutory context is outlined by Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the Constitution, which is called the property clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.118" offset="228415">Under that clause Congress has the power to dispose of territory or other property belonging to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.441" offset="257672">The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 was enacted pursuant to that power, and creates a comprehensive program for federal property disposal, particularly property which is surplus, that is, property no longer needed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.685" offset="334681">The statute confers upon agencies of the executive branch a variety of options for property disposal, including the sale or lease to health or educational institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.460" offset="377835">Sale may be for cash, but the Act requires that the Secretary consider any public benefit accruing to the United States as a result of the sale, and an educational institution may be entitled to a reduction in the purchase price computed on the basis of benefits which may accrue to the United States for the use of the property by that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.239" offset="468950">The regulations refer to that reduction as a public benefit allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.377" offset="489430">Now, for the first time in the 32-year history of this Act, a program over which Congress has given exclusive if not plenary power under Article IV is subject to attack and the intervention of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.153" offset="552542">This particular transfer, the Valley Forge General Hospital, originally about a 181 acre tract slightly outside the city of Philadelphia, was acquired by the government in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.080" offset="612310">It served the military as a hospital facility for nearly 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.733" offset="634880">In 1974, by order of the Secretary of Defense, the facility was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.656" offset="662570">The Secretary states reasons of declining work force and economy as the reasons for the closure of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.910" offset="691618">As is required by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, the following four steps took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.066" offset="720248">First, the military departments determined that it was excess to their needs and the needs of the United States Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.153" offset="748565">Secondly, Congressional clearance was sought and obtained from the Armed Services Committee of both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.374" offset="769463">Thirdly, the General Services Administration, after notifying all other Federal agencies and all other branches of the government of the availability of this facility, reported that there was no need, and it was declared under the statute surplus to the needs of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.733" offset="834873">Finally, it was assigned to the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for disposition to a health or educational institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.607" offset="874371">My client, Valley Forge Christian College, applied for a portion of the tract, and was ultimately selected to receive 77 acres and some personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.449" offset="929750">The value of the surplus facility was $577,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.437" offset="957649">The government, in connection with this sale, allowed a 100 percent public benefit allowance based in part upon my client's promises and representations to continue the broadening of its offerings in the arts and humanities and otherwise strengthen its academic position, conferring benefits upon members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.301" offset="1049182">In August of 1976, a deed was executed by the government transferring the real estate to my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.326" offset="1089202">The deed included restrictive covenants which forbid the college from utilizing the property for anything other than educational purposes and some other restrictions, and included in the government the right at any time within 30 years to revert the title back to the Department in the event of a breach of these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.076" offset="1196304">In the fall of 1976, as a result of a news release that was issued following this transfer, Americans United, the organization, and four paid employees on its executive staff filed a lawsuit in the district court seeking a recision of the transaction, thereby effectively ousting my client from its college campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.743" offset="1306958">After limited pretrial discovery, the district court dismissed the complaint, finding that none of the plaintiffs could comply with the standing criteria of Flast against Cohen, and further holding that their complaint alleged no more than a generalized grievance about the conduct of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.256" offset="1392953">The United States Court of Appeals unanimously agreed with the lower court's finding that these taxpayers could not meet the Flast criteria, but nevertheless reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.664" offset="1446557">The majority opinion of the Third Circuit launched an unsupportable test for establishment clause standing, wherein standing is now to be predicated upon the violation of the shared, individuated right that each citizen has to a government that obeys its Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.185" offset="1572676">The Third Circuit spent most of its time on Flast against Cohen and tried to steer its reasoning around Flast.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.574" offset="1610292">I think it finally concluded that under Flast, or this Court was bound by limitations on the pleadings when it decided Flast.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.263" offset="1648953">Had the fact situation been presented to this Court that was before the Third Circuit, namely the presence of citizen separationists, the Flast Court would have decided that differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.821" offset="1691272">That was the general approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.932" offset="1759713">I agree that the words of the opinion appear limited to the establishment clause, but I think that the potential reach of this decision, the implication of a personal right in every citizen to enforce the Constitution at his or her demand is limitless.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.911" offset="2139638">The law of this country on standing until the radical reconstruction of this standing test by the Third Circuit related to the finding of a personal stake or injury in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.422" offset="2205675">That has been the construction of Article III by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.641" offset="2218527">As to taxpayer standing, Flast has been the first and, until that opinion, the last word.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.311" offset="2249143">As Your Honors will recall, Flast allowed a taxpayer to challenge on establishment clause grounds a Congressional exercise of the taxing and spending power of the Constitution, the Article I, Section 8 powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.107" offset="2320405">It was specifically limited by the text of the opinion to those circumstances and to that type of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.879" offset="2351438">This Court has strongly and consistently resisted any effort to expand Flast on taxpayer basis beyond Article I, Section 8, the taxing and spending power.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.120" offset="2404415">Specifically, in Schlesinger, this Court rejected a taxpayer's challenge that was brought pursuant to the incompatibility clause under Article I.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.394" offset="2445479">The same could be said of Richardson wherein executive action was challenged by a taxpayer pursuant to Article I, Section 9, Clause 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.100" offset="2484349">Here, of course, these taxpayers seek still a further run around Flast and say that the property clause, Article IV, and Congressional action taken pursuant to that clause should become the basis for standing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="1139.117" offset="4556382">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I agree with Mr. Hodgson that there probably are other plaintiffs who could bring the suit in this case, but it is correct, as he also pointed out, that this Court in Schlesinger said that the lack of a better plaintiff does not mean that this plaintiff has standing, and indeed it is worthy of note that in the companion case, United States versus Richardson, this Court went one step further, and said that the fact that there is not a plaintiff who has standing in the traditional Article III sense is a good indication that it is the kind of case that ought to be left to the political branches of government rather than to the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.396" offset="4729522">It is quite clear that since these plaintiffs allege a harm that cannot be differentiated from the hundreds of millions of other American citizens, and since they do not fit the Flast versus Cohen standards for taxpayer standing, the only way that the judgment of the Court of Appeals can be sustained is to uphold the rationale of that court, which was that the establishment clause creates in each citizen a personal constitutional right to a government that does not establish religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.702" offset="4866717">There are two basic theories on the basis of which that could be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.088" offset="4884271">One is the one that Mr. Hodgson suggested, which is that any citizen has a right to enforce any provision of the Constitution, and frankly, it would be difficult if the right were limited to the establishment clause to distinguish it from many other provisions of the Constitution, but the approach of the Court of Appeals appears to have been to limit it to establishment clause to distinguish it from many other provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.002" offset="4963997">But the approach of the Court of Appeals appears to have been to limit it to establishment clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.220" offset="4980820">As I say, it has been difficult to do that, but that appears to have been the approach of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.875" offset="5007464">We would urge that even that approach represents neither good law nor good constitutional policy for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.081" offset="5048320">One is that it would violate this Court's consistent teaching which gives more deference to the judicial article of the Constitution, Article III, that the fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the party seeking to get its complaint before a federal court, and not on the issues that he wishes to have adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.012" offset="5132016">More specifically, requiring the precise overruling of Doremus versus Board of Education, which was an establishment clause case brought by a citizen and dismissed because of the fact that there was no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.438" offset="5189695">Doremus has been cited with approval both in Flast and also Schlesinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.758" offset="5214981">Perhaps most important of all, the rulings of this Court requiring first that the plaintiff be affected more narrowly than members of the total populace, and second, that standing focused on the plaintiff rather than on the nature of the claim that the plaintiff is bringing lies right at the heart of basic constitutional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.539" offset="5310067">The feature of our constitutional system that distinguishes courts from the other two branches of government is that courts perform their law interpretive function, including declarations of constitutionality, only in cases or controversies and interest of the kind that these plaintiffs are pressing in this case, an interest in seeing that a particular philosophy of government prevailed, can be carried to the elected branches, and those branches are free to entertain it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.555" offset="5834188">Under Doremus, both would have come out the same way, and you really are at a Flast kind of crossroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.309" offset="5857176">You either maintain that holding that is not entirely principled but at least practical and workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.164" offset="5892598">A principle which this Court has cautioned on at least two occasions represented only a slight departure from Frothingham versus Mellon, or if you say that there is no practical distinction, economic distinction between a conveyance of money on the one hand and a conveyance of property on the other hand, then you can forget about Flast versus Cohen, you can forget about the taxpayer standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.646" offset="5994580">You don't need it any more, because if citizens have standing, then any property owner also or any taxpayer will also have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.921" offset="6035644">And that really brings me to the fundamental reason that that would be a bad idea, to decide the case that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.024" offset="6068036">In contrast to the political branches of government, which are perfectly free under the Constitution to entertain any advocacy for a particular form of government, philosophy of government that is put to them, the tradition ever since Marbury versus Madison has been that courts decide only those issues as they arise in actual lawsuits brought by persons who are injured in fact, and on at least seven separate occasions, reaching all the way back to the early parts of this century, this Court has said that that injury in fact means an injury more specific than the effect that is felt by the populace as a whole, and in our separation of powers, check and balance constitutional system, the most effective check on judicial power is the case or controversy limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.409" offset="6281613">The Court of Appeals suggested two possible bases for distinguishing this case or for distinguishing establishment clause cases from other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.938" offset="6347651">One was that the establishment clause does have or is a guarantor of individual liberties, and it is true beyond doubt that it can be, but far from being an argument in support of the Court of Appeals decision, it is squarely against it for this reason, that in those instances where you do have that kind of individualized harm, then that gives you a plaintiff with traditional Article III standing, and where you don't have it, then what you have is, as this Court said in Richardson, the kind of case that by definition ought to be handled by the Article III... ought to be handled by the Article I or the Article II branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.752" offset="6535001">The second proposition that was set forth by Judge Rosen, whose vote was essential to the majority in the Court of Appeals decision, was this matter that has already been discussed, is there a better plaintiff, and this Court made it very clear in both Richardson and Schlesinger that that is not a relevant concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.617" offset="6626429">To the extent it is relevant, it cuts the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.652" offset="6642521">Finally, setting aside establishment clause cases as being something of a special nature... would give... would unduly degrade the judicial article of the Constitution, which should have an independent life of its own, because to the already complex and difficult issues that surround standing, we would be visiting another layer of complexity, a layer of complexity that would incorporate into the Article III inquiry the question of what is an establishment of religion, presumably including the three-part test that this Court has struggled so mightily with over the past decade.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.426" offset="7737678">Something like that was proposed with the Council of Revision, which was expressly rejected by the Constitutional Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.017" offset="7795984">The underlying premise of Marbury versus Madison, the reason for judicial review is that judicial review is necessary to the performance by the Article III branch of its function of deciding real lawsuits between real parties, and this Court clarified a half-century ago in Chicago Grand Trunk Railway versus Wellman that the corollary to that Marbury versus Madison principle is also true, that courts perform that function only in those circumstances where it is necessary in order to perform their Article III case or controversy decisional process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.849" offset="7987304">Perhaps the most revealing statement on the record in this case is that of the plaintiff Setumbrini, who said, I represent all American citizens, and indeed he does.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.234" offset="8312895">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I believe that this is the first opportunity which this Court has had to address the question of standing as it impacts on the establishment clause since the landmark decision which had been discussed here of Flast versus Cohen some 13 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.782" offset="8415086">This case also presents the first establishment challenge to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act which the Court of Appeals has suggested in this particular case that there is the probability that no one... that if these plaintiffs do not have standing, no one perhaps has standing to challenge, and I would suggest that if the Court should find that there is no standing, that that particular Act, that particular Act of Congress would be immune from the establishment clause challenge, no matter how gross the violation might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.859" offset="8579344">Wasn't it said either in Reservists or Schlesinger that the fact that there is no one who has standing does not confer standing on someone?</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.590" offset="8658338">However, I think in that particular case the suggestion of then Solicitor General Robert Bork as he argued that case before this Court is instructive, because he in that particular case argued that the plaintiff interest in CIA funding hardly rose to the dignity of a constitutional right involved in Flast because, as he said, First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, and there is a broader concept of standing appropriate in that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.930" offset="8799713">That was the argument that was made in Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.948" offset="8807758">In the brief in Richardson, the Solicitor General argued that the case did not involve core values involved in Flast; it involved the statement and account provision not central to the Constitution, and thus the circumstances rendered doubtful the occurrence of substantial adverse interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2310.934" offset="9243690">I think that the establishment clause is different from even any other First Amendment right for this reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.805" offset="9371167">That is not true necessarily with the establishment clause, because basically that right is a right to be free from certain governmental actions, and may not directly impact specifically uniquely on any particular person, and I think that presents a separate, specific problem that must be addressed in a practical way.</text>

            <text syncTime="4306.194" offset="17224725">In Warth versus Seldin, it was stated that the standing question requires a determination as to whether the constitutional or statutory provisions on which a claim rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiff's position judicial relief, and I would suggest that the establishment clause does do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.445" offset="17333708">It grants to a specific individual the right to judicial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.415" offset="17353561">I question whether it is ever tolerable to expect the establishment clause by the doctrine of standing to be divided into enforceable and non-enforceable establishment clause rights, and I suggest also that the precious aspects of religious freedom should never be placed upon the barter block of legislative debate, political trade-offs or compromise.</text>
