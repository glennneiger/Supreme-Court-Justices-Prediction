            <text syncTime="100.699" offset="534067">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="102.282" offset="540441">This case involves an award of attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, a federal statute which authorizes fees as a part of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.939" offset="599059">There is no issue here about whether the petitioner, the plaintiff below, was the prevailing party, or whether there was an entitlement to fees under the Fees Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.813" offset="638556">The issues here instead are procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.682" offset="650050">The first issue concerns the timing of a request for attorney's fees under the Fees Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.253" offset="676277">The second issue concerns the ethical conflicts which arise from the imposition of a requirement that fees be negotiated simultaneously with the relief for the class on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.893" offset="726850">As to the timing of a fee request, there are at least three views about the proper characterization of fee requests, and hence, of the timing of a fee request.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.153" offset="779931">First, is the fee request part of the costs, as defined by Congress, as recognized by this Court in Hutto v Finney, and indeed, in Newman v Piggie Park Enterprises, and as recognized by the drafters of Rule 54(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="179.698" offset="850148">Second and quite consistently, is a request for fees a matter to be determined in an independent proceeding, supplemental to the original proceeding, and thus not a request for a modification of the original decree on the merits, as held by this Court in Sprague v Ticonic National Bank, and as recognized by this Court in Bradley v School Board of City of Richmond, and implicitly in Maher v Gagne, decided two years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.396" offset="1052859">Justice Rehnquist, generally it is a rule of reasonableness with regard to the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.633" offset="1077832">I mean, in the Federal Rules itself there is no specific time period with regard to the filing of a bill of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.870" offset="1106775">What happens within the trial courts, Your Honor, is that very often, the court will decide fees as part of the costs as well as other items of costs quite quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.012" offset="1151392">On other occasions, when appeals, are taken, the bill of costs issues, with regard to all items of costs, are sometimes reserved pending the outcome of the appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.930" offset="1379076">Even if the time for appeal of the underlying order had elapsed, costs are still determined thereafter.</text>

            <label>Mr. B. Richard Larson</label>
            <text syncTime="322.988" offset="1423275">Well, we do think... there are several time limits that could be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.357" offset="1440725">The basic time limit that is applied by trial courts, Justice O'Connor, is the rule of reasonableness with regard to, for example, if there are ongoing fee negotiations; that the trial courts will not allow a request for costs or a request for fees as part of the costs to be made an extraordinary amount of time, especially when there are no ongoing negotiations.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.205" offset="1536124">Secondly, if I may with regard to Justice O'Connor's question, some district courts do have time limits with regard to the filings of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.678" offset="1574054">Usually they are around 30 days, sometimes more.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.361" offset="1584712">But there is a major distinction between these trial court rules on the filing of costs and Rule 59(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="370.117" offset="1611774">Local court rules are extendable by the courts, and we have to give some consideration to district courts to manage their own dockets with regard to case management.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.723" offset="1654197">Rule 59(e), though, the ten-day period there, under Rule 6(b), is not extendable.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.560" offset="1677603">It is not a rule that can be enlarged under the Federal Rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.832" offset="4762664">It is also consistent with your decision for this unanimous Court in Bradley v School Board of City of Richmond, where the Court recognized that simultaneous... even apart from the ethical issue... that it is undesirable for a court to engage in simultaneous resolution of the fees and of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.846" offset="4842703">That instead, the fee issue should be dealt with in a separate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.298" offset="4860467">Section 59(e), briefly, we did point out in our brief that 59(e) was designed to handle a situation wholly apart from the consideration of a new evidentiary matter such as fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.480" offset="4945208">Rule 59(e) was designed to care for a situation as provided by the eighth circuit in the Boaz case, for a court, a trial court, to correct a judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.595" offset="5049698">59(e) is basically for correction of an error of law, and it was not designed to cover situations such as the filing of fee requests, which sometimes are extraordinarily long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.938" offset="5103092">With regard to the collateral and the independent proceeding that is normally held in trial courts, I would like to point out that this is entirely consistent with not only what happened in this Court's decision in Maher v. Gagne where, as in this case, there was a consent decree that did not mention fees, and this Court went on and considered and held that consistent with the legislative history of the Fees Act that a prevailing plaintiff can become a prevailing plaintiff through a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.211" offset="5244153">Now, in the legislative history, in both the Senate report and in the House report, the Congress recognizes that fees flow from the judgment, and that as a result of a consent decree, a plaintiff thereafter can be determined to be, in an independent proceeding, a prevailing party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.401" offset="7792868">Nothing specifically, Justice O'Connor, but there is language I believe in the Senate report that indicates that in passing the Act, the Congress intended to bring the remedy under 1983 actions in line with the remedies that were available under other civil rights actions, and the language of the Senate report also indicated that it did not intend to create any startling new remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.187" offset="7916062">I would suggest that if you were to construe a free as a cost, and thereby allow the fee award to be asserted adversely any time after entry of final judgment, that would indeed be a startling new remedy that the Congress did not intend to create when it enacted the Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marc R. Scheer</label>
            <text syncTime="1996.687" offset="8118041">Correct, but there are basically two bases for our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.506" offset="8133296">One is that indeed, fees are substantially different from costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.125" offset="8147820">And Congress, by using the language it did in the statute, did not intend to define fees as costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.231" offset="8180212">You must look at the entire language of the statutory at the discretionary aspect of the court award of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.200" offset="8200065">The other basis of our argument is that a fee award, under 42 USC 1988, is intimately tied to the merits of the underlying cause of action; that it is not a collateral and independent matter, as suggested by the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.412" offset="8272999">In support of that contention, he cites certain cases that deal with what is known as the common fund doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.500" offset="8301316">In those cases, courts have held that when a common fund is identified, the prevailing plaintiff, the successful plaintiff, can receive an attorney's fee award out of the common fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.527" offset="8365368">Those cases, however, do not bear on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.747" offset="8382295">In the common fund cases, once the fund is identified, the losing party no longer has any interest in the award of attorney's fees out of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.770" offset="8418344">The award of those fees is intended to spread, to distribute the fees among the class of benefited, by the efforts of the successful party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.709" offset="8458155">In this case, quite to the contrary, you have a situation where the attorney's fee award is directly against the losing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.231" offset="8492219">He obviously has a direct compelling interest in the amount of the fee award because he is going to have to pay it out of his own pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.920" offset="8523043">So those essentially are our two main arguments with respect to why Rule 54(d) cannot be applied to this situation.</text>
