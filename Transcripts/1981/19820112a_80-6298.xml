            <text syncTime="12.117" offset="125815">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.998" offset="137413">The suit today is to determine whether the State of Texas can prohibit illegitimate children over the age of one year from seeking a determination of paternity and obtaining child support from their natural fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.054" offset="189554">This prohibition is found in Section 13.01 of the Texas Family Code, which is a one year statute of limitations, stated simply a suit to establish the parent-child relationship cannot be filed after the child turns one year old if the child is illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.343" offset="270742">Now, what Texas has done is to establish two limitations periods, one of one year for illegitimate children and one of 18 years for legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.191" offset="318180">There is no limitation at all for legitimate children or children born during a marriage, they can file for child support under Texas law at any time until they turn 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.672" offset="364052">Now, it is important to note and keep in mind that this is 13.01 is the only limitation period that applies for any interest that a child may have in the State of Texas for any other kind of lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.879" offset="424865">All other limitations involving an interest in children are tolled either by statute in Texas or by case law in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.410" offset="463003">Only 13.01 applies to an interest that a child might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.801" offset="484633">This suit was originally filed by the natural mother of the child, Lois Mae Mills, and the Department of Human Resources against the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.911" offset="520995">At the time the suit was filed, Archie Burton Duncan, the illegitimate child who is the subject of the suit was approximately 20 months old.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.087" offset="553700">The trial court dismissed the case citing 13.01 on the -- at that time respondent's motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.097" offset="581808">The Corpus Christi Court of Civil Appeals affirmed and did note that the Fourteenth Amendment allegations of the petitioner it -- at the Court of Civil Appeals was meritless.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.179" offset="630083">The Texas Supreme Court refused the writ of error and refused to hear the case on motion for rehearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.938" offset="913145">The only thing I can say is it was argued at some length or was briefed and argued at some length in the Texas Court of Civil Appeals and that's all the Court chose to say about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.263" offset="970406">Now, there has been one change or a major change in this law since this suit was filed and since it was determined in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.093" offset="1001753">The one year statute of limitations has been changed now under 13.01 to a four-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.645" offset="1027980">This went into effect on September 1st of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.156" offset="1046056">It doesn't affect this case in any way first because Texas has ruled that limitations are a substantial procedure and that once limitation is run, it becomes a vested right of the defendant to use it as a defense and secondly the child in this suit was over four years old on September 1st, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.072" offset="1129648">So even if it could have been used, the child here could not have used the four-year statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.675" offset="1408114">Those limitations have been tolled by common law that Texas Supreme Court has ruled that for instance in workers' compensation cases where a minor has a workers' compensation claim that the sixth month limitation there is tolled by public because of the past cases and by public policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.462" offset="1587209">But since there's no tolling provision, the difference between 4 years and 18 years, I still say all of the arguments are still the same and -- and really feel that there's no real difference since we have a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.536" offset="1651575">Texas can -- for children can make any kind of limitation period they want.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.425" offset="9451111">There are several cases which referred to not giving retroactivity to the one year statute which became effective in our state on September 1, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.465" offset="9503252">The reason to me is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.715" offset="9512238">That was a substantive right which was granted by the Texas legislature for the first time as an avenue for establishing paternity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.063" offset="9585589">It is a paternity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.404" offset="9594994">Now, it is true that it is a predicate and avenue for an illegitimate child to establish paternity where upon then it can establish support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.121" offset="9633864">It does many other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.715" offset="9644208">It gives that illegitimate child an opportunity to declare itself an heir at law for purposes of inheritance from an interstate biological father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.958" offset="9693214">It gives that illegitimate child an opportunity to qualify for social security benefits in the event of the death of the worker holding a social security account number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.441" offset="9731144">It likewise, gives that illegitimate child an opportunity to establish paternity for the purpose of becoming entitled to workers' compensation, to life insurance policies, and those kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.338" offset="9782762">Now, this avenue in Texas was not available to an illegitimate child until September 1, 1975.</text>
