            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="57.903" offset="370069">This case began in February 1976, when a Park Police officer stopped Respondent for speeding on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.894" offset="414060">The officer spotted a suspicious package under the armrest in Respondent's car and asked him to lift up the armrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.548" offset="440704">Instead, Respondent got into his car, placed it suddenly in gear, and roared off, knocking the officer onto the rear of Respondent's car and then onto the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.022" offset="482605">The officer recovered, got into his vehicle, and gave chase at high speeds, but was unable to apprehend Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.462" offset="516355">The officer thereupon filed a complaint in federal magistrate's court in Hyattsville, charging a number of petty and misdemeanor offenses, including a misdemeanor assault charge under Section 113(d) of Title 18 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.471" offset="576332">A warrant was issued for Respondent's arrest and he was apprehended several weeks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.773" offset="597544">He appeared at a preliminary hearing at which he was bound over for trial before the magistrate and released on bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.029" offset="626592">He failed to appear for the trial and he was not found until three years later, when the magistrate was advised that he was in jail in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.968" offset="662327">Arrangements were made to transport Respondent to Hyattsville, where the magistrate's court is located, and he appeared there on May 24th, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.407" offset="704123">On that day cases in the magistrate's court were being handled by an attorney from the Antitrust Division who was serving on a two-week detail in the magistrate's court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.048" offset="746651">She conferred briefly with the Park Police officer--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="154.500" offset="756473">Are there lots of antitrust cases out there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="156.452" stopTime="448.924">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="764309">--No, I think this is a training program for people who want a little court experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.356" offset="787924">She conferred briefly with the police officer who had filed the complaint and been the victim of the assault, and she also discussed with Respondent's counsel the possibility of a plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.664" offset="837139">However, Respondent indicated that he was not interested in a plea bargain and instead demanded a jury trial on the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.651" offset="865038">Since at the time the magistrate had no power to conduct jury trials, the case was perforce referred to the district court in Baltimore, where Assistant United States Attorney Norton was assigned to handle the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.625" offset="912998">As a result of Mr. Norton's reevaluation of the case in the course of his preparation for trial, the original charges were superseded in an indictment containing the felony charge of assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.920" offset="982171">It is the validity of that charge that is the subject of inquiry today.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.389" offset="1000038">In response to Respondent's motion to dismiss on vindictive prosecution grounds, the prosecutor filed an affidavit explaining his reasons for seeking the felony indictment, which were as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="227.714" offset="1049358">First, his assessment of the gravity of Respondent's conduct in connection with the commission of the offense itself;--</text>
            <text syncTime="234.385" offset="1076002">Second, Respondent's criminal record, which showed a lengthy prior history of violent crime;--</text>
            <text syncTime="240.087" offset="1098781">Third, his judgment that the assault on the Park Police officer was related to a major narcotics transaction;--</text>
            <text syncTime="246.526" offset="1124590">Fourth, his belief that Respondent had committed perjury at the preliminary hearing in 1976 when he testified that he had been in Atlanta and not on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway at the time of the incident;--</text>
            <text syncTime="258.251" offset="1171506">And finally, Respondent's flight to avoid trial on the initial charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.119" offset="1190941">The prosecutor further averred that his decision to seek the felony indictment was not motivated in any way by, nor did he ever consider, Respondent's request for a jury trial in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.795" offset="1241619">The district court denied the motion to dismiss the felony assault charge, finding that the prosecutor had adequately dispelled any appearance of retaliatory intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.901" offset="1282056">Respondent was sentenced to five years imprisonment on the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.603" offset="1296894">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.722" offset="1305358">The Court of Appeals concluded that the simple fact of the return of a more severe charge after the assertion of the right to a jury trial created an appearance of vindictiveness that establishes</text>
            <text syncTime="303.078" offset="1350811">"a per se violation of the due process clause, requiring dismissal of the new charges. "</text>
            <text syncTime="304.530" offset="1356558">It further held that the fatal appearance of vindictiveness could not be rebutted by any explanation of the prosecutor other than a showing that the increased charges could not have been brought in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.670" offset="1405145">Now, before turning to my argument I'd like to make a couple of preliminary observations about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.991" offset="1430432">The first is, I think the Court should appreciate the sweeping effect of the Fourth Circuit's rule, because the rule is really tantamount to saying that in all but a very small proportion of cases the initial charge that's brought by the prosecutor cannot be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.786" offset="1501589">All that's necessary to trigger the appearance of vindictiveness and the almost irrebuttable presumption of a due process violation under the Fourth Circuit's holding is the exercise of a right by the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.795" offset="1553625">And in a criminal case rights start being exercised fast and furious shortly after the initial filing of the initial charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.818" offset="1589779">And the kind of explanation that the Fourth Circuit would accept to rebut the appearance of vindictiveness and to show that there was no retaliatory motive is strictly limited to what would be an extremely small class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.411" offset="1652159">Now, the second point I wanted to make preliminarily is that the purpose of the vindictive prosecution due process prohibition is not to protect generally against unjustified charging decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.437" offset="1716211">The protection against abuse of the prosecutor's discretion generally in charging decisions is the grand jury and the trial and the judicial procedures incident thereto, as well as the political pressures and the supervision within the executive branch over the prosecutor's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.334" offset="1791758">The purpose of the vindictive prosecution doctrine is specifically to protect against a vindictive retaliation for the exercise of a right by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.273" offset="1835539">Now, here it's important to note that the Court of Appeals readily concluded, in their words, that there was no actual vindictiveness on the part of the prosecutor in this case, and Respondent has never alleged to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.901" offset="1898024">In fact, it's absolutely clear on the facts of this case that the jury demand was wholly irrelevant to the prosecutor's decision to increase the charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.984" offset="1998438">--That would depend on the nature of the claim of vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.687" offset="2025188">If we're talking about a situation like Bordenkircher, where there was a retaliation for the refusal to plead guilty as part of the plea bargaining process, there would be no occasion for further inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.042" offset="2154651">But I think it's an important part of our argument that the circumstances in which there might be a proper showing to require such an inquiry are quite limited.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="517.234" offset="2207418">Well, our argument with regard to the pretrial situation us essentially that there should be no presumption of vindictiveness, that what the Court of Appeals did here and what the courts of appeals have been doing in what we think is a misinterpretation of Pearce and Perry is to equate the mere exercise of a right followed by an increase in charges with a presumed vindictiveness on the part of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.552" offset="2324656">And we do not believe that has any place in the analysis of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.657" offset="2353077">I think we are not prepared to say, and we certainly don't need to for purposes of this case, to go as far as Judge Meritt went in the Andrews case and say that it's perfectly all right for the prosecutor to be vindictive in the pretrial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.381" offset="2403963">We're not urging that upon the Court in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.667" offset="2413158">You're not urging the application of a per se rule either way, in other words?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="574.237" stopTime="883.254">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="574.237" offset="2435415">We are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.004" offset="2442520">Let me just explain how I view the structure of the issues and perhaps our position will become clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.677" offset="2469165">It seems to me that every due process vindictiveness claim essentially presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.312" offset="2491735">The first part... the first question is whether the defendant who is making the claim has shown enough to make out a prime facie case of a due process violation and to shift to the prosecutor the burden of explaining his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.506" offset="2556518">Of course, if not enough has been shown, then that's the end of the matter and the motion should be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.660" offset="2577103">The second question, if enough has been shown to call for an explanation by the prosecutor, is what kinds of explanations should be deemed acceptable to rebut such a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.933" offset="2618167">Now, here the question is whether the Respondent, by simply showing that he demanded a jury trial and that at some time subsequent to that demand more severe charges were returned, did enough to make out a prima facie case of vindictive prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.994" offset="2690474">The Court of Appeals, importing the principles of Pearce and Perry to the pretrial context, has held that those facts suffice to create a presumption if vindictiveness, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.087" offset="2746794">We say that in the pretrial context there should instead be a presumption of regularity in the prosecutor's action and that the burden should be on the Defendant to show concrete and specific facts from which a conclusion of actual vindictiveness on the part of the prosecutor can be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.901" offset="2830073">Now, this presumption of regulatory in prosecutorial charging decisions is the rule in every other context of which I am aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.756" offset="2865495">This is the only exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.458" offset="2872287">And I'd like to call to the Court's attention the treatment of selective prosecution claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.862" offset="2897887">These claims are quite analogous, it seems to me, to vindictive prosecution claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.933" offset="2918158">Surely the bringing of a prosecution on account of a person's race or political views or religion is every bit as invidious a practice as bringing a prosecution to retaliate against the exercise of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.026" offset="2978553">Equally, the possibility of an invidiously discriminatory motive underlying a prosecution is present in virtually every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.965" offset="3018363">Yet, it has never been thought, and I think it's quite clear, that those things combined are not enough to make out a prima facie case and to require the prosecutor to come in and explain his reasons for his actions, let alone rigidly restricting the reasons for his actions to practically nothing that can justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.129" offset="3094954">Now, in Pearce and Perry the Court confronted cases in which vindictiveness appeared to be the most likely explanation for the increased penalty exposure of the defendants, and indeed cases in which no non-vindictive explanation was ever tendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.840" offset="3169873">In fact in the Rice case, which was the companion of Pearce, the district court found actual vindictive retaliation against the appeal, and in Pearce... in the Pearce case the Court described the state's assertion as nothing more than the naked power to do what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.504" offset="3248450">Now, in the pretrial context we submit that the circumstances are entirely different, and this difference consists principally of two elements: The first element is that the exercise of rights by defendants in pretrial contexts is an entirely commonplace event.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.548" offset="3328698">It is not likely to provoke a vindictive or retaliatory response by the prosecutor that the defendant has pleaded not guilty, that he's asked for a jury trial, that he's moved to suppress evidence, that he sought a continuance or asked for a severance or a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.475" offset="3388362">These are everyday occurrences, everyday grist to the prosecutor's mill, and to presume that the prosecutor would react in an unprofessional and unfair manner by retaliating against that kind of occurrence is simply contrary to common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.120" offset="3454922">In fact, I submit that the prosecutor generally would be astounded if a defendant exercised no rights in the pretrial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.459" offset="3488254">Now, not only is the exercise of a right by a defendant in the pretrial context therefore not a likely occasion for a retaliatory response by the prosecutor, but equally the process of preparation for the trial itself will inevitably give the prosecutor a better grasp of the facts of the case and can be expected in some cases to reveal reasons for concluding that the initial charges were too lenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.360" offset="3595878">So that this is again a context in which it is not unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.395" offset="3612074">Superseding indictments are common.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.347" offset="3619807">Sometimes the initial severity of charges is reduced because the prosecutor concludes in his pretrial preparation that they were too severe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.416" offset="4584143">When the... as I said at the outset, it's almost inconceivable, except in a case in which there's already been plea negotiations and the defendant has agreed to plead guilty before any charges are actually filed, it's virtually inconceivable that rights will not have been exercised by the defendant in a criminal case by the time a superseding indictment is returned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.726" offset="7301400">Well, I don't believe so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.078" offset="7306729">This case certainly is not and has never been one involving actual vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.649" offset="7329090">Petitioner is certainly correct in stating that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.934" offset="7338180">It has been conceded from the outset that no actual vindictiveness in the terms of a subjective malice or bad faith on the part of the second prosecutor was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.957" offset="7378304">However, the prophylactic measure established by this Court in Blackledge v. Perry does not require or wait for a showing of actual vindictiveness or a showing of actual retaliatory motivation on the part of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.931" offset="7430236">That's made very clear by this Court in Blackledge, which explicitly states that they did not find actual vindictiveness in the case before it and disclaimed any reliance on such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.072" offset="7474749">Rather than a remedial rule which is designed only to cure the effects of actual vindictiveness, the Blackledge Court fashioned a preventive measure that went to or was designed to purge not only the possibility of actual retaliation, actual vindictiveness, but also to free defendants from the fear of such retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.653" offset="7561057">This Court recognized in that case, as well as in the preceding case of North Carolina v. Pearce, that due to the extraordinary difficulty of proving actual motivations and subjective intent of a judge or a prosecutor, any requirement of actual vindictiveness would completely undermine the due process protection that this Court desired to erect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.832" offset="7649769">Therefore, in recognition of that, the Blackledge Court devised this prophylactic measure which is applicable in those situations where the hazard of vindictiveness is sufficient enough to implicate the underlying rationale of that measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.159" offset="7707134">Contrary to the Petitioner's counsel's assertions, it is not a situation, it is not a measure, that is applicable every time there is an exercise of a procedural right and a certain upping of the ante, so to speak, follows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.216" offset="7763349">That is not the ruling of Blackledge v. Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.149" offset="7771082">It is also not the ruling of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.918" offset="7782158">The bottom line analysis is that only in those situations that generate a substantial, a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness will they then apply a prophylactic measure, particularly in the pretrial setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.511" offset="7840463">Obviously, the exercise of procedural rights by the defendant is indeed commonplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.082" offset="7858749">Obviously, reactions in certain ways by the prosecutor is as well commonplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.867" offset="7877975">Not every one of those interplays will give rise to the application of the prophylactic measures set forth in Blackledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.354" offset="7903888">However, in those situations where the circumstances do give rise to the requisite substantial realistic likelihood of vindictiveness, then the prophylactic measure does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.863" offset="7953939">Both the Court of Appeals in this case as well as the trial court, recognizing the similarity between this case and the facts in Blackledge v. Perry, held that a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness was present, that the hazard inherent in the facts before the court were substantial enough to warrant the application of the prophylactic rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.129" offset="11382980">The ongoing investigation which is spoken of by the Petitioner was in effect completed prior to May 24, 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.386" offset="11519967">All these factors were known to the prosecution prior to Mr. Goodwin's election for a jury trial, yet they were content to proceed to trial at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.273" offset="11659565">Respondent's position is simply that the decision below is required by this Court's previous holdings in North Carolina v. Pearce and Blackledge vs. Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.462" offset="11700316">We are not arguing... and as I believe I made clear already... that the prophylactic rule is always applicable in the pretrial setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.683" offset="11829152">Further, this Court or other courts certainly would be entitled to fashion a preliminary procedure such as that fashioned in Franks v.

            <text syncTime="2941.411" offset="11904071">Perhaps even more importantly, if this Court eschews reliance on Blackledge because there is no actual vindictiveness in this case, this Court and other courts will be left with a standard which will require explorations into the subjective intent and motivations of prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.773" offset="11977527">Every word, every deed, every action of the prosecutor will come under scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.251" offset="12047431">Finally, we are not advocating that this position will unduly restrict prosecutorial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.006" offset="12078464">Obviously Blackledge v. Perry to some degree imposes a restraint in the name of due process upon the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.362" offset="12111901">However, as in this case, it is not unreasonable restraint if proper prosecutorial procedure is followed at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.183" offset="12143248">We are not asking for any change in procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.868" offset="12153906">The present system and procedures allows for deliberation by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.372" offset="12171983">This Court's opinion in Lavasco, or United States v. Lavasco certainly establishes that the prosecution is under no specific or strict time restraints with respect to the bringing of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.596" offset="12224855">There is certainly plenty of time generally, certainly plenty of time in this case, given the fact that the prosecution did have the information available to it prior to the defendant's election of a jury trial to make a decision that it would be content to live with throughout the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.082" offset="13282814">I believe that what you are arguing for is kind of a mini-double-double jeopardy, isn't it, that it doesn't start when the jury is empaneled but when the indictment is first returned, that the prosecutor would be best advised to just get everything out on the table right then because if he doesn't, there's going to be judicial inquiry into why he didn't from then on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.847" offset="13385841">But is that really sound, because we have held double jeopardy starts when the jury is empaneled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.619" offset="13412904">--Due process rationale advanced by this Court, although perhaps having implications of double jeopardy principles, is not confined by the double jeopardy approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.908" offset="13454073">Indeed, a significant difference would be that if a prosecutor is negligent or does make a mistake the first time around, the defendant does not walk free and clear as in a double jeopardy situation where if double jeopardy applies, the defendant may be free to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.235" offset="13507362">In this situation the negligence would only go so far as to free the defendant of the more serious charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.138" offset="13530977">We believe that if the information is known to the Government, if the one out of 100 attorneys, Chief Justice Burger, are aware of the facts, that the interest in encouraging proper prosecutorial procedure should be considered by this Court, and that is mistakes occur, as perhaps in this case occurred when the prosecutor did not act on that information to which he had access to and to which he knew, that any cost because of that mistake should be borne by the Government, that the appropriate response is not the sacrifice of due process interests which this Court has recognized in North Carolina v. Pearce and Blackledge v. Perry.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3397.619" offset="13728985">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.654" offset="13733060">I have to take strenuous issue with several characterizations of my colleague about what is going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.677" offset="13769214">And the first of these has to do with his confusion of the prosecution with the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.581" offset="13796799">The prosecution, in his view, includes the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.616" offset="13808920">Let's keep in mind... and although I don't want to concentrate too much on the particular facts of this case... these initial charges were brought by a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.055" offset="13838700">Now, the prosecutor who allegedly had an adequate opportunity to make a binding decision... and let me say this is not just punishing the Government if you don't allow the increase in charges, but punishing the public at large... this is a prosecutor who was assigned to the Hyattsville Magistrate Court, and what happens there is she walks in in the morning, she is handed 20 or 30 files of cases that are on the docket that day, she struggles as best she can with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.456" offset="13948309">The idea that the Government should be bound by what happened at that initial proceeding and should be barred from bringing what are otherwise entirely appropriate charges seems to me quite indefensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.780" offset="13997629">Now, let me say for example, suppose the U.S. Attorney had a policy that he announced... and we don't need to go this far, but suppose he had a policy that said whenever a case is going to go to trial we are going to assign a prosecutor to review the initial charge with great care to determine whether it was too severe or too lenient or whether it should be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.109" offset="14082892">This is announced policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.909" offset="14090102">Now, I find it hard to believe that such a policy would violate the due process clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.882" offset="14118001">Yet that is the inescapable conclusion if you agree with my colleague and with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.000" offset="14138481">Now, let me turn to this question of whether the exercise of the right to jury trial is only one of a narrow category of cases in which there is a substantial hazard of a vindictive response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.343" offset="14191875">The exercise of a right to a jury trial is one of the most routine, common occurrences in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.097" offset="14218833">If that is enough to cause a prosecutor to retaliate vindictively and out of spite against the defendant, then any exercise of a right by a defendant at the pretrial stage is going to be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.221" offset="14267317">Now, in fact, the prosecutor... the Respondent says in his brief it is a lot of work for the prosecutor to have to try a case instead of having it tried in Magistrate's Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.910" offset="14310158">That does not distinguish the case from Colten v. Kentucky where it is a lot of work for the judge to have to try the case at the second level when, if the defendant did not seek a trial de novo, the judge would not be burdened with that extra effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.502" offset="14364492">Also, with respect to Justice Blackmun's question, the Court in Colten said precisely the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.506" offset="14396466">They said that the first level judge was likely to impose a higher sentence if he was aware that the sentence he was imposed would limit the sentence that could be imposed if a trial de novo was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.798" offset="14437635">The same kind of thing is going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.083" offset="14450801">The prosecutor plainly has incentives to bring higher charges where the prosecutor himself has brought the initial charges and not, as here, a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.272" offset="14487581">And also I might say that from talking to prosecutors in the Ninth Circuit where we have had most of our vindictive prosecution case and most of our losses, there is unquestionably a chilling effect on the prosecutor's decision to re-evaluate the case because if even, no matter how appropriate they may feel some superseding or changed charge is, they know that if they bring that charge there's going to be a full dress hearing in the District Court, followed by an appeal, and it is just more grief than it's worth, and it's too bad that the appropriate charges can't be brought, but in most cases that is the result of a rule like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.147" offset="14643062">Now, I also wanted to point out that Respondent has really drawn back from the Court of Appeals rule as to what kind of justifications are acceptable because the Court of Appeals said we would have to show that the charges could not have been brought, and by that I think they meant we would have to show that we didn't know or have evidence of some aspect of the offense behavior itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.548" offset="14740656">In this case we knew all the facts about the offense, but there were additional facts that came along later on that properly entered the prosecutor's discretion and judgment that the Fourth Circuit would not--</text>
