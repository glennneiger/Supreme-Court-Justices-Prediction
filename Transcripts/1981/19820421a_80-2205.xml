            <text syncTime="280.080" offset="1250833">Therefore, the question devolves not on whether or not the clerk must or must not... whether it's a ministerial or discretionary duty, but on the function.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.455" offset="1300361">The test is whether the clerk is acting as an official aide and whether he is functioning in that capacity as clerk, as the Petitioner in this case was in fact doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.065" offset="1794807">The complaint admits that this was his duty as the court clerk, that he created these procedures, and that all that he failed to do was to create perfect procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.373" offset="2148087">The majority of circuits who have decided whether or not clerks are absolutely immune have held that they are as long as the act is pursuant to a court order or directive or intimately related to the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.917" offset="10866193">Indeed, I would argue that it deserves less immunity because normally court clerks perform... have less discretion in their duties than say governors, cabinet officers, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.058" offset="10914781">Petitioner's primary policy argument is that, as we've heard, the clerks serve as an aide to the judge and that they are important to judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.516" offset="10952606">Well, this Court has made it clear that official immunity depends not on an official's status or his location in the judicial process, but on whether the judgments of the official are functionally comparable to the judgments of a judge in deciding cases, as this Court pointed out in the Dennis opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.977" offset="11022405">Since the Petitioner's responsibility for the unconstitutional arrest in this case in failing to have adequate procedures had nothing to do with deciding the merits of a case, this functional comparability argument, ground, is conclusive that judicial immunity cannot apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.674" offset="12161240">That very well could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.126" offset="12167091">There is also a statute in Illinois that gives immunity for discretionary acts of officials doing governmental functions, as in most states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.565" offset="12200841">And how Illinois would interplay with these two statutes is unclear in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.219" offset="12223411">I would also point out that the case, the new case cited by Petitioner, the new Illinois Supreme Court decision, points out that in 1870, I believe, when the Illinois constitution was promulgated, court clerks were not considered even non-judicial officers of the court, that they were county officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.180" offset="12299271">So they didn't even have that proximity under the law at the time 1983 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.084" offset="12322885">Petitioner also argues that immunity is necessary to promote judicial efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.540" offset="12360711">Well, the opposite is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.606" offset="12368965">The protection of constitutional rights and the promotion of judicial administration are clearly mutually reinforcing goals, not antagonistic at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.264" offset="12415568">The facts of this case I believe demonstrate the possibility of a clerk's liability for an constitutional arrest caused by ineffective procedures for handling warrant recalls would have two effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.388" offset="12464051">It would be an incentive to have more efficient procedures and thereby to reduce the incidence of unconstitutional arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.261" offset="12491636">And I think it's interesting to note that Petitioner himself recognized this effect of 1983 liability when he in his office memo to his clerk that's on page 20 of the appendix... that memo warns that deputies who failed to follow correct procedures on the handling of recall orders may be subject, as well as may subject the clerk's office, to liability under Section 1983.</text>

            <label>Mr. John S. Elson</label>
            <text syncTime="3148.681" offset="12725276">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.616" offset="12729037">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.733" offset="12737501">Before we recessed for lunch I was discussing why absolute immunity is not necessary to promote judicial efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.889" offset="12770102">And I was pointing out, the Petitioner's own memo to his clerks, to his subordinates, showed recognition that 1983 liability is indeed an incentive to promote efficient judicial procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.731" offset="12825481">And I would point out that if it's an incentive to Petitioner's subordinates there's no reason to think that it wouldn't be an incentive to Petitioner himself to use adequate procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.754" offset="12857560">There is a third criteria for establishing absolute immunity from damages, and that is that Petitioner must show that there are adequate safeguards built into the process by which the court clerk or any official acts that reduce the need for a damage, 1983 damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.952" offset="12958392">This Court has never found absolute immunity justified unless there were adequate, such adequate safeguards built into the process by which the official acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.225" offset="12995486">And those safeguards, which were described in Economou versus Butts... the most essential ones are the right to an adversarial hearing, the right to appeal, and recourse to precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.699" offset="13041357">Petitioner's failure here to have adequate safeguards, being a purely administrative... to have adequate procedures for handling these recalls, is purely an administrative type of action and occurred wholly outside of the adjudicative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.892" offset="13098095">So there is no possibility of such safeguards being present, and therefore there's no need... there's no reduction in the need for a Section 1983 damage remedy to restrain constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.800" offset="13149713">And this is an independent requirement of absolute immunity the Petitioner has the burden of showing, the existence of these safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.789" offset="13181687">In response to Petitioner's argument, I would point out that essentially I think Petitioner has conceded the question presented of whether he's entitled to absolute immunity in his response to Justice O'Connor's question as to whether there is... as to whether a clerk would be immune if the clerk violated a court order and discriminated against an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.927" offset="13306239">In conceding that there would be no immunity in that case, I think that essentially essentially concedes the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.062" offset="13326823">I think that concession is dictated in sum, by the three separate requirements for absolute immunity that this Court has set up in all of its immunity cases: that there be adequate safeguards, that there be policy reasons that make immunity necessary for the accomplishment of the official's duties, and that there be an equivalent historical immunity as a background.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.456" offset="13492335">If he is not performing something which is essentially the same as what the Senator would do for himself--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3359.536" offset="13568717">It's certainly derivative immunity in the Gravel case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.421" offset="13580211">--That's correct, because the legislative aide was performing a task that would be immune if the legislator had himself performed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.193" offset="13619290">Derivative immunity of a court clerk, however, would be not a judicial type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.997" offset="13642487">It would be related to carrying out a judge's order, and therefore almost as an arm of the judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.793" offset="13709674">The task itself wouldn't be quasi-judicial because it's not functionally like deciding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.947" offset="13730363">There would be a derivative immunity, an absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.663" offset="13741230">I think the term "quasi-judicial" has been used in many senses, but there would be an absolute immunity because he'd be carrying out an explicit order of a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.402" offset="13772159">And in the same sense I think that the Gravel case indicates that just because a court clerk happens to be an aide of the judge, just as the legislative aide was an aide of the Senator, that status does not in itself confer immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.180" offset="13847287">There has to be a functional equivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.716" offset="13853452">Because Petitioner has not met any of the three separate requirements for absolute immunity this Court has set forth, there is no basis for the claim of absolute immunity in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.129" offset="13931088">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.581" offset="13952822">Clearly on the face of the complaint, the Petitioner in this case could have done no more than what he did in creating the procedures in conjunction with the general order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.603" offset="13996916">Furthermore, the courtroom deputy in this case followed each of the procedures that was assigned to him and there are no allegations that the deputy clerk involved in this case did not comply or implement the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.828" offset="14041847">As far as intentional violation of the court orders, it is clear that the clerk of the court is amenable to alternative available remedies when he intentionally violates a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.587" offset="14100884">He is subject... he is answerable to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.370" offset="14107989">He is subject to contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.055" offset="14114781">He is subject to removal from office, just as well as a judge, and in addition would be subject to the criminal analogue of the Section 1983 Act under Section 242 for criminal intentional violations of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.731" offset="14181445">The clerk would enjoy no greater immunity than a judge or a prosecutor would for intentional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.968" offset="14206418">Furthermore, it's clear that the negligent act that occurred here, the mere inadvertent mislaying of the warrant recall order, was something that could not have been prevented even with the threat of the memo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.192" offset="14263365">Mistakes will happen in a large system such as the one in Cook County and merely the fact that this memo was there was not something that even could prevent this one isolated incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.385" offset="14320103">Clearly, the clerk is intimately related to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.670" offset="14333269">He is not acting independent of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.853" offset="14341942">As this Court held in Shadwick versus City of Tampa, the clerk when working with the court is intimately related to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.276" offset="14375692">He is a judicial officer and, when acting under the supervision of a judge, he should be accorded the same protection of absolute judicial immunity as the judge would be if the judge in fact had performed the act of failing, in this case, either to adequately communicate to the police department a warrant recall order or in fact created procedures as he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.093" offset="14478928">For these reasons, we've asked that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals be reversed.</text>
