            <text syncTime="25.248" offset="230826">Mr. Huntington, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="68.077" offset="402189">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, these consolidated cases are here on appeals from the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.000" offset="437820">The key issues are whether New Hampshire's restriction on hydroelectric exports places an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause, and whether the restriction is pre empted by the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.110" offset="498320">The facts are straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.178" offset="510545">New England Power Company is part of a holding company system that serves customers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.567" offset="544087">It owns several hydroelectric units along the Connecticut River located in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.321" offset="567074">Energy from these units is delivered to an integrated regional transmission grid and flows freely in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.491" offset="599780">In 1980, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission invoked a 1913 state statute and ordered New England Power Company to sell within New Hampshire the output from the units.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.535" offset="652025">The Commission did not order NEP to interrupt physically the way the power is being generated or transmitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.824" offset="685148">Rather, it sought to capture exclusively for the benefit of New Hampshire citizens the economic benefits of these units.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.094" offset="718167">New Hampshire's attempt to retain the economic benefits of an important natural resource exclusively for its own citizens violates the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.802" offset="765082">There are two mainstream cases by this Court which are directly on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.391" offset="791414">West versus Kansas Natural Gas Company involved a state prohibition against the export of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.878" offset="821298">And in a case even more on point, in Pennsylvania against West Virginia, this Court struck down a statute that required natural gas companies to serve local needs first, before exporting any natural gas.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="188.737" offset="884828">So you say that the Federal Power Act of '35 doesn't either hinder or help you, or at any rate you don't need it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="200.545" offset="932057">Well, our commerce clause argument is based on the commerce clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.549" offset="952015">In addition to that we have a pre emption argument that the New Hampshire restriction is pre empted by the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.622" offset="980331">Now, New Hampshire seeks to rebut our commerce clause argument by relying on Section 201(b) of the Federal Power Act, so the Federal Power Act is involved in our commerce clause argument to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.995" offset="1025785">And I would like to turn now to that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.298" offset="1039055">New Hampshire's argument is that that is an affirmative grant of authority, and therefore Congress affirmatively authorized them to burden interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.252" offset="2838891">202(f), Part 2, was enacted in 1953 to make clear that the Federal Power Commission's jurisdiction did not extend to international sales, wholesale sales between a single state and a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.114" offset="2902317">Congress in enacting 202(f) was concerned that these sales might then be beyond either federal or state authority under the Attleboro decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.521" offset="2955920">So in 202(f) Congress added a provision that said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="710.658" offset="2972429">"The states may regulate any such transaction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="715.127" offset="2990297">And the legislative history of 202(f), which is House Report Number 978, 83rd Congress, First Session, makes clear that Congress added that because they were concerned that the states might not have that authority under the Attleboro gap... under the Attleboro decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.539" offset="3059992">So 202(f) is an example of a clear delegation to the states of authority to regulate wholesale sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.844" offset="3089249">The states may regulate any such transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.146" offset="3106385">That stands in total contrast to 201(b), which says that nothing shall deprive a state of any lawful authority now exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.037" offset="3154033">I would like to turn now to New Hampshires second argument to avoid the commerce clause contention we make.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.141" offset="3186425">And that is that the state has a proprietary interest in the river itself, and that justifies this restriction on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.479" offset="3223727">Even if the state has a proprietary interest, and we submit it does not, that interest does not justify restricting commerce in a product which is privately manufactured using the river's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.656" offset="3280465">Electricity is a product generated by New England Power Company using the river's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.927" offset="3305543">By way of analogy, flour is a product that can be milled using the river's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.981" offset="3329785">Clearly, New Hampshire does not have the authority under the commerce clause to restrict commerce in flour.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.186" offset="3358624">We submit it does not have any authority to restrict commerce in a privately produced product such as electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.975" offset="3397703">This is the clear teaching of Foster Packing, a 1928 decision that says a state may not prevent privately owned articles of trade from being sold in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.352" offset="3567290">I think there may be some question as to whether all wholesale sales in interstate commerce are beyond the constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.575" offset="3600100">However, the restriction we have here is very akin to the Pennsylvania against West Virginia decision, and that case has been reaffirmed time and time again, as recently as last year in the BT Investment case, in the Philadelphia against New Jersey landfill case, and stands for the very solid proposition that a state cannot erect a barrier to the interstate commerce of a product generated from a natural resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.146" offset="3730398">We submit in any event that New Hampshire does not have a proprietary interest in the river in the same way that it owns, say, state forest lands or the state capitol building.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.437" offset="3775538">The interest New Hampshire does have is a regulatory interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.828" offset="3825171">But this Court's decision in Hughes against Oklahoma, striking down a state barrier on the export of minnows, stands firmly for the proposition that this ownership interest in natural resources, wildlife, and so on, does not protect the state regulation from commerce clause scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.927" offset="3913569">The ownership interest is simply the equivalent of saying, yes, the state may regulate for valid conservation or waste purposes, but those regulations must still pass muster under the commerce clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.645" offset="4128400">We agree that Section 201(b) does not act as a grant of Congressional authority, but instead should be construed this Court as a saving clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.267" offset="4166957">For purposes of my argument, however, I will assume a contrary interpretation of Section 201(b), and will assume that Congress did in fact give to New Hampshire the authority to limit or ban the exportation of hydroelectric power and that the PUC's order fell within the grant of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.565" offset="4268103">Such an interpretation would, in our view, present serious Constitutional questions centering on the limits of Congressional authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.068" offset="4382101">In other words, this case is not a case where we argue that Congress was incapable of giving to the states authority which it wouldn't have had in absence of Congressional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.189" offset="4426614">What we do suggest is that that power which Congress has and which the states willingly gave up to Congress when it entered into the Constitution must be exercised in a way so that the exercise of Congressional power is exercised in some rational manner consistent with the legitimate ends that Congress sought to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.455" offset="4511669">Now, before I pursue that question, Your Honor, I want to briefly describe what we consider Massachusetts and Rhode Island's interest in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.411" offset="4555450">On one level, of course, our interest is as narrow as is New Hampshire's.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.539" offset="4623995">They are then becoming New Hampshire residents and New Hampshire citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.724" offset="4636743">But what is clear is that the fiscal impact of the PUC's order by its very terms is to shift the economic burden of some $25 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.532" offset="4675927">Our estimates exceed that amount, but we are willing to accept that at a minimum $25 million is being shifted from the shoulders of New Hampshire residents, rather, from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, but the real impact, I suggest, Your Honor, and this is, I think, perhaps the primary reason we are here, exceeds and transcends the dollars and cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.279" offset="4758996">The decision of the PUC threatens the long standing cooperative efforts of the New England states with respect to energy matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.033" offset="4789925">The New England Power Pool represents perhaps this nation's most sophisticated and highly integrated energy power pool arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.639" offset="4824407">This arrangement, however, is a finely tuned arrangement, and one which, as the Commissioner of the Rhode Island PUC testified at the New Hampshire hearing suggested, could unravel fairly easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.279" offset="4874980">Moreover, the PUC's order invites the very sort of economic retaliation and isolation which these same three states were subject to when they were governed by the Articles of Confederation, which leads me to the commerce clause, or back to the commerce clause, and to the authority which the states willingly gave up to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.843" offset="4957213">While we concede that this authority is expansive, there are certain internal and external constraints, we suggest, on Congress's power to legislate in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.418" offset="4999531">I intend to focus my argument on the internal constraints implicated by the commerce clause, and suggest that if the Court adopts New Hampshire's interpretation of Section 201(b), that this case then presents one of those rare occasions for holding that Congress has exceeded its power under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.612" offset="5072256">In prior instances where the Court has been faced with this argument, it has followed essentially a two step analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.164" offset="5094513">First, whether the subject matter which Congress acts falls within the broad reach of the commerce clause, and here there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.586" offset="5128158">We concede that Congress had the authority to regulate in the energy area generally, and with respect to hydroelectric power specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.192" offset="5158565">In fact, it forms the premise of our own commerce clause claim and our pre emption claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.262" offset="5178836">But the second step and the second question is contested here, and that is whether Congress's action is reasonably related to the goal of regulating interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.218" offset="5218751">This question, which is essentially a limited means and ends analysis, requires that there must be some showing, however minimal, that Congress has acted in a rational manner, and here, it is our position that whether one looks for an articulated purpose on the part of Congress or indeed for any plausible reason for Congress's action, none emerge to support a grant of authority to New Hampshire which effectively keeps the benefits, the economic benefits of hydroelectric power within her borders at the expense of her sister states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.922" offset="5353543">The fact that similar authority was not provided to the vast majority of other states underscores the irrationality of Congress's action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.866" offset="5413311">Well, we suggest, Your Honor, that labeling it as a grandfather clause in this case doesn't assist New Hampshire, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.538" offset="5444031">The first is, it was a curious kind of grandfather clause, because New Hampshire argues that it didn't simply lock in lawful authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.144" offset="5474438">Part of its argument is that it gave to a few states authority which it didn't have before under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.631" offset="5500351">But secondly, we suggest that calling it a grandfather clause may describe what Congressman Rodgers had in mind, but in other instances where the Court has upheld the rationality of grandfather clauses it has looked to see whether the locking in of the inequity, if we can call it that, furthers some other rational, some other legitimate purpose which the legislature or the city council in the case of New Orleans versus Duke had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.699" offset="5604632">Here, of course, it is not a temporary solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.734" offset="5616753">It is a... to a national problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.619" offset="5632322">What it does is to give to New Hampshire forever power, important power, within its borders, this economic benefit, yet at the time same deny to the rest of the union, and here specifically Massachusetts and Rhode Island, this very same power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.147" offset="5698464">This is not an instance where Congress simply follows the problem, as it did in the decision which the Court upheld last year, the statute which the Court upheld last year in Hodell, where Congress dealt with a problem, and after extensive hearings found that although the statute, the Strip Mining Act fell peculiarly upon Virginia, what Congress was doing was simply following the problem wherever it found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.930" offset="5801595">Nor is it an instance, we suggest, as in the voting rights case, the Katzenbach case, where Congress selectively carves out its remedial powers in response to a national problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.237" offset="5846735">Here, Massachusetts and Rhode Island find themselves on the receiving end of action which we assume for argument purposes but for Congressional action would violate the commerce clause, yet at the same time our action is judged, of course, by the higher standard of the commerce clause, since we lack that Congressional grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.317" offset="5927087">We suggest that such an unprecedented result is contrary to the very purpose of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.321" offset="5955091">This Court has in the past found great meaning in the silences, in the great silences of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.459" offset="5979646">The Court has interpreted that provision in the name of national unity and free commerce as inhibiting the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.230" offset="6006709">We suggest that there is another great silence in the commerce clause which places certain limits on Congress, admittedly very narrow ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.151" offset="6038473">Those limits at a minimum preclude Congress from selectively choking off interstate commerce in a manner that bears no rational relationship to the purpose of the commerce clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.696" offset="6540651">The appellants, to prevail in this case, must carry their burden of demonstrating that that Act was an unconstitutional Act by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.140" offset="6602405">I ask your indulgence to treat briefly some further facts which have already been referred to in the earlier argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.562" offset="6636051">Section 201(b), as I think you know, provided in fairly explicit terms that a state would not be deprived of its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.677" offset="6724553">That Act of Congress adopted the practice then in existence in four states in the union and wrote it right into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.533" offset="6763946">The hydroelectric power plants in New Hampshire on the Connecticut River, which is in fact wholly within New Hampshire, generate electricity without any interstate character in the generation of the electricity itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.292" offset="6826953">If there is any doubt about what that section of 201(b) means, the appellants have called upon the right state to give the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.946" offset="6857673">That section, which was an amendment to the Federal Power Act when it proceeded through Congress, was introduced, was sponsored, and shepherded through Congress by representatives of the state of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.206" offset="6914620">In doing so, the Congressman from the state of New Hampshire addressed his colleagues by saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.543" offset="6943982">"The Senate bill as originally drawn would deprive certain states, I think five in all, of certain rights which they have over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across the state line. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.766" offset="7188906">In fact, that statute, which was enacted in 1913, applied to the Connecticut River hydro plants after 1926, and I believe the record shows that all of the hydroelectric plants subject to this appeal were built or taken over by the New England Power Company after 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.812" offset="7261109">I think the record also shows that in 1934, the Public Utilities Commission was asked by the New England Power Company or its predecessor with respect to these dams for permission to export hydroelectric energy out of New Hampshire, and that permission was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.237" offset="7318787">It has been exercised from the beginning, and the owners of the current dams have taken their interest in these dams, apparently realizing that expressly, and I believe there is reference to that in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.895" offset="7373435">It is our position, in fact, contrary to our opponents', that that authority was exercised, and that the other states, West Virginia, Maine, and Wisconsin, had also statutes on the books at that time, and it was authority which had been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.405" offset="7435502">It was lawful authority, and we believe the reference to lawful authority in the statute can have only one intelligible meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.642" offset="7464446">It meant enacted into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.177" offset="7474581">They were writing at the time in an obvious context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.936" offset="7529543">It is placed in the section in which the other authority of states regulating hydroelectric energy export is also dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.292" offset="7567055">That is, the authority to control interstate shipments for ultimate consumption and the authority to regulate wholly intrastate authority, and as further support for our view of the clear intention of Congress as expressed in this Act, in the 1978 amendments, the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act, a further amendment to 201(b) allowed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require pooling, to mandate interconnection of hydroelectric plants, and there is an exception created in that amendment to this provision upon which we rely today, indicating that Congress had some idea that without that exception the 201(b) as we construe it, and as we think it clearly takes effect in this case, would have prevented mandated pooling ordered by the federal authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.985" offset="12449758">The Attorney General stated that it is not significant whether the Section 201(b) savings clause is a grant or a savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.358" offset="12495316">We differ there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.144" offset="12502421">We say that is very significant, and that is the square holding of BT Investment Managers just last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.398" offset="12531469">When presented with a clause such as this, the Court must ask two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.202" offset="12558637">First, does the clause interdict pre emption?</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.189" offset="12578594">We say clearly it does to some extent, and we have discussed in our brief exactly to what extent it does interdict Part 2 pre emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.176" offset="12610568">The second question is, does the clause go beyond interdicting pre emption and affirmatively give to the states an authority to regulate commerce that the states did not previously have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.685" offset="12672531">In BT Investment Managers, the Court found that savings clause did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.272" offset="12694891">We submit that this savings clause, which reads virtually identically to the Bank Holding Company Act savings clause in BT Investment Managers, also does not give the state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.532" offset="12751943">In fact, New Hampshire concedes in their brief at Page 15 that the language of 201(b) is not that usually used by a legislature when authorizing an act.</text>
