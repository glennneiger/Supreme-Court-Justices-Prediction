            <text syncTime="15.693" offset="204212">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, concerning the disclosure of whether nuclear weapons are or are not stored at a particular site.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.721" offset="272339">That substantive information, the storage or non storage of nuclear weapons at a particular site, is a military secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.625" offset="304000">In the early 1970's, in response to the objections of local citizens to the alleged storage of nuclear weapons at the Waikele Branch of the Lualualei Naval Magazine on the island of Oahu, the Navy considered moving that storage facility six miles away to the West Loch Branch of that same Lualualei Naval Magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.192" offset="402220">The Navy has never confirmed nor denied that nuclear weapons were in fact stored at Waikele.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.262" offset="426566">In 1975, the Navy made an assessment of the effect of that transfer on the environment, and in June of 1977 a portion of that classified document was released to the public as an environmental impact assessment, concluding that the construction of the 48 earth covered magazines and associated buildings and the provision of security for those buildings would have no significant environmental impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.366" offset="546938">No mention was made of nuclear weapons storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.483" offset="563448">In 1978, the Department of the Navy prepared a candidate or generic environmental impact statement dealing with nuclear aspects of Naval systems storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.577" offset="615797">That candidate statement--</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="124.481" offset="639412">It is a type of NEPA performance, Justice Brennan, that is recognized by the Council of Environmental Quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.420" offset="679118">It is to be distinguished from the type thing that was done, say, with respect to the Southwest Energy Study, where you take a series, a single prototype that will be repeated in a number of different instances, such as the Southwest Energy Study dealing with dams along the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="743693">This one, by contrast, deals with a situation where you have a single circumstance that might be repeated applicable to a generic situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.320" offset="782772">It seemed particularly appropriate in this instance, given the secret nature of storage at any particular site.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.926" offset="817149">That candidate statement did conclude, in general... it is set forth as Appendix G to the petition for certiorari... that the nuclear aspects of weapons storage do not constitute an environmental factor per se, but it did not discuss any issues pertaining to nuclear storage at any specific site.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.637" offset="891964">This suit was filed in March of 1978, alleging that the West Loch facility would house nuclear weapons, and seeking to enjoin the Secretary of Defense and various Navy officials from expanding the facility until they complied with NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.318" offset="978690">The District Court concluded that none of those Acts was offended by the proposed transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.840" offset="1020800">With regard to both the Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act, the Court relied on findings that were made in the declassified portion of the 1975 assessment that was released to the public as an environmental impact assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.020" offset="1105541">With respect to NEPA, the District Judge concluded that submission of an environmental impact statement would conflict with the security data provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, and also with the security classification guides prepared jointly by the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.482" offset="1175445">Under those circumstances, the District Court ruled that defendants have complied with the National Environmental Policy Act to the fullest extent possible within the restrictions of the security classification guides and the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.122" offset="1229988">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.074" offset="1237720">It directed the Navy to prepare a "hypothetical environmental impact statement" which would assess the potential consequences of storage of nuclear weapons at this particular site.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.251" offset="1294458">It is that judgment of the Court of Appeals that is under review today.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.553" offset="1315670">The issues in this case affect two statutes and three policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.207" offset="1342315">The primary statute and the primary policy are those of NEPA, which requires Federal decision makers to take environmental factors into account in making their final judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.348" offset="1394873">The second NEPA objective, which is arguably a separate one, but can also be regarded as totally subsumed within the first, is to make certain kinds of information available to the public for whatever purpose the public wishes to make of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.742" offset="1464463">Both of these objectives contemplate disclosure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="334.611" stopTime="339.165">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="334.611" offset="1479928">Are you saying NEPA is much like FOIA in the second regard, then?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="339.165" stopTime="483.726">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="339.165" offset="1498109">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.848" offset="1500826">Indeed, Justice Rehnquist, NEPA expressly ties into FOIA by its incorporation of that document by reference, and the public disclosure provisions, the public disclosure language simply says, disclosure to the public as required by 5 USC, and so forth, which is the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.745" offset="1580447">On the face of things, the policy of the Atomic Energy Act, by contrast, and of other classification laws, is the preservation of secrecy of information concerning nuclear weapons, so that on its face you do have a potential tension, and it is well settled law that where you have tension between the National Environmental Policy Act and another statute, that it is NEPA that must yield.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.444" offset="1671249">But it is the government's position in this case that these statutes and their facially conflicting policies can be largely accommodated to a greater extent than is true in the case of conflict between the National Environmental Policy and most other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.822" offset="1744705">The key to this accommodation is the regulations that have been adopted by the Department of Defense that concede... or, I shouldn't say concede, but take the position that regardless of whether they would be required to have adopted such regulations or not, that the Department of Defense regards NEPA as applicable to all of its activities, including secret activities, with the appropriate secrecy protection being provided by classification applicable to the NEPA documents themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.678" offset="1888169">This case does have one feature that complicates it and that will not be present in most of these instances where NEPA will be applicable because of the Department of Defense regulations to classified activities of the military, and the feature of this case that distinguishes it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.640" offset="1960058">The secret is whether nuclear weapons are or are not being stored at a specific site.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.896" offset="1993077">Therefore, one of the things that cannot be disclosed is whether environmental considerations pertaining to nuclear storage at that site have or have not been considered by the decision makers, because to reveal that fact would reveal the secret itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.726" offset="2076356">I suppose, Mr. Solicitor General, or I will put it this way: What would be the consequence if the hypothetical was, yes, we are storing nuclear weapons of the highest power at this site, hypothetically?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="509.544" offset="2179591">I think that the basic approach that the Court of Appeals attempted was a middle ground, and the attempt of the Court of Appeals was to say, well, assume that they might be stored there; then what would be the consequences?</text>
            <text syncTime="527.005" offset="2249495">The drawbacks of that are that inevitably that does lead to the disclosure of other information that is classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.777" offset="2284604">You sacrifice, Mr. Chief Justice, either the adequacy of the statement, or you sacrifice the information, because if you are going to have a statement which really calls to the attention of the decision makers what the real risks are here, you have to discuss things like, what kind of weapons will they be, what is their potential, and if there are to be environmental consequences, that depends on such things as the amount of fissionable material, the quality of the material, the security... the safeguards, the security, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.011" offset="2401528">Much better approach.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="566.246" offset="2406439">Wouldn't it be a military secret that a particular facility was capable of storage?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="573.050" stopTime="652.836">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="573.050" offset="2433711">That is not a secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.986" offset="2437368">The reason that it is not a secret is because the type of fencing that necessarily surrounds, necessarily accompanies a nuclear capable facility simply cannot be disguised.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.044" offset="2485642">But nuclear capability is not a secret; storage at a particular facility is.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.531" offset="2515631">That brings me to what I consider to be the principle that governs the resolution of this case, and it is a rather simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.136" offset="2550008">The key, as I say, is the existence of this Department of Defense regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.973" offset="2573309">If there is in fact no nuclear storage at West Loch, then the fears posited by the Respondents are, of course, groundless.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.698" offset="2616254">If, on the other hand, West Loch is or is to be a nuclear storage facility, then consistent with Department of Defense regulations, the environmental consequences have been called to the attention of the decision maker, and they have been taken into account by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.928" offset="2701205">The only problem is that that fact, whether or not the appropriate NEPA document has been prepared and has been called to the attention of the decision makers, is the very fact that cannot be disclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.062" offset="3033691">It is that disclosure to the public has the same limitation as does disclosure under the Freedom of information Act, and it is my understanding that the purposes of filing it with the Council on Environmental Quality is for purposes of public disclosure, but what does happen... excuse me.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.280" offset="3262628">--I am not enough of an expert on those kinds of matters to know whether it would satisfy it or not, but that question once again, I think, contains the key to the solution of this case for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.742" offset="3324486">I can make an argument that that generic statement, concluding, as it does, that there are no substantial risks from nuclear storage per se, together with the environmental impact assessment that was done pertaining to this particular facility, would be sufficient, but it is neither my background nor my training to know about the sufficiency of the totality of environmental document performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.277" offset="3450605">But those who are directing these kinds of matters, whose stewardship those kinds of matters fall within, do have that within their sphere of expertise, and in the event that the conclusion... that there is a conclusion that these are not sufficient, then the regulations require that additional documents be prepared and filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.678" offset="3560215">And NEPA really requires no more, and this, I think, is a crucial point.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.534" offset="3595637">With regard to environmental considerations being taken into effect, they are, the regulations required, and with respect to public disclosure, NEPA expressly exempts from public dissemination, through its incorporation by reference of the public disclosure provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the dissemination of classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.286" offset="3702635">Really, this also answers the motivating concerns of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.671" offset="3724160">The Court of Appeals' very proper concern, which led to what we conclude was clearly an improper kind of approach, was that the public has to receive some assurance that when the decision is made, the decision maker will have been adequately informed as to the environmental consequences of each alternative, and the Department of Defense regulations give that assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.056" offset="3825724">The Respondents contend that there is no difference between asking the hypothetical question, well, what would be the possible environmental consequences if a freeway exchange were built in a particular location, and a hypothetical which asks, what would be the possible environmental consequences if nuclear capable storage bunkers were built in a particular location.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.820" offset="3912764">Well, the question whether nuclear capable storage bunkers are built is not the question that poses the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.889" offset="3940976">It is whether in fact those nuclear capable facilities do have nuclear warheads stored within them, but the real difference--</text>

            <text syncTime="977.107" offset="4049854">There is a duty, but the point is that the Department of Defense regulations simply state that to whatever extent NEPA is applicable, it is not rendered inapplicable because of the presence of classified information, of secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.187" offset="4122266">The obvious difference between a hypothetical discussion of what would happen if nuclear weapons were stored in a particular site and what would happen if a highway were built in a particular place is that whether a highway does or does not exist in a particular location is not a military secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.399" offset="4195095">It may well be that the real complaint, and a complaint raised in a different form, a perfectly legitimate one, is whether that kind of information really should be secret or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.789" offset="4240653">I am sure that lively debate could be generated on that issue, but it is totally beside the point, because the ultimate right of decision on that issue is vested with those who have the responsibility over the safeguarding of nuclear secrets, and those same people have assured that NEPA applies even where classified information is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.172" offset="4342112">One means of safeguarding, preventing intrusion into governmental secrets in lawsuits that by their nature present the potential for intrusion into military secrets, is for the courts simply not to entertain those lawsuits at all, and there is a precedent coming out of this Court that holds that such suits are not justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.591" offset="4459872">It is a century old, Totten versus the United States, dealing with a suit by a spy allegedly hired by President Lincoln to spy during the Civil War, and this Court held that that kind of suit is not justiciable, the rationale being that public policy forbids the maintenance of any suit the trial of which would inevitably lead to disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.145" offset="4582021">Totten is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.431" offset="4595187">It was cited with approval in United States versus Reynolds, and it has been relied upon as the source of two holdings coming out of the Court of Claims within just recent months, and it would be dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.207" offset="4662269">Fortunately, however, the Court need not resolve this case on the Totten ground, and the reason, once again, is that the Department of Defense regulations make available another procedure that permits this information to remain secret.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.522" offset="6199523">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before this Court can be simply put: Is it lawful under the National Environmental Policy Act for the Navy to propose to build nuclear capable weapons storage bunkers in close proximity to three airports without ever examining the various possible consequences of that proposed action, particularly where one such consequence could be an airplane crash which could lead to an accidental explosion which would render downtown Honolulu or its fast growing suburbs uninhabitable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.964" offset="6345286">The question is not, as Petitioners have suggested, either whether or not nuclear weapons are presently in the West Loch bunkers; it is also not, as Petitioners have also suggested, whether or not NEPA requires revelation of military secrets in a publicly available EIS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.810" offset="6436715">Recently in their reply brief, and again here today, the Petitioners have suggested something else, which is that they have in fact complied with NEPA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.364" offset="9034958">Of course, the other questions that still remain in this case, and ones that the Court of Appeals remanded, were consideration of that EIS in relationship to the National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act, so that it is possible that there might be a conclusion that the Navy was putting the weapons into those bunkers in violation of one of those two other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.665" offset="9144150">But of course that is not the question here since we don't have an environmental impact statement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.021" offset="9173511">With respect to that point, I might only say that in the Court of Appeals, the Navy did suggest that they had met the requirements of NEPA by having prepared this environmental impact assessment, which really only discusses considerations relating to conventional weapons, for example, explosive safety zones and such, and by doing their candidate environmental impact statement, which is a very superficial, general discussion of questions relating to the storage of nuclear weapons, but the Court of Appeals specifically ruled that that EIA, the environmental impact assessment, and the CEIS, the candidate environmental impact statement, were not adequate to meet the requirements of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.204" offset="9374236">I might only point out one of the features of the candidate environmental impact statement, which was supposedly the general examination of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.476" offset="9411330">In that statement, they made the assertion that plutonium, which, of course, we know is one of the most deadly substances, would not be harmful if it was kept outside of the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.331" offset="9454798">However, they did not explore how one in fact could keep it out of the body, how an entire population could keep from breathing it in if there were an airplane crash that created a fire and explosion and plutonium dispersed throughout the island.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.570" offset="11343765">First, I would suggest, if there is... either if it has been ordered or if it is exists and it is classified, that it be remanded to the Trial Court and that there be an examination made in a similar fashion to other classified cases where perhaps the attorneys be given security clearances and be able to litigate before the Court whether or not it is an adequate EIS and whether or not in fact everything in that EIS need in fact be classified, because there is significant unclassified information, clearly unclassified information that can be considered publicly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.196" offset="11498200">For example, merely the kind of an arc that one can draw around an airport to determine the likelihood of a crash in a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.865" offset="11528920">In our record, it indicates that both the state and the city governments in Honolulu and Hawaii feel that such an arc should be drawn, but it has never been drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.740" offset="11572388">So, we don't know the likelihood of a crash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.423" offset="11579180">That is clearly not classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.392" offset="11587017">Additionally, the government is trying to suggest whether they have even done one is classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.379" offset="11610945">Well, of course, as we have already stated, the question of whether a bunker is nuclear capable is not classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.450" offset="11639262">Therefore, it need not be classified whether they have done one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.104" offset="11657861">Therefore, what we have should be a document which might be partially classified and partially declassified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.940" offset="11689208">The classified portions are in classified annexes, just as the Navy's regulations suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.029" offset="11717629">And, of course, now is premature to determine which points should be classified and which declassified, but such questions, as I said, as the likelihood of an airplane crash, general discussion of plutonium dispersal, which has on previous occasions been studied by scientists, those factors can be considered and discussed in a public EIS.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.812" offset="11812715">Let me finally, however, just refer to the Atomic Energy Act question which has been raised by the government, because we feel that, too, is a spurious question.</text>
