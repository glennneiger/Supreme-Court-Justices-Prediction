            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="114712">We will hear arguments now in Marine Bank against Samuel Weaver et ux.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.935" offset="150448">Mr. Miller, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_l_r_miller" startTime="11.435" stopTime="194.016">
            <label>Mr. Daniel L. R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="11.435" offset="160374">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.931" offset="194333">This case involves two separate and distinct instruments: one, an FDIC-insured certificate of deposit in the amount of $50,000 bearing interest at 7 1/2 percent and maturing in six years; secondly, an agreement between a loan customer of the bank and a guarantor of the customer's loan to the bank about which the bank had no knowledge at the time the loan was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.030" offset="290777">Petitioner Marine Bank requests that the Court reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court which found that both instruments were securities within the meaning of the definitions of the '33 and '34 Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.884" offset="342186">The FDIC-insured certificate of deposit is not specifically mentioned as an enumerated item in the '33 and '34 Act definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.379" offset="388162">However, the Circuit Court of Appeals applied several tests: one, the "any note" test: and secondly, whether it was an investment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.235" offset="431630">In the investment contract issue, the Howey case decided by this Court clearly establishes what the test is and has been since 1946, and that test was further elaborated upon by this Court in the Tcherepnin case cited a few years later; and that test being a document is a security if it's a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests money in a common enterprise with the profits to come solely from the efforts of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.158" offset="555241">We believe that that test has been misapplied by the Circuit Court, and there are three Circuit Court decisions, in the Fourth, Fifth and Seven Circuits: the Burrus case in the Fourth, the Bellah case in the Fifth, and the Fingland case in the Seventh, which hold that certificates of deposit are not securities within the meaning of those cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.853" offset="646043">Is it any note?</text>
            <text syncTime="136.242" offset="659626">The statutes say unless the context otherwise requires any note and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.364" offset="688152">Is the CD any note?</text>
            <text syncTime="145.534" offset="696825">In this event we'd like you to address the matter the way you did in the Daniel case which looked at the substance of the transaction and not what it is called.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.547" offset="740815">If you look at the substance in Daniel, as you did, you found that a pension plan document did not establish a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.309" offset="775923">Now, the Third Circuit here said that this was functionally the equivalent of a corporate note.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.321" offset="799956">We don't believe that that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.837" offset="809987">A corporate note contains an earnings risk and a risk of repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.709" offset="841543">This FDIC-secured certificate of deposit does not have a payment or repayment risk being an insured deposit, and it has a fixed rate of interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.204" offset="1039447">I believe the Third Circuit erred in its analogy calling this an investment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.825" offset="1073928">The Tcherepnin case held there was no voting... the fact of whether there is or is not a voting right connected with the instrument is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.258" offset="1115724">In Tcherepnin that was a savings and loan certificate which contained the element of voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.507" offset="1132652">The CD contains no element of voting.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="257.178" offset="1143414">Well, are you saying that in Tcherepnin the thing was more like a share of capital stock?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel L. R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="265.018" offset="1174761">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.628" offset="1177164">It was more like an investment in a savings and loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.298" offset="1183852">The savings and loan had no other investment vehicle other than selling shares or investment certificates as they were called in Tcherepnin.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.279" offset="1215825">But in this case the bank has, of course, capital stock issued pursuant to the Pennsylvania banking laws, which is where the investment would be in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="284.556" stopTime="286.415">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="284.556" offset="1252919">And you don't question that would be a security.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_l_r_miller" startTime="286.415" stopTime="398.668">
            <label>Mr. Daniel L. R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="286.415" offset="1260338">That certainly is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.696" offset="1265458">The legislative history of the enactment of the '33, I believe, and '34 Acts, in the congressional hearings one of the representatives of the banking industry clearly said that the stock of a national bank would be an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.175" offset="1323345">In looking at this you might think of it as to whether it's a commercial instrument or an investment instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.718" offset="1365559">We believe that commercial instruments are not covered by the securities definitions and investment instruments are.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.479" offset="1396593">Legislatively, the '33 and '34 Acts were part of a package of acts that were enacted in those years and which regulated banking in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.800" offset="1465870">One was the Glass-Steagall Act and another was the FDIC Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.909" offset="1482274">Now, those acts provided a parallel system of regulation of banking in this country, that is to say, federally regulated banking institutions, through the FDIC or the comptroller of the currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.278" offset="1539744">The legislative history of the Glass-Steagall Act shows that there was an attempt when it was passed to separate banking from investment activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.664" offset="1573285">And the Third Circuit, we believe, erred in blurring that distinction and putting it back together again.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.506" offset="1596691">The Respondent Weaver does have a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.099" offset="1607035">The Pennsylvania Securities Act, as referenced in the complaint of the Respondent filed in the District Court, does claim account under the Pennsylvania Securities Act where there is essentially the same language as rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.452" offset="1672446">Also, there is a Pennsylvania common law fraud count alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.685" offset="1689373">Both of those are pendant claims, and so there is a state court remedy in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.503" offset="1788639">I wouldn't express an opinion on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.001" offset="1798670">There probably is a question on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.470" offset="1804521">Is the Piccirillo agreement an investment contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="430.482" offset="1836599">I think there are four elements of investment contract that need to be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.090" offset="1863035">One, is there a multiple investor situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="443.274" offset="1887799">There is none here.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.274" offset="1879754">Is there a pooling of funds?</text>
            <text syncTime="444.835" offset="1893964">Was there a public offering?</text>
            <text syncTime="446.959" offset="1902532">None here.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.303" offset="1907861">Was it solely from the efforts of the promoter Piccirillo?</text>
            <text syncTime="452.410" offset="1924266">No, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.676" offset="1933357">This agreement provided that Mr. Weaver could pasture his cows and use the barn of Mr. Piccirillo.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.360" offset="1960106">And secondly, and very most importantly, he could veto any future loans in Mr. Piccirillo's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.578" offset="1981004">So it was not solely from the efforts of the promoter Piccirillo.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.825" offset="1997932">Even if... and don't admit that it is... but even if this Piccirillo agreement is a security, the bank had no knowledge of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.631" offset="2061148">The depositions of both Mr. Weaver and Mrs. Weaver, reproduced in the Joint Appendix and quoted in most of the briefs, clearly established that they did not tell Marine Bank of the existence of this side agreement between them: and Marine Bank therefore cannot be held under the Ernst and Ernst case decided in this Court as an aider and abettor in the securities fraud which has been alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.090" offset="2166996">We can't predicate 10b-5 liability on the alleged negligence of failure to inquire about something we didn't know was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.929" offset="2202418">The closest case in the Circuit Court is in the Fifth Circuit, a case of Woodward v. Metro Bank cited about five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.566" offset="2232929">Whether a CD or the Piccirillo agreement is or is not a security is a matter of law and not of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.032" offset="2274830">The Circuit Court erred in reversing the judgment of the District Court in remanding for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.248" offset="2295623">A motion for summary judgment was and is the proper method to resolve the issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.528" offset="2316730">The broad security definition cited by Judge Gibbons at the conclusion of the Third Circuit opinion is clearly in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.384" offset="2356227">The SEC agrees, as do the other regulatory authorities, as to the result in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.333" offset="2375976">Under the analysis of Howey, Tcherepnin and Daniel cases in this Court, these two instruments are not securities and cannot be the basis of 10b-5 liability or a 10b-5 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.016" offset="2430728">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.982" offset="2466568">Good morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.871" offset="2474196">To understand this case, the posture of this case, is to understand some of the factual background.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.009" offset="2498647">I think simply stated, Sam and Alice Weaver go to the bank at the bank's request in early March of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.035" offset="2546816">They have acquired a $50,000 certificate of deposit a couple weeks ago prior to them going into the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.001" offset="2574715">They've already been solicited to make an investment in the Columbus business by the bank, and in early March of 1978 they in effect traded the certificate of deposit, the $50,000 certificate of deposit they had, which was of a maturity of six years, which you undoubtedly understand is critical because it gets it outside the exception within the '34 or the '33 Act that has the nine month exclusion, and they traded that for this particular agreement, that is, an investment position in the Columbus business.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.939" offset="2722464">All of these events occurred within a couple days of each other or a couple weeks of each other, and one was the consideration for the other; in other words, they trade their certificate of deposit for the right to obtain the profits from Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.824" offset="2781919">A critical thing here in the bank's involvement is that the bank induced this transaction for their own benefit, and the reason why it was to their own benefit is that they in effect were a risk lender to Columbus and unprotected at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.974" offset="2854539">And the reason why they were unprotected is they forgot to file their equipment liens properly in the right county; so in effect they had a $30,000 or $40,000 loan outstanding that they couldn't collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.356" offset="2916083">Columbus is insolvent at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.356" offset="2924129">Columbus is overdrawn at this bank in the checking account; in other words, there is a checking account and they're overdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.291" offset="2951819">I think the record indicates way back in '77 that they had been overdrawn; they had been overdrawn continuously.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.038" offset="2982852">The bank kept on honoring their checks to keep them afloat, if you will, to keep Columbus afloat so that they could stay in business, so that they could figure out a remedy to this problem, because the bank couldn't collect on their loans because they hadn't perfected their equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.766" offset="3041680">So as a consequence of that, they had told Columbus, Mr. Piccirillo, to go get an investor, and they introduced... that is, Mr. Piccirillo introduced Mr. Weaver to the bank because the bank in effect was approving whoever was going to get in business with Mr. Piccirillo, and Mr. Weaver in February of 1978 refused to get involved in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.132" offset="3135199">He refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.773" offset="3137706">He said it was too risky; he didn't know Columbus financial status.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.788" offset="3153798">So what happened was then the bank, realizing that Mr. Weaver was going to be the way that they could enhance their position, that is, that they could get their overdrawn checking account solved and get the loans taken care of, went out and actively went after Mr. Weaver to get involved in Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.466" offset="3244495">And they solicited him out at his farm, and they finally persuaded him to come in with his certificate of deposit and pledge it; and they told his that if he pledged the certificate of deposit, they would loan Columbus $65,000, and all or substantially all the $65,000 would go for working capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.410" offset="3328296">This was perceived by Mr. Weaver to be a safe investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.862" offset="3342088">It was perceived by Mr. Weaver to be safe for many reasons, one of which was the fact that the bank told Mr. Weaver that in fact the bank had filed proper liens against Columbus' equipment, and they were protected, and they had sufficient collateral to protect Mr. Weaver.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.823" offset="3413977">Those three statements, affirmative statements by the bank were false.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.963" offset="3430487">They weren't going to lend Columbus $65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.554" offset="3444906">They were going to take the $65,000, just as they did in this case, and pay themselves off, leaving little or no money for Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.426" offset="3480328">And the second and third statements were false, that is, that they had perfected liens, Because they filed them in the wrong county.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.893" offset="3510212">It's a quirk here.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.548" offset="3516900">Columbus is right on the county line between Erie County and Warren County, and the bank's main office is in Erie County; and in any case they filed the equipment liens in the wrong county so they were unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.464" offset="3564547">That was false, and the third statement was false, the third representation, that there was sufficient assets there that if anything went wrong with the loan that Weaver would collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.381" offset="3612194">Now, perceiving that to be a safe investment and a safe transaction, that's what Mr. Weaver in effect did.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.864" offset="3638108">He came in, he pledged it, and a couple days prior to that he had agreed to take this profit-sharing agreement with Columbus.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.063" offset="3674888">Now, you've got to understand the fact that there is absolutely no question we're here under a rule 56 action for summary judgment, and the facts are to be construed favorably to the Weavers.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.901" offset="3718252">The Weavers are elderly people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2055.607" offset="8337119">You're getting closer to that particular case, and I'm sure that you can draw arrangements that get closer to this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.713" offset="8377556">And I think that we meet all of the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.554" offset="8392916">The Court said they were not dealing with a full record in this particular case, and the question before the Third Circuit was not whether or not after a full trial whether or not we had met the full definitions of an investment contract or a profit-sharing agreement or a certificate of interest, if you will, but whether or not there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether or not we met those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.030" offset="8482777">And we would submit that on the record before that court and on the record before this Court there's certainly an issue of fact.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2101.713" offset="8521543">Well, are you saying that to make the investment contract aspect of this case a security you must have as a part of the overall transaction a pledge of the certificate of deposit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_conner" startTime="2109.398" stopTime="2183.508">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Conner</label>
            <text syncTime="2109.398" offset="8552263">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.912" offset="8562294">See, the original idea of this whole transaction was Mr. Weaver was just going to give Piccirillo $50,000, and then he backed off because of the risk involved, and the bank became concerned and went back and told, well, listen, there is a less riskier way of doing this; you give us the $50,000 CD, we will loan the business $65,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.871" offset="8658111">And the bank was doing that, you see, because that was the only way at that point that they could solve their own problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.149" offset="8687264">And from Weaver's standpoint it seemed like a relatively safe investment, because he sees somebody who he trusts, the bank, and they're telling him that they have the equipment protected, that they're going to give him $65,000, and the bank themselves said that Piccirillo needed $10,000 to make it, and the bank knew that he wasn't going to get $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.780" offset="8793739">He got $3,800 out of a $65,000 loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.902" offset="8806278">Now, there was just no possible way that Columbus was going to make it; that they were headed for insolvency or bankruptcy irrespective of this loan transaction.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2183.508" offset="8848701">Well, if the bank had made misrepresentations about this company and convinced the people to make a loan directly to the company, same result?</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.190" offset="8899378">Say you took back a note from the company.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_conner" startTime="2199.017" stopTime="2216.088">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Conner</label>
            <text syncTime="2199.017" offset="8910768">Certainly the courts have held that risky loans, a long-term loan at risk is a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.780" offset="8937830">The Second Circuit specifically, I believe in the Zeller case that's made reference to in the briefs, has indicated that long-term loans like that are securities.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2216.088" stopTime="2220.836">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2216.088" offset="8978999">So any note issued by a borrower may be a security?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_conner" startTime="2220.836" stopTime="2366.059">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Conner</label>
            <text syncTime="2220.836" offset="8998016">No, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.602" offset="9001047">I didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.366" offset="9004077">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.725" offset="9005540">It's a loan that's at risk where the only chance of paying it back is a profit situation, and that was the only chance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.222" offset="9051515">The only chance that Weaver was going to get his certificate of deposit back is in fact if Columbus somehow was going to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.844" offset="9078056">And so we would submit that whether you call it an investment contract or whether you call it a profit-sharing agreement or a certificate of interest, that there is at least under rule 56 a factual issue that would allow a court or jury to make a conclusion that investment contracts or one of these other subspecies in fact exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.425" offset="9196338">And I think that the arguments about their not being a common enterprise are not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.267" offset="9215773">There was in fact a pooling of assets, a true pooling of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.313" offset="9235940">There was no specific segregation of Weaver's investment from Mr. Piccirillo's investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.575" offset="9268959">And certainly the third element is made, would be satisfied in a full trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.977" offset="9302604">We would submit that the Third Circuit is correct, that there are factual support for our position that the Piccirillo agreement is a profit-sharing agreement or a certificate of interest or investment contract; that in this particular case the Third Circuit is also correct that the certificate of deposit in this secondary transaction was made by an investor for investment purposes, that it was in fact a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.028" offset="9418797">This particular court held in the Rubin case that even though it was a loan transaction, the person got convicted under section 17 when they made a pledge, and that was just as much a commercial loan as this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.242" offset="9479610">And if it applies in a criminal case, then it certainly would apply in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.974" offset="9494552">And we would submit that the Third Circuit was correct in directing the District Court to remand the case to hear the pendant state court claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.236" offset="9539587">And we would submit that under Rosado v. Wyman that that would be the outcome no matter what this particular Court would decide on the federal securities questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.152" offset="9575218">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.507" offset="9628717">I'll say that there are a series of cases, the note and mortgage cases, and all of them in the circuit courts have decided generally that a note and mortgage situation referenced by Justice Powell and Justice Stevens were not securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.860" offset="9694128">In response to one of the questions concerning the existence of the state court action, it is my clear understanding that the cases were filed in the state court on a timely basis but were not served on Marine Bank on a timely basis, and therefore, they are out of time as far as state court action goes.</text>
