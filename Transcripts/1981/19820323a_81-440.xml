            <text syncTime="12.933" offset="183250">Mr. Trent, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edmund K. Trent</label>
            <text syncTime="121.107" offset="615943">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="124.371" offset="629004">This case comes before this Court on a cross-petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, brought by the Appellants there, Defendants in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.631" offset="690026">The pleading in suit was the second count of the complaint by the Plaintiff, the Compagnie des Bauxite de Guinee, a non-Pennsylvania corporation, against a number of Defendants, including the 14 Cross-Petitioners, non-Pennsylvania insurance companies... Indeed, they were non-American insurance companies... on contracts of insurance made in London insuring a risk in Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.727" offset="826385">The Defendants pleaded lack of personal jurisdiction and filed a motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.879" offset="867032">The Plaintiff requested the Defendants to produce their insurance policies covering Pennsylvania insureds, Pennsylvania risks, and emanating from brokers in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.997" offset="931502">At the hearing before the district judge on the motion to dismiss and on the Defendants' objections to the request for documents, the counsel for the Defendant insurers, two young people from New York at the time, pointed out to the court that the Defendants did not have copies of their policies in their possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.250" offset="1044455">The contracts of insurance consisted of for the most part each contract a single piece of paper called a placing slip, where the terms of the risk were summarized in shorthand form, abbreviated form, in accordance with the practice in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.306" offset="1124704">And so then the district court said, well... oh... the Defendants' counsel said: These are in the hands of about 150 brokers in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.833" offset="1166813">According to British practice, the broker is not the agent of the insurance company, but the agent of the insured or the prospective insured seeking insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.046" offset="1215610">And so the district judge said, request them from the brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.029" offset="1235567">New York counsel for the insurers went to England to see what he could find out about these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.791" offset="1278617">In effect, he undertook to do what the court had ordered him to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.788" offset="1290633">And he found there that there were about four million files involved in these policies, because the insurers did not have indexes relating to Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.454" offset="1349252">Their indexes were based on large geographical areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.984" offset="1367433">The continent of North America was the smallest group that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.280" offset="1384570">And so he came back and, within the time allowed by the court as extended for 30 days, he filed an affidavit offering to produce all the Defendants' own records, these placing slips, at their places where they were kept in England, mostly in London, and for one of the Defendants in Tel Aviv, where its records were kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.065" offset="1491776">At the hearing... oh, the Plaintiff then filed a motion to compel, and at the hearing on that motion the district judge said, I'll give you another 60 days to get these policies from the brokers.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="354.358" offset="1548932">Did the district court at that time, Mr. Trent, say where the production should take place?</text>

            <text syncTime="363.838" offset="1586862">But the request for documents asked for them to be brought to the office of Plaintiff's counsel in Pittsburgh, and it was assumed that that's where they were to be produced.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="375.691" offset="1634196">Is that disputed at all or does everybody agree?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edmund K. Trent</label>
            <text syncTime="378.503" offset="1645481">I think everyone agrees on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.003" offset="1651437">There was no specific statement by the court that they should be produced in Pittsburgh, but everyone assumed it because the request for documents said to produce them at the office of Plaintiff's counsel in Pittsburgh.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="392.685" offset="1702219">Counsel, insofar as I was able to determine reading the briefs, the Defendants at trial indicated that that would basically be possible; it was a question of when, not if.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.444" offset="1753210">Is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_k_trent" startTime="406.054" stopTime="432.090">
            <label>Mr. Edmund K. Trent</label>
            <text syncTime="406.054" offset="1755717">To produce in Pittsburgh, you mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="407.444" offset="1761255">Well, it would be possible, yes, to bring 4,000, four million files to Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.488" offset="1789468">But as a practical matter I would say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.925" offset="1799185">I question even whether Hercules could do such a thing, and we have no one of his caliber on our staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.219" offset="1828338">As a practical matter, it was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.514" offset="1841504">When--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="432.090" stopTime="438.135">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="432.090" offset="1859789">And that position was articulated at all times before the district court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_k_trent" startTime="438.135" stopTime="440.416">
            <label>Mr. Edmund K. Trent</label>
            <text syncTime="438.135" offset="1884031">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.963" offset="1891345">It was not--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="440.416" stopTime="442.399">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="440.416" offset="1893121">That it was impossible physically?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_k_trent" startTime="442.399" stopTime="617.626">
            <label>Mr. Edmund K. Trent</label>
            <text syncTime="442.399" offset="1901063">--Well, I can't say that it was expressly said, but it would seem to me that it's just obvious that you can't bring four million files across the ocean as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.003" offset="1951531">And that was the position that we took.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.486" offset="1965428">Now, then the district court gave the Defendants another 60 days to get the policies from the brokers in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.481" offset="2013389">The Defendants then sent letters to roughly 150 brokers, and the brokers answered that it was impossible for them to get these policies out of their files or that it was impossible to do it within the time limit, which was a little less than 60 days by the time they got the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.846" offset="2106908">So that there they were taking the definite position that it was impossible because their files too were not indexed according to the states in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.155" offset="2148077">After that the Plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions to have the court find that the Defendants were subject to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.337" offset="2212860">While that motion was pending, the Defendants, based on some newly discovered evidence which they had received a few months before, filed an action in London for a declaratory judgment that they had the right to avoid, as the British term is, to rescind the contract, because of the failure of the Plaintiff to disclose material information at the time they asked the Defendants to assume the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.262" offset="2324560">The Plaintiff then filed a motion to enjoin that London action, and at the hearing on the preliminary injunction the district court entered a sanction, finding the Defendants subject to jurisdiction and entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the action in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.049" offset="2423721">About two months later, on the Plaintiff's motion he entered orders saying that the jurisdictional finding is conclusive, there shall be no discovery on jurisdiction and no testimony on it at the permanent injunction hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.308" offset="2492684">Then on appeal to the Court of Appeals, the Third Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Aldisert, reversed the injunction, but affirmed on the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.878" offset="2554960">Plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari on the injunction, which is still pending, and the Defendants filed a cross-petition on the jurisdiction, which Your Honors granted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="617.626" stopTime="628.824">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="617.626" offset="2601980">Mr. Trent, before you get into your argument could I ask just perhaps kind of a stupid question?</text>
            <text syncTime="623.295" offset="2624655">What is the position of these British insurance companies as to where they should properly be sued?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_k_trent" startTime="628.824" stopTime="634.838">
            <label>Mr. Edmund K. Trent</label>
            <text syncTime="628.824" offset="2646806">Where they should be sued?</text>
            <text syncTime="631.417" offset="2657151">In London.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.214" offset="2660286">The custom over there is that if--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="634.838" stopTime="641.537">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="634.838" offset="2670839">That if an American company enters into an insurance... gets insurance from an English company, they're expected to sue in London?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_k_trent" startTime="641.537" stopTime="650.048">
            <label>Mr. Edmund K. Trent</label>
            <text syncTime="641.537" offset="2697588">--Yes, because the way that the insurance is placed, it's the broker in London who makes the contract with the insurer there.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="650.048" stopTime="653.344">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="650.048" offset="2731652">And they wouldn't even have been subject to suit in West Africa, either?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_k_trent" startTime="653.344" stopTime="777.812">
            <label>Mr. Edmund K. Trent</label>
            <text syncTime="653.344" offset="2744818">No, unless it's stated on the placing slip, it's assumed that it will be in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.515" offset="2765507">Now, in the present case the insurers, the underwriters who accepted the contract for the insurers thought that this was a Guinean company in Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.979" offset="2807407">They had no knowledge at all that the Plaintiff was a Delaware corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.461" offset="2829350">Its name being in French and French being the language in the Republic of Guinea, they thought it was a Guinean risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.348" offset="2864877">As a matter of fact, the testimony was they thought they were reinsuring a Guinean company, because many of the countries there have preference for their own insurance companies and the London companies then reinsure them.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.311" offset="2912733">The Court of Appeals in... well, I should say that the question is then whether the sanction was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.431" offset="2977203">The Court of Appeals held that it... no.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.257" offset="3004475">And we say that depends on two things, whether a court can make a sanction, make an order requiring discovery and impose a sanction for not obeying before the court has found the Defendants subject to personal jurisdiction; and second, that the order in this case, the sanction order, is valid only if the discovery order is valid, and a discovery order requiring us to bring four million files from London to Pittsburgh is a complete abuse of discretion, it's impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.944" offset="3159224">The Defendants could not comply with it and therefore they didn't willfully disobey it.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.254" offset="3184511">It was just impossible to obey.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.863" offset="3190885">And there's not a shred of evidence in the record that the young New York lawyers who were handling the matter were contumacious in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.485" offset="3225366">They were trying to do what the court wanted them to do, and when they--</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.569" offset="5361765">After all, when the insurance company writes insurance and signs a policy and the broker keeps it, the insurance company has a right to get that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.315" offset="5396769">But the general rule in the law is that if a party which has control of another's documents, a non-party to the action has control of the documents of a party and the party says, please give them to me, and the person with custody says, no, I won't, then it's up to the other party to the case who wants them to go after that party who has the custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.926" offset="7083130">Well, Your Honor, obviously I was trying to prove jurisdiction on one of several grounds, and the Defendants were contending that they didn't do enough business here... or in Pennsylvania... to be subject to suit there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.857" offset="7162855">And it seemed to me that when they're coming into court and asking the court to make a binding determination of no jurisdiction on the ground that they don't have sufficient contacts in Pennsylvania to satisfy the tests under International Shoe, that by doing so they've at least agreed to produce or consented to the jurisdiction of the court to produce those facts which are relevant to that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.906" offset="7291064">Otherwise it seems to me, Your Honors, it's a complete abuse of our judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.638" offset="7318023">Furthermore, there is evidence in the record, contrary to what Mr. Trent says, that the excess insurers knew that INA was the company that had written the primary insurance, that they knew of the contact with Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.833" offset="7386777">We have affidavits from the brokers, we have testimony on depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.300" offset="7408720">The excess layer was $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.595" offset="7425856">40 percent of that was reinsured with INA Reinsurance in Brussels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.030" offset="7455636">The same London broker who the excess insurers would have this Court believe for all purposes is the agent of my client, at the same time they were negotiating the excess layer of coverage, they were also negotiating the reinsurance, not for my clients but for the excess insurers, with INA Reinsurance in Brussels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.955" offset="7567335">That company took 40 percent of this excess layer of $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.610" offset="7585935">That company is an affiliated company with the primary carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.732" offset="7606415">That company had full information in its files, furnished by the broker, concerning CBG, its U.S. connection, the fact it was a Delaware corporation, who its owners were, completely consistent with the affidavit of the London brokers as to what they had in their files and what was available for the excess insurers to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.364" offset="7704948">Now, if they gave it to the reinsurance company, I submit there is reason to believe it was also given to all of the excess insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.626" offset="7741938">There are a lot of other misstatements of fact which appear in the brief and which were repeated here again today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.621" offset="7781957">Now, the only way that I can explain it is that Mr. Trent came into this case some time after the sanctions were entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.289" offset="7824589">I've been in the case from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.880" offset="7839009">There was never a question at any time in any of the proceedings as to whether the documents had to be produced in Pittsburgh or in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.875" offset="7895015">There was never an objection made by the excess insurers on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.342" offset="7916854">I never refused to go to London to look at documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.606" offset="7933886">The court never really ordered them to produce them in Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.479" offset="7949350">As a matter of fact, as Mr. Trent should know, I went to London and to Europe, to Brussels, both before and after this offer that was made four months after they were ordered to produce the documents, to look at documents when the documents were produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.236" offset="8036390">What did happen here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.938" offset="8051228">A motion... after they filed the motion for summary judgment claiming no in personam jurisdiction because, they said, they didn't have sufficient contact... the fact is they had initially filed affidavits in connection with the motion for summary judgment in which all 17 denied any business in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.552" offset="8161673">But after we filed counter-affidavits establishing business to the extent that we were able to prove it, they filed new affidavits, in 13 of which these excess insurers acknowledge under oath that they are engaged in writing insurance and covering risks on a worldwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.668" offset="8250176">They don't exclude Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.792" offset="8258640">Pennsylvania is a rather commercial state, with a lot of industries that are engaged in business worldwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.241" offset="8296465">In some of these affidavits we find representations that they conducted... that they had reviewed some of their files and that they had determined that certain percentages, either one percent more or less, had been determined to be derived from Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.075" offset="8391760">Now, that's not just in a representation of counsel, as I understood Mr. Trent to indicate to the Court previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.321" offset="8428749">It is in signed, sworn affidavits of the excess insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.335" offset="8456857">Justice Stevens, I believe asked the question about, how did they know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.098" offset="8475874">Well, presumably, at least the representation made to the court was that the files had been reviewed to support the affidavit, not that they had some general understanding out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.983" offset="8531358">Now, it may be, and I submit should be, that one percent of their premium income, which in all probability runs into the millions of dollars, is enough contact with Pennsylvania to meet the test of International Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.240" offset="8620488">And when they... when we were in court and they asked whether that wasn't adequate, whether I wasn't satisfied with that, I said that if you are still contending that that extent of business does not meet the regularity test then I want you to produce the documents, as you were originally ordered to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.338" offset="8728844">And they said, what difference... the lawyer said, what difference does it make whether it's one or two percent?</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.398" offset="8753086">Well, I offered to withdraw the request for production of documents if they would acknowledge that the one or two percent of their business was sufficient to meet the tests of the Pennsylvania long arm statute and the requirement of International Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.295" offset="8840648">They were not willing to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.216" offset="8848380">They still contended that the contacts were not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.480" offset="8861441">Now, they were originally ordered to produce, on July 27th, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.774" offset="8890594">Mr. Trent would have you believe, and in fact says so in his brief and in his reply brief and intimated it again today, that the lawyers from New York, who are experienced insurance lawyers in the international insurance field, immediately went to London to contact the brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.373" offset="8992994">In fact, that's what he says in his brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.361" offset="9428926">Now, the problem is, at the July 27th, '78, hearing the counsel from New York told the court they'd have to contact brokers, there were 150 brokers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.728" offset="9506352">In fact, they had filed an affidavit earlier that day in which they said there'd be 150 brokers involved and it would require contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.864" offset="9538953">The judge suggested that a letter be written to the brokers, a form letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.878" offset="9562986">And there was no objection at that time that they were outside of the control of the excess insurers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.296" offset="9608648">Six months later, in January 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.949" offset="9635293">Even though at the July hearing their counsel is saying, the documents you want are in the hands of the brokers, they're not saying, however, that they're outside their control... and if I understood Mr. Trent today, he's now not suggesting that either, because I think clearly they are not outside the control of the excess insurers... instead of immediately going to London, as Mr. Trent indicates in his brief, and in his reply brief, and again today, they admitted five months later at the December hearing that they hadn't contacted even one broker, five months after they had been ordered to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.869" offset="13978934">So all he was doing was moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.696" offset="13998264">He did not invoke the jurisdiction of the court by saying it had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.489" offset="14025432">I think that's just a complete contradiction to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.270" offset="14040583">Now, one thing I think has not been clearly brought out here is to just what was being asked for in these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.311" offset="14084677">First, the request for documents asked for the policies, and then the court said at the hearing on that, we'll get up this list in a general way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.556" offset="14137654">And Mr. Mellott then said, I want to see the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.492" offset="14153432">And then counsel for the Defendants said that the brokers had the policies, and so mister... Judge Simmons said, well, write to the brokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.692" offset="14198258">So we understood that we were to get the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.298" offset="14216648">Then after New York counsel had gone to England to investigate the situation... and Mr. Mellott's correct, he didn't talk to the brokers, he talked to 15 of his clients, but they knew about the brokers and so forth... he came back and he made this affidavit... and there's not anything dilatory; he did it within the time... that it would involve four million files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.631" offset="14326049">Now, he was talking then about the insurers' own files, but they would show the same thing as the brokers' files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.753" offset="14358441">That is, the contract is the placing slip and the insurance company keeps that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.843" offset="14378816">The broker, as agent for the insured, then prepares a policy, gives it to the insured to sign and then takes it back and keeps a copy of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.262" offset="14420508">So the same information would be in the brokers' files as would be in the insurers' files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.556" offset="14441719">So New York counsel, Mr. Bruckmann, thought, well, let us offer our own files and we will make those available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.928" offset="14479231">They would show the same thing as the brokers' files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.333" offset="14492815">Now, Mr. Mellott says that we never did offer to produce the documents anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.109" offset="14543910">But after I got into the case, which was after the sanctions had been entered, I thought, well, let's see if we can get the... offer to produce them now and satisfy the court and be done with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.994" offset="14595424">And so I expressly offered to produce all these files in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.851" offset="14626875">And Mr. Mellott said, no, we're not interested in the files relating to jurisdiction now, and he prepared this order and he submitted it and the judge said he was going to sign it, barring us from ever contesting jurisdiction again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.359" offset="14696883">And I said, on the strength of that I offer to produce all these records in London on July 2nd, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.888" offset="14723006">That's right in the record.</text>
