            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="121376">We will hear arguments first this morning in Herweg against Ray.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.070" offset="149588">Mr. Dudovitz, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_s_dudovitz" startTime="13.308" stopTime="384.048">
            <label>Mr. Neal S. Dudovitz</label>
            <text syncTime="13.308" offset="174561">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the case before you today presents this Court with familiar concepts, a federal-state cooperative program, federal regulatory issues, and specific elements of the Medicaid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.102" offset="245719">Petitioners are a class of poor persons from the state of Iowa who are being deprived of Medicaid benefits for nursing home care solely because Iowa has chosen to disobey federal Medicaid regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.879" offset="308831">The heart of the Medicaid problem here involves a determination of the amount of money available to an institutionalized spouse from a non-institutionalized spouse in determining benefit eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.590" offset="371734">This process is called deeming, and of course it is the very same process confronted by this Court last term in its decision in Schweiker v. Gray Panthers.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.964" offset="417187">Whether or not deeming is employed for spouses separated by institutionalization of course often results in critical life decisions for members of the petitioner class.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.939" offset="469118">As a majority of this Court noted in Gray Panthers, many individuals in need of medical care are forced by deeming to choose between abandoning an institutionalized spouse and living in poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.699" offset="528155">This dilemma is at the core of the present controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="547381">This case, like that in Gray Panthers, revolves around the validity of the federal regulations that determine when a state such as Iowa may deem income between spouses separated by institutionalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.779" offset="612478">Contrary to the plaintiffs in Gray Panthers, petitioners in this case are not attacking the validity of the federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.301" offset="650512">Instead, it is the respondent Iowa who now claims, despite their acceptance of federal moneys, that they are not bound by the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.776" offset="696383">Iowa argues it may make its own deeming rules, directly contrary to the federal regulations, and still be reimbursed by the federal government for Medicaid payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.118" offset="749778">Petitioners maintain, on the other hand, that the federal regulations are a valid exercise of the Secretary's authority granted to him by Congress, and the federal government, as stated in their amicus brief filed herein, agrees with petitioners that Iowa's Medicaid rules must be changed in order to comply with the federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.151" offset="845908">The analysis which this Court must employ in evaluating this controversy was set forth by the Court in its decision last term in Gray Panthers.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.791" offset="896481">The regulations at issue in this case are promulgated under the exact same statutory authority for which the regulations of Gray Panthers were promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.349" offset="938695">In the Gray Panthers case, this Court ruled that the section of the Medicaid Act under which the Secretary was acting both in Gray Panthers and here amounted to Congress's granting to the Secretary the power to make regulations that have legislative effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.846" offset="1020720">The Court therefore applied its previous decision in Batterton v. Francis, in order to determine the validity of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.654" offset="1067949">The Batterton test requires that the regulations be upheld unless they are either arbitrary or capricious, or beyond the authority granted the Secretary by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.497" offset="1127299">It is important to note that neither the district court in this case nor Judge Ross writing for half of the Eighth Circuit followed the Batterton test.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.388" offset="1174842">The only group of judges that did was the second half of the Eighth Circuit, in an opinion written by Judge McMillian, who followed the Batterton test, and came out on the same side as petitioners are herein, indicating that the regulations must stand and Iowa's rules must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.968" offset="1261151">The practical implications of the Batterton-Gray Panther test are that this Court must focus on the reasonableness of the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.609" offset="1303783">It is not the duty of this Court to interpret the statute to see if there is another way to read the statutes, nor is it the duty of this Court under Batterton and Gray Panthers to compare Iowa's interpretation or the Secretary's to determine whose might seem most reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.654" offset="1379956">The question is not really whether Iowa's policy is reasonable, which is what Iowa seems to want to argue to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.843" offset="1416736">The only issue is whether the Secretary's regulations are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.045" offset="1433454">If they are, then they must stand, and Iowa must be forced to follow them.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.632" offset="1455815">The Gray Panthers decision is not, however, controlling on the ultimate merits of this case, for the reason that the regulations at stake in Gray Panthers ultimately did not apply to the state of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.208" offset="1514120">Under the statutory authority of the Medicaid Act that we are concerned with, the Secretary issued, in a sense, two sets of regulations, one that applied to states which have been called the 209(b) states, and another set of regulations that apply to the SSI states.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.003" offset="1585383">At stake in Gray Panthers were the regulations applicable to the 209(b) states, at stake here are the regulations applicable to the SSI states.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.859" offset="1624775">That distinction is what produces the critical difference in this case.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="384.048" offset="1657480">Mr. Dudovitz, did Mrs. Herweg's family apply on her behalf for SSI benefits before applying for Medicaid?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_s_dudovitz" startTime="392.118" stopTime="419.269">
            <label>Mr. Neal S. Dudovitz</label>
            <text syncTime="392.118" offset="1689768">The record reflects that she did not apply before, and I think the briefs will note that there is some question about whether or not she in fact ever was an SSI recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.224" offset="1734176">However, the Court will note that attached to the appendix in this case is the decision of the Iowa Department of Social Services on the Herwegs, and they note in that decision that as of June... they had received notice that as of June, 1977, she was going to receive SSI.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="419.269" stopTime="423.321">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="419.269" offset="1798437">Is there a reason why no application was made on her behalf?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_s_dudovitz" startTime="423.321" stopTime="617.945">
            <label>Mr. Neal S. Dudovitz</label>
            <text syncTime="423.321" offset="1814633">I actually do not know the answer to why she did not make an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.875" offset="1840860">It is my understanding that she would have been eligible after the first month that she moved out of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.897" offset="1868863">The difference between the 209(b) and SSI distinctions, as I said, is critical here.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.038" offset="1921526">The 209(b) option, as this Court noted in Gray Panthers, was created by Congress essentially at the behest of the states because the states did not want to be bound by what we have called the SSI link.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.285" offset="1998431">That link, that part of the statute, 1396(a)(10)(a), requires that a state provide Medicaid benefits to all SSI recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.544" offset="2063528">This link to categorical programs, that is, linking Medicaid eligibility to eligibility for categorical programs, was not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.102" offset="2109712">It has essentially existed in the Medicaid program from its inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.423" offset="2131028">The critical difference, though, that occurred in 1972 was the adoption by Congress of the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.696" offset="2164152">Prior to that time, the states were able to control many of the eligibility conditions for the categorical programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.151" offset="2197902">Therefore, to link eligibility to those programs did not... still allowed the states to have substantial control over the eligibility conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.740" offset="2240325">By federalizing the age, blind, and disabled in SSI, Congress created the eligibility conditions for supplemental security income.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.596" offset="2279717">That would have resulted in some states, if the link had been continued to apply to them, having to pay Medicaid benefits to people they had not paid them to before.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.237" offset="2322245">In order to not force the states to have to do this, Congress provided the 209(b) option, which allowed states to use its eligibility conditions that were in existence in January, 1972, rather than be bound by the SSI rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.846" offset="2392671">States had a voluntary choice to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.733" offset="2412210">Iowa chose to be bound by the SSI rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.554" offset="2439587">Iowa chose to follow the SSI rules for Medicaid eligibility, as, of course, did a majority of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.945" offset="2477098">It is important to remember that the link then assures that all SSI people, all people who are so poor that they need cash assistance, will also get corresponding medical benefits, and it attaches to Medicaid the eligibility conditions for those benefits that Congress crafted in the SSI statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="617.945" stopTime="649.233">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="617.945" offset="2593082">Mr. Dudovitz, may I ask you a question, which is, if we were to reverse in this case, and give effect to the Secretary's regulation, would states still be able to collect money from the spouse who is not institutionalized for reimbursement to the state under some state relative responsibility law, in your view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_s_dudovitz" startTime="649.233" stopTime="665.362">
            <label>Mr. Neal S. Dudovitz</label>
            <text syncTime="649.233" offset="2718261">Yes, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.183" offset="2722023">The Medicaid rules here and the SSI rules say nothing about the state's powers under its relative responsibility laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.589" offset="2751698">In fact, the Secretary has noted a number of times that the states are free to exercise their rights, whatever they may be, under those laws.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="665.362" stopTime="667.712">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="665.362" offset="2782731">Does Iowa have such a law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_s_dudovitz" startTime="667.712" stopTime="823.397">
            <label>Mr. Neal S. Dudovitz</label>
            <text syncTime="667.712" offset="2792135">It is my understanding Iowa does have such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.897" offset="2800912">The particular SSI eligibility rules that are being brought to the Medicaid program through the link here, the deeming rules, are simply that spouses when they live together must have their income included together, and when only one spouse is an eligible spouse, there is only one spouse is applying for benefits, that deeming must cease after the first month.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.785" offset="2924419">When two spouses are applying, SSI requires that their income be considered together for six months, and correspondingly, the Secretary requires that same six-month deeming in the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.128" offset="2985859">Iowa admittedly does not follow that rule, and admits that they are directly and specifically in violation of those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.484" offset="3027237">The Secretary's regulations, then, in our view, when evaluated, that is, that regulation bringing the one month and six month rule over from SSI to Medicaid, when evaluated under the Batterton-Gray Panthers test which this Court has established balance the overall policies of the Medicaid program, that is, the attached... assuring that categorical eligible people, SSI people, get Medicaid, with Section 17(b) and (d) of the Medicaid Act, that give the Secretary the power to determine what income is available and talk about the limited exception to deeming for spouses and parents to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.285" offset="3242486">The regulations recognize therefore that Section (d), the authorization for the limited deeming, and I think it is important again to note that this Court recognize that Congress generally was opposed to deeming but allowed a limited exception, recognize that (d) is such a limited exception, but it also recognized that the subsequent enactment by Congress of the SSI program in 1972 amounted to a modification of Section (d), such that (d) could not be used to deprive SSI recipients of benefits.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="823.397" stopTime="838.257">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="823.397" offset="3414894">Mr. Dudovitz, let me ask, does your class encompass both the categorically and the optional categorically needy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_s_dudovitz" startTime="838.257" stopTime="841.276">
            <label>Mr. Neal S. Dudovitz</label>
            <text syncTime="838.257" offset="3474349">Yes, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.340" offset="3478633">There is no distinction in the class between the two.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="841.276" stopTime="850.131">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="841.276" offset="3486470">Does the regulation that was struck down apply only to the optional categorically needy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_s_dudovitz" startTime="850.131" stopTime="1206.626">
            <label>Mr. Neal S. Dudovitz</label>
            <text syncTime="850.131" offset="3521892">It is my understanding that the regulation would apply to everyone about the SSI recipients and the optionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.570" offset="3555642">It is important to recognize that as I think both our brief and the brief the federal government points out, that the optional categorical people are in effect categorical people, and that the federal government has always applied the same rules to all of them, and the Secretary has always understood that it was the intent of Congress that they be treated the same, again, recognizing that the optionals was a voluntary choice by the state of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.923" offset="3672984">They did not have to choose to cover those people, but that was their choice to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.874" offset="3688867">The Secretary's regulations then are no more restrictive than the SSI deeming rules which the same states have to use, and it is in our view the only way to assure that the SSI link has effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.953" offset="3773085">Iowa, to our knowledge, is by itself in its interpretation of these rules and statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.595" offset="3823658">The only other state to our knowledge that has ever argued that they can ignore these deeming rules was the state of Florida, and as I think we noted in our briefs, in the Griswold case the federal district judge enjoined Florida from undertaking their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.307" offset="3894503">The federal government has always agreed with the position of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.759" offset="3912370">Simply that... the simple question is, if Iowa can do what it is trying to do here, if it can be an SSI state, but then pick and choose which SSI rules it wants to use in the Medicaid program, it effectively emasculates the link and deprives the federal government of any opportunity to control the Medicaid program, for which it is the primary funder.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.426" offset="4014979">Another interesting point in this case is that again if you look at the Department of Social Services' decision attached to the appendix in this case, you will note that there were two federal SSI rules brought over to the Medicaid program which were at stake initially in the Herweg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.121" offset="4081853">One was the deeming question, and the other was the income disregards question.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.024" offset="4105467">That is, how much of Mr. Herweg's income would be disregarded under the SSI rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.809" offset="4124589">Iowa chose to change that also initially, but in its decision on the Herwegs' case, it reversed itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.165" offset="4149980">It said, we are bound to follow the SSI income rules for the Herwegs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.200" offset="4166176">Therefore, we have to use the SSI exemptions, but we are not bound to follow the SSI deeming rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.437" offset="4195120">Petitioners submit that makes no sense under a federal-state cooperative program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.941" offset="4213092">Iowa has made a few arguments that I wish to deal with on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.462" offset="4251126">One, they have implied that there is somehow some inherent power in the state of Iowa to do deeming through the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.652" offset="4287907">As I indicated in response to Justice O'Connor's question, Iowa's inherent power to the extent it exists is found in the relative responsibility laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.841" offset="4320716">The Medicaid program is a federal-state cooperative program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.626" offset="4335867">Iowa doesn't have any inherent powers there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.495" offset="4347257">What a federal-state cooperative program does is, Congress says that these are the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.066" offset="4369618">If you want to use federal money, you have to agree to follow the rules, and Congress determines who has the power to set the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.320" offset="4398561">It seems clear here that they have given the Secretary the power in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.956" offset="4417160">Section 17(d) is not mandatory, and again is modified by Congress's subsequent enactment of the link.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.579" offset="4455613">I think it is again important to recognize that in evaluating federal-state cooperative programs like the Medicaid program and the AFDC program, this Court must look at the overall policy and intent of Congress, as Justice Rehnquist noted in the Filberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.857" offset="4520710">It is not just one sentence or one word that is important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.893" offset="4532935">It is the entire overall policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.595" offset="4543698">And there is no question that the overall policy is to ensure that SSI recipients receive Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.164" offset="4577970">The second major point that I think Iowa tries to make is, they try to argue that the SSI program does not actually require that there be no deeming after one month, and they imply that that is in fact the Secretary's idea rather than Congress's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.745" offset="4656338">In SSI, however, Congress specifically in statute set forth in great detail most of the eligibility rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.684" offset="4692073">Not only did they talk about only deeming in one-month and six-month times, but in Section 1382(a)(2), where they define unearned income once people are separate, for people, or for all persons, I should say, including when people are separated, they indicated that support and maintenance can be considered unearned income only if supplied in cash or in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.399" offset="4790920">It is not the Secretary, but it is Congress that set forth these SSI deeming rules that the Secretary has now brought over to the Medicaid program by virtue of the link and his authority under 17(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.595" offset="4855704">It seems to me that it is perfectly reasonable for the Secretary, balancing all these interests, to use Congress's enacted eligibility conditions in the Medicaid program as a way to effectuate the link.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.520" offset="4911397">If there are no other questions, I will save the remainder of my time for rebuttal, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.764" offset="5084432">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Members of the Court, in addition to responding to whatever questions you may have, I think it would be most helpful if I focus on four general areas of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.036" offset="5129467">First, I think we have to understand precisely what the regulation under question here does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.476" offset="5155276">It stands for the following proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.542" offset="5163531">If I am a wealthy lawyer earning $100,000 a year, and I have a spouse who for whatever medical reason needs to be institutionalized in a skilled 24-hour a day nursing home, a person representing the Iowa Department of Social Services cannot deem my income available to the spouse that is institutionalized beyond a one-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.328" offset="5282649">The only alternative for the state of Iowa is to use spousal responsibility statutes that Justice O'Connor referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.017" offset="5313369">With respect to those spousal responsibility statutes, I would like to point out that the Court in Gray Panthers was rather explicit in outlining how impractical resort by administrative agencies like that Iowa Department of Social Services to spousal responsibility statutes are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.777" offset="5376481">There are difficulties of obtaining service, there is a protracted litigation, and it is almost not worth the... sometimes.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1319.930" offset="5401036">But in the example that you are giving, of course, of the wealthy non-institutionalized spouse, that shouldn't pose such a problem, should it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="brent_r_appel" startTime="1328.703" stopTime="1553.050">
            <label>Mr. Brent R. Appel</label>
            <text syncTime="1328.703" offset="5436145">Well, except when you get a multiplicity of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.238" offset="5446280">We are not dealing with ten, fifteen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.274" offset="5458401">We could have quite a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.476" offset="5463208">It is somewhat like the child support recovery program, which we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.694" offset="5476060">Now, that is a little different, in part, because there is no federal largesse involved, and therefore we have a little higher standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.832" offset="5500615">We have got to serve process, and we have got to have the court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.950" offset="5513154">But here we are linking it to Medicaid benefits that are actually paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.736" offset="5528305">But that is the effect of the regulation at bar here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.688" offset="5544083">Secondly, I would like to clarify models of adjudication that are really... really at issue here, and the petitioners and the state of Iowa have distinctly different models.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.595" offset="5583685">The petitioners have a legislative effect model.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.280" offset="5594447">Basically what they are saying is that Health and Human Services has kind of sketched in the details of the Congressional statute, and that therefore the regulation involved is entitled to legislative effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.255" offset="5650349">The theory that you are all, of course, familiar with is that specialized agencies ought to fill in those gaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.259" offset="5670411">This Court doesn't sit as kind of a super-agency to review closed decision-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.063" offset="5689533">But Iowa has a distinctly different model.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.598" offset="5699668">Iowa's model is the ultra vires model that says that the Secretary of HHS in creating this one-month iron curtain on deeming is not sketching in detail, but is totally outside the Congressional framework, and as a result or that this is an area where courts traditionally police the agencies, and since the regulation involved is invalid, it has no effect from the beginning, and Iowa is not in violation of any valid regulation promulgated by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.950" offset="5821085">So, those are the two models that I think are distinctly different, and that may give the case some focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.854" offset="5840729">Let me share with you some of the reasons why Iowa believes the ultra vires model is more applicable than the legislative effect model.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.175" offset="5874062">First, we go to the statute itself, Section 17(b) and (d) of the Medicaid program itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.363" offset="5902796">Basically what this statutory framework says is that the states must promulgate reasonable standards for Medicaid; 17(b) notes that the state can only consider available income</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.207" offset="5966117">"according to standards prescribed by the Secretary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.175" offset="5978029">and then 17(d) talks about spousal deeming of income, and basically 17(d) says that other than spouses you can't deem income because consanguinity isn't close enough, but spouses is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.019" offset="6037379">Now, the Court in the Gray Panthers case construed that provision, 17(d), and on 17(d) it said, unless we hold this as express authorization for the state to deem the income of spouses, it would be superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.178" offset="6090042">It would be meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.278" offset="6094431">It is a little awkward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.094" offset="6097670">It doesn't expressly grant the states the authority to deem spousal income, but it knocks everyone else out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.700" offset="6124106">It knocks out brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.984" offset="6133301">But in Gray Panthers, if you read the case carefully, it states clearly that unless you construe 17(d) to mean states, you can deem spousal income, it would be literally stricken from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.294" offset="6182516">Secondly, in Gray Panthers there is a gloss of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.280" offset="6210414">I don't want to protract that, but one of the Senate committee reports that is cited there states that it is proper to expect spouses to support each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.386" offset="6242911">I think that comports fairly with our everyday experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.588" offset="6255658">Secondly, let me point out the Secretary has not promulgated a standard, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.409" offset="6278960">Iowa's position is that it is a time limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.694" offset="6292125">It has no connection at all with the availability of income, how much money the other spouse is making, what the obligations of the other spouse might be on the strength of the marriage relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.050" offset="6333503">Would Iowa object to any time limitation that the Secretary might impose on deeming?</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent R. Appel</label>
            <text syncTime="1558.371" offset="6354819">I think it would be conceivable that a time limitation would be appropriate if it could be shown that it had some kind of rational relationship with expectations of spousal support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.928" offset="6401004">If the Secretary in notice and comment in the Federal Register said, listen, we have decided that after six years or five years the family obligation dilutes, or practical experience shows that we just can't enforce it... strike that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.771" offset="6460458">I don't mean to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.871" offset="6464847">But experience shows us that somehow the family relationship is so diluted then that you can't expect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.358" offset="6486790">Then, perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.294" offset="6490552">For instance, in the Dandridge case, we are talking about standard of need for AFDC and the result of it as well, and it is described by this Court as a yardstick, a measuring device, something like standard review that the court uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.803" offset="6552514">You can have a stringent standard of review in First Amendment cases, or a lax standard of review as we have in agency cases where legislative effect is given to the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.777" offset="6596400">But what the Secretary has done is in fact set no standard, but kind of brought down a time limitation that is irrational.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.498" offset="6735267">I don't think that Congress intended for the Secretary to be able to use a one-month cutoff that has no relationship whatever to spousal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.640" offset="6779884">In effect what that does is through regulation draw a dotted line through 17(d) of the statute, and I think that is ultra vires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.496" offset="6815306">The Secretary clearly has power to prescribe standards, and draw the lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.583" offset="6835681">The Secretary may come in and say, listen, it is unreasonable to expect more than $300 of income deemed to the other spouse from a person who earns $15,000, or wherever they set the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.704" offset="7276106">Well, the reason for that, I think, is that they misapplied the Batterton test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.108" offset="7297735">The Batterton test, I would suggest, is not applicable in this precise setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.762" offset="7320409">Why is it not applicable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.631" offset="7327828">First, in Batterton... Batterton is an interesting case, and it somewhat tracks the case, but let me distinguish it while it is open to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.034" offset="7361474">Batterton, as I am sure you will recall, was a case that involved unemployment benefits, and the Health and Human Services had a regulation which allowed states to disqualify families from AFDC benefits if the father became unemployed because of illegal activity that might have disqualified the father from unemployment benefits under state law, unlawful strike, that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.185" offset="7462098">And the Batterton case made a couple of observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.887" offset="7480906">First, it noted that there was no indication in the statutory language or history that this factor could not be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.409" offset="7514969">That is at 430... 432 U. S. 425.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.979" offset="7529285">Au contraire here, here we have the express 17(d), which has been held that it allows spousal deeming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.649" offset="7563871">Other than that, it is going to get stricken... it is stricken from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.953" offset="7577141">And so therefore it is distinguishable there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.405" offset="7590934">Second, in Batterton it was conceded that the Secretary could not adopt a regulation that has no meaningful relationship to any recognized concept of unemployment or that would defeat the purposes of Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.616" offset="7659792">Let me put this in the context of the present case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2387.482" offset="9671221">And of those 7 percent, many of them have very little income at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.100" offset="9689716">They are also eligible spouses, and so there is no deeming to be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.539" offset="10035472">I am not sure how much income we could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.408" offset="10050937">We would have to hire new attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.708" offset="10056161">We would have to pursue service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.109" offset="10069745">I do know that in our child support recovery operations in our own office, we have seven or eight attorneys, and they are traveling around the state, and I might point out that those attorneys under Iowa law are paid for out of the social services budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.119" offset="10121781">So for every dollar we expend on attorneys, you know, to litigate these cases, it is coming out of social services generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.773" offset="10152396">I don't know whether the expenses would be worth... it would certainly be an administrative burden, and again, the Court in Gray Panthers I thought was rather clear on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.331" offset="10198685">A few other miscellaneous observations, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.936" offset="10229092">Again I want to stress the narrowness of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.721" offset="10244243">We are not challenging the whole SSI and Medicaid concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.542" offset="10263469">If Congress tomorrow passes a statute that adds another category to SSI benefits generally, we are moving right along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.815" offset="10300563">Iowa will adopt it because it is an SSI state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.231" offset="10310280">If Congress adds five categories tomorrow, Iowa will move right along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.802" offset="10328566">It is an SSI state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.935" offset="10333059">The only thing we are saying is that the Medicaid statute expressly allows us to do spousal deeming, and we want to do so in a reasonable fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.908" offset="10360958">To hold otherwise is really a repeal of 17(d) by implication, if we allow the Secretary's regulation to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.579" offset="10391678">And that, I think, is quite a dubious proposition, where there is no express statutory provision overriding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.917" offset="10421040">Let me close by saying that Iowa is interested in concentrating its resources on those most in need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.940" offset="10461059">That is the name of Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.225" offset="10466179">That is the purpose for which it was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.642" offset="10471926">And a reasonable deeming regulation does just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.927" offset="10489063">It avoids the prospect of having lawyers riding circuit across the state trying to litigate the cases that were disproved... the process which was disproved in Gray Panthers, that provides that relatively wealthy spouses will not have an opportunity to slide out of their Medicaid obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.507" offset="10567325">It focuses our dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.709" offset="10576207">And, you know, whatever the financial impact is on this case, it is going to mean there is less money for something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.046" offset="10605464">Maybe Iowa will have to abandon its policy of having optional needy with Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.867" offset="10628765">Maybe Iowa goes back to a 209(b) state if the pressures get so great, which we think is an undesirable policy, because of the lowered eligibility, and because of the impact it would have on minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.443" offset="10683100">We don't want to be a 209(b) state, emphatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.812" offset="10692609">But we think that the policy adopted by the Secretary of HHS simply is contrary to the statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.417" offset="10735032">It is contrary to 17(d) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.719" offset="10748197">It doesn't make sense in terms of the general policy of deeming since family obligations continue over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.421" offset="10770976">They don't change after one month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.873" offset="10776827">They remain the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.156" offset="10781947">Administrative enforcement is the only way to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.610" offset="10795740">This is a case of ultra vires action by the Secretary, not a case of line drawing... to legislative effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neal S. Dudovitz</label>
            <text syncTime="2682.917" offset="10853000">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.904" offset="10868987">I would like to just clarify a couple of points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.856" offset="10880795">I want to emphasize again that nobody has mandated anything on the state of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.427" offset="10910992">There are lots of choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.546" offset="10915485">And point out a point that I think was neglected a second ago, that while Iowa can become a 209(b) state, and they can have more liberal eligibility rules than they had in 1972, they just cannot have any more restrictive rules, so Iowa's 209(b) program isn't specifically mandated to be exactly as it was in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.209" offset="11002212">It just can't be more restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.375" offset="11006809">So if they want to add a few more people under the 209(b) program, they absolutely can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.661" offset="11023946">Secondly, I would note again that Section 17(d) is not mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.802" offset="11064488">Section 17(d) is permissive, and the problem in the Gray Panthers case was, the argument was being made that there could be no deeming in the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.359" offset="11114747">What this Court held is that the Secretary must allow at times that there be deeming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.596" offset="11139720">The second important distinction is, what we were dealing with or what this Court was dealing with in the Gray Panthers decision and interpreting (b) and (d) was that Congress intended in 1965, when it enacted the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.023" offset="11197399">Again, Congress modified the Medicaid program a number of times, particularly in 1972, when they dealt with the change of the link and how its effect is on the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.748" offset="11244315">By doing that, essentially, Congress almost in some sense said that the legislative history at the time (b) and (d) were adopted did not quite have the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.090" offset="11301680">So even if it might have been stronger in 1965, the requirement of the link to the SSI program, which no one seems to deny here, essentially modifies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.148" offset="11349954">It makes it clear the Secretary is reasonable in saying, look, you can deem sometimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.766" offset="11368344">And remember, Iowa can deem sometimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.802" offset="11376494">In fact, it can deem to the extent that the Congress found it reasonable to deem in the SSI program, a program for poor people, so that the wealthy spouse that my brother talked about would in fact get SSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.811" offset="11440547">That what the Secretary did is make a reasonable balance between the needs of the link, the permissiveness of (d) but not the mandatory nature of (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.000" offset="11477327">And in that conjunction I want to point out again that it is not the Secretary who set up those deeming rules in SSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.825" offset="11520586">It is Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.975" offset="11525183">We are not talking about a question of a Secretary so-called misinterpreting the SSI deeming rules, and I refer again to Section 1382(a)(2)(a), which is the definition of unearned income in determining eligibility for an SSI recipient, enacted by Congress, which indicates that you cannot consider support and maintenance unless provided in cash or in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.375" offset="11626852">Finally, I would like to reiterate the distinct difference, I think, between the arguments that were being made in Gray Panthers and the arguments that were being made here with regard to state relative responsibility laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.754" offset="11692367">What this Court was addressing in Gray Panthers when it noted the inadequacy of the relative responsibility law was the argument that the Gray Panthers had made that the relative responsibility laws are the only mechanism, and when the Court made a notation to the transcript of the oral argument that counsel had acknowledged the difficulty of getting relief to the relative responsibility, counsel was talking about those close cases where it would be just as difficult, in fact, very difficult to expect a state to order it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.856" offset="11812739">In the situation of a wealthy spouse, it is not very difficult to enforce the relative responsibility laws, and the relative responsibility laws we are talking about here are in addition to, not the only remedy, and that is, a state can still do deeming under Medicaid for the one-month and six-month period, and in addition has its relative responsibility laws for remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.937" offset="11901033">So that there is, it seems to me, a distinct difference between the problem that this Court was referring to in its notation in Gray Panthers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.708" offset="11932171">I have nothing further unless there are any other questions, Your Honor.</text>
