            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="76800">We will hear arguments first this morning in Weinberger against Romero-Barcelo.</text>

            <label>Ms. Elinor H. Stillman</label>
            <text syncTime="16.610" offset="143151">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.878" offset="152242">This case is here on Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.381" offset="174289">Petitioners seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals judgment are the Secretary of Defense and officers of the Navy and the Marine Corps.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.802" offset="203964">This action, which was brought by the Governor of Puerto Rico and others to enjoin the Navy's use of Vieques Island for weapons training, raised claims under a number of different statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="244402">But the issue for review in this Court is simply whether a district court, upon finding a violation of Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act respecting discharges of pollutants is required, regardless of circumstances, to enter an order directing the immediate cessation of the activity producing the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.572" offset="323082">The court of appeals read the Act as imposing such a constraint on the court's remedial discretion, and it thus held that the district court lacks discretion to enter a less extreme order requiring the Navy promptly to seek a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit, commonly termed an NPDES permit, for the intermittent discharge of pollutants into the waters of Vieques Island that are part of the principal Naval Weapons Training area for the Atlantic fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.422" offset="438439">Petitioners submit that neither the language nor the purposes of this Act require this constraint on a district court's traditional exercise of discretion in shaping equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.128" offset="481280">Indeed, the court of appeals' holding represents an unprecedented construction of the Clean Water Act, requiring an all-or-nothing approach to enforcement which would preclude any kind of credible enforcement program by EPA or by authorized state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.820" offset="544078">Before discussing these larger implications of the court of appeals' holding, however, I would first like briefly to summarize some of the factual findings which led the district court to conclude that the order it entered adequately vindicated the interests of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.980" offset="600712">The eastern half of Vieques Island is part of what is known as the inner range of the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility headquartered at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on the main island of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.138" offset="649300">Ships, planes and Marines landing in amphibious maneuvers fire at air-to-ground targets, ship-to-shore targets, and artillery targets located in narrow zone on the eastern end of Vieques.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.445" offset="694544">Both inert and live ordnance is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.397" offset="706351">The exercises which take place some 200 days a year are coordinated from Roosevelt Roads and from an observation point on Vieques.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.903" offset="736340">They are essential to the maintenance of operational qualification standards for the Atlantic Fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.457" offset="758596">Vieques is the only location presently available in which the fleet can engage in a full range of exercises simulating the conditions of actual combat.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.163" offset="793391">In the course of these exercises, some of the ordnance misses the land-base targets and drops into waters within the three mile limit of Vieques.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.336" offset="830067">Under terms of the Clean Water Act, this is a discharge of a pollutant from a point source, requiring an NPDES permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.774" offset="863817">This is so because the definition of pollutants includes munitions, and a point source is any discrete conveyance including vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.063" offset="904986">EPA has never developed any effluent limitation guidelines for a point source class or category of military forces conducting weapons exercises.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.938" offset="948454">Hence, the Navy committed no violation of any existing technology-based effluent limitation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.275" offset="973845">And the district court, following the trial of some 50 days, determined that the Navy's activities did not violate any of Puerto Rico's water quality laws, that no credible evidence established that the discharges had any measurable deleterious effect on the Vieques waters, and indeed, that there was no appreciable harm to the Vieques ecology.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.922" offset="1052421">In fact, the court concluded that the Navy's presence on Vieques had, on the whole, worked to the benefit rather than the detriment of the environment there.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.276" offset="1085858">And this was so because the Navy had to place restrictions on a large area around the area in which the weapons training is carried on, and these restrictions limited the amount of human trespassing that had caused problems for some of the area... would have caused problems absent these restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.173" offset="1165479">In sum, on the record there appeared to be no violation of any water quality standards or any technology-based standards, and the Navy's lack of an NPDES permit was the only apparent violation of the Clean Water Act.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="284.747" offset="1215739">Mrs. Stillman, I take it that the EPA was prepared to issue a permit, but was unable to do so because Puerto Rico had refused to certify compliance with local water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.859" offset="1280209">Is there no way that the Navy can challenge Puerto Rico's refusal, or is that going to be a permanent?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elinor_h_stillman" startTime="308.865" stopTime="329.026">
            <label>Ms. Elinor H. Stillman</label>
            <text syncTime="308.865" offset="1312183">The Navy can challenge the refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.398" offset="1322318">I must say that that is still in litigation at the administrative stage in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.284" offset="1341858">There is still a motion for reconsideration pending, at least the last time I checked.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.838" offset="1360144">And we understand that the Environmental Quality Board there will probably issue a decision on that February 26.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="329.026" stopTime="331.628">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="329.026" offset="1392849">And if that happened, it would solve the problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elinor_h_stillman" startTime="331.628" stopTime="347.071">
            <label>Ms. Elinor H. Stillman</label>
            <text syncTime="331.628" offset="1403298">Well, if they grant the certification I think the permit probably would issue then because EPA has developed a draft permit under which, I might add, the Navy would be required to monitor water quality and make reports.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="347.071" stopTime="353.594">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="347.071" offset="1465051">And also, I understand the President could give an exemption from the permit requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.310" offset="1490024">Is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elinor_h_stillman" startTime="353.594" stopTime="458.391">
            <label>Ms. Elinor H. Stillman</label>
            <text syncTime="353.594" offset="1491174">Yes, he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.010" offset="1500787">I was going to get to this later in my talk, but since you bring it up I'll address it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.413" offset="1522416">Section 313 of the Act provides for a presidential exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.301" offset="1541956">There are two kinds of exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.601" offset="1547180">There is one exemption for an effluent source of any agency, Executive Branch agency or department, for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.073" offset="1577064">It's an exemption except from Sections 306 and 307 of the Act, if the President finds it in the paramount interest of the United States to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.031" offset="1620846">There's a second exemption provision which may be given for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.999" offset="1640699">It has to be done by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.768" offset="1647804">And this can be for weapons of the military forces and related military equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.539" offset="1674867">Now, respondents have suggested, and certainly, the court of appeals seemed to rely on this also, that the existence of this exemption provision somehow meant that the district court was denied discretion to do what it did in the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.166" offset="1749368">That this exemption provision must be the only way that you can ever allow, even for a limited time, any carrying out of military exercises without the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.941" offset="1788552">We strongly believe this is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.676" offset="1807464">For one thing, I think it's got to be understood that the exemption is not the equivalent of what the district court did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.282" offset="1845917">Under the three-year exemption, the Navy would not be required to do what it will be required to do under this permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.618" offset="1871203">Under the permit, if it issues, the Navy will be required to monitor, I believe, nine different, they call them parameters, but it's monitoring for rhinos like iron and acidity and so on.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="458.391" stopTime="465.761">

            <text syncTime="458.391" offset="1910282">Mrs. Stillman, couldn't the President take care of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="459.891" offset="1916343">Couldn't he say to the Navy, we would like you to follow these restrictions?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="477.788" offset="1987918">He would have the power to grant a total exemption, but do you think it's correct to assume that he would never exercise his discretion in a sort of a discretionary way and say well, I'll grant the exemption but only with these strings attached.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.361" offset="2034207">No, I don't suggest there are limits on his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.212" offset="2045597">We're simply saying that we think the best accommodation under the best way of accommodating the interests of the Clean Water Act here is to find a solution where the court doesn't have to choose between on the one hand saying that national defense efforts will be held up, and on the other hand saying get an exemption, which may not require you to do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.599" offset="4343118">If the Administrator thought that there was a situation here that demanded emergency action, that demanded immediate cessation remedy, he has emergency powers under Section 504 of the Act to go in and ask the court for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.905" offset="4388362">Evidently, EPA did not think that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.893" offset="4412291">And also, I might point out that the order that the court has given here is to invoke the EPA review processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.064" offset="4441025">That is, they ordered the Navy, go get the permit, at which point the Navy has to submit an application to EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.135" offset="4465267">And EPA has not been left out of this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.420" offset="4478433">It is not cordoned off by what the court did here in any way, and we don't think that it really undermines EPA's participation or EPA's role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.895" offset="4524304">I would like to also touch on the reliance that the other side has placed on TVA against Hill and Steelworkers against United States, because they suggested that this is just a case in which we are trying to say pay no attention to what Congress did; Congress did something very unwise here, and do it this way because we think this is a better way of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.795" offset="4631928">We think TVA v. Hill was a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.414" offset="4642377">In that case, the injunction sought was to enjoin the closing of the gates of Tellico Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.151" offset="4669336">If, in fact, those gates had been closed, this would have resulted in the destruction of the critical habitat of an endangered species, against the direct prohibition of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.995" offset="4724715">And this kind of irreversible and prohibited result was inconsistent with what Congress seemed clearly to require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.250" offset="4757734">In the Steelworkers case there was a very specific remedial directive from Congress... upon making these factual findings, give the 80-day Taft-Hartley injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.639" offset="4803291">Now, that is a very different situation from the provision for judicial relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.193" offset="4825548">As I said, there is a provision for immediate cessation orders; that is in Section 504 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.680" offset="4847491">And that is upon certain emergency findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.499" offset="4862746">Now, we don't, of course, suggest that the fact that that remedy is specified in Section 504 means it would be unavailable in federal enforcement suits under 309 or in citizens' suits under 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.523" offset="4906841">We only suggest that since Congress didn't even mention it in these other two statutes, it can't have meant that that was the only remedy that could be given in those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.545" offset="4938919">I also want to make it clear that the kind of discretion that we are talking about here is a discretion to time final compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.085" offset="4977058">We are not suggesting that there's any discretion to vary standards of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.620" offset="4991269">In other words, the court would not be free to say well, this discharger is not harming water quality standards; therefore, he is not going to have to comply with the technology-based effluent limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.576" offset="5031079">The court can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.459" offset="5034632">The court also couldn't say well, there's a discharge here but it's quite harmless and it looks to us pretty unimportant, and so therefore, we're going to excuse him from compliance with the permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.015" offset="11156793">It took away a provision from the old statute, which indeed had existed since 1948, that allowed for the formulation of decrees by the court on the basis of equity and other factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.271" offset="11381864">The fact that there were no effluent guidelines does not make... does not release the Navy from having to have a permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.342" offset="11514149">But again, this Court has said not what is appropriate, but what did Congress provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.979" offset="11536614">Let me make one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.031" offset="11552914">The Navy has said that the interests of Puerto Rico really were protected by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.971" offset="11588650">But what this does is to really second-guess the entire process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.857" offset="11608189">It second-guesses the administrative process, it second-guesses what the President had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.428" offset="11630446">And with respect to the administrative process, the administrative process that the EPA will go into is more than... well, are things being banged up out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.700" offset="11667540">They are going to look into monitoring, they are going to look into... which the Navy has already admitted is one of the criteria that is going to be looked into, or was provided in this particular permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.025" offset="11716859">When the EPA looks at this, it will cover other things like what kind of limitations, when, where, how, and a number of things that a district court simply does not look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.349" offset="11766178">And therefore, the interests of the particular state are, indeed, not protected by what the district court, this district court, did in this particular case.</text>
