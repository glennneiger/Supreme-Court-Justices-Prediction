            <label>Mr. Edward C. Carnes</label>
            <text syncTime="60.705" offset="381961">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a federal habeas case here on certiorari from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.358" offset="408606">Respondent in this case is a murderer named Evans who was convicted and sentenced to death under the Alabama capital punishment statute, which was later involved in this Court's decision in Beck v. Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.547" offset="449357">At this time this Court handed down its Beck decision, Respondent Evans' conviction and sentence had already been affirmed by the state appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.867" offset="478614">This Court had denied certiorari, and the district court had denied the federal habeas petition which is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.021" offset="507244">After the Beck decision was handed down, the Fifth Circuit reversed the denial of habeas, and held that Beck required that Evans be retried and resentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.794" offset="542353">It did so in spite of the fact that this case is different from the Beck case in every material way.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.797" offset="566385">The facts in this case are virtually unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.397" offset="576730">Early in 1977, Evans and a co-defendant named Ritter, both of whom had just been released on parole from an Indiana prison, began a cross-country crime spree.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.855" offset="618630">That crime spree lasted over two months, and by their own admission, involved between two and three dozen violent felonies committed in seven different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.211" offset="652067">One of those violent felonies was a robbery they committed of a pawn shop in Mobile, Alabama, in January of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.615" offset="681638">It is absolutely undisputed in the record that prior to that robbery, which is the basis of this case, Evans and Ritter had discussed the possibility that one of their robbery victims might try to go for a weapon, and that they had agreed between themselves that if that happened they would kill him.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.374" offset="740674">When Evans and Ritter entered the pawn shop in Mobile, a man named Mr. Nassar was working behind the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.611" offset="761572">Evans pulled a pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.461" offset="768991">Nassar dropped to his hands and knees behind the counter and started crawling away.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.515" offset="785291">Evans thought that Nassar might be going for a gun, so he leaned over the counter and deliberately shot him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.317" offset="808488">They then pulled another robbery in Mobile, and left that state to continue their crime spree in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.006" offset="839208">During the crime spree, and after they had killed Nassar, Evans telephoned an FBI agent in his home town and offered to turn himself in if that FBI agent could guarantee Evans that he would be executed when he turned himself in.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.881" offset="890722">The agent told Evans he couldn't make him any promises, and for that reason Evans refused to turn himself in.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.682" offset="913918">That is from Evans' own sworn testimony at the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.517" offset="925203">After more robberies, Evans and Ritter were finally captured in Little Rock, Arkansas, by FBI agents in March of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.906" offset="954774">From the very beginning, instead of contesting his guilt, Evans admitted it and bragged about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.893" offset="978702">He confessed to the robbery and murder of Nassar and the two to three dozen other violent felonies he had committed to the FBI agent who captured him within hours of his capture, to the Mobile police officers after he waived extradition and was returned to Alabama, and to the news media at every available opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.022" offset="1051218">Evans insisted that he wanted to be convicted and sentenced to death for the murder, and his insistence on that so frustrated his attorneys that they arranged through the court to have Evans examined by a psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.227" offset="1096044">The psychiatrist did examine Evans, and he reported back to the court that Evans was competent and rational, that he knew the difference between right and wrong, that he thoroughly understood the nature and consequences of his actions, and that he sincerely preferred execution to a long term in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.605" offset="1161559">Before that, Evans had voluntarily appeared before the grand jury, over the objections of his attorney, and had testified under oath to the grand jury that he had robbed and murdered Mr. Nassar, that he fully understood what he was doing, that Nassar was not the first person he had killed, and that he would kill again in the same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.383" offset="1228746">Evans also testified to the grand jury that he preferred execution over life in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.835" offset="1246509">Then, at arraignment, Evans pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.370" offset="1256645">The judge entered Evans' guilty plea in the official minutes of the court, but nonetheless scheduled the case for trial, because that is the peculiar procedure in Alabama capital case guilty pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.826" offset="1294470">At the trial, the state presented overwhelming evidence of Evans' guilt, including the testimony of eye witnesses and undisputed scientific evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.749" offset="1326131">After the state had rested its case, Evans filed a written motion to plead guilty, which was accepted into evidence and went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.920" offset="1354865">Then Evans took--</text>

            <text syncTime="320.881" offset="1422679">Yes, Your Honor, he, as a matter of fact, told the jury that at the trial, and he told the grand jury that.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.101" offset="1447548">In the trial testimony on Page 38 of the Appendix, he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="331.136" offset="1463744">"Our whole trip was based on robbery. "</text>
            <text syncTime="334.005" offset="1475238">"Kind of a spree. "</text>
            <text syncTime="334.971" offset="1479104">"It was well planned, and I've been in crime a long time. "</text>
            <text syncTime="337.790" offset="1490389">"Before you go back in there, the only thing I've got to say to the jury is that I've been at it a long time, and if you don't come back with a death sentence, which is the only other thing I can think you can come out with, I'm going to get out and I'm going to do it again. "</text>
            <text syncTime="351.133" offset="1543678">"There's not any question whatsoever. "</text>
            <text syncTime="353.100" offset="1551620">Evans, in addition to testifying to that before the trial jury, also testified under examination by the district attorney that he felt no remorse about the killing, and that he wouldn't hesitate to kill again in the same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.892" offset="1606790">He also admitted that his attorneys had advised him some 20 to 30 times not to take the course of action he was taking at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.415" offset="1636883">There were absolutely no lesser included offense evidence of any kind whatsoever presented at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.867" offset="1658617">The jury took less than 15 minutes to convict him.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.486" offset="1669171">The next day, the judge held a sentence hearing, and after weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, found that the aggravating circumstances far outweighed the mitigating, and then the judge sentenced Evans to death, as he had requested all along to be sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.745" offset="1722147">After the case was affirmed by the Alabama appellate courts and this Court denied cert, the habeas petition, which is at issue in this Court, was filed in the federal district court in Mobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.057" offset="1799365">Under Alabama law, what we have is a coram nobis petition, which is the same thing, but under Alabama law you can't raise in a coram nobis petition any issues that you could have raised on appeal but didn't, and also, there's a very strong line of authority in Alabama law that you can't file a coram nobis petition or have any kind of collateral review unless you aver that you're innocent, something which, of course, no attorney representing Evans could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.457" offset="1905004">So, we have conceded from the very beginning that he had exhausted any state court remedies to have his federal claims aired in state court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Edward C. Carnes</label>
            <text syncTime="453.182" offset="1951920">Could not have been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.200" offset="1955995">It would have been rejected without any answer at all being required by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.252" offset="1976162">The federal habeas petition that Evans filed in federal district court, or that his new attorneys filed for him, did aver that the preclusion clause contained in the Alabama statute was unconstitutional because it prohibited jury instructions when there was evidence to support them, something this Court later found in the Beck case.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.498" offset="2061216">However, the habeas petition in this case did not aver that there was no evidence... that there was any evidence to support a lesser included offense instruction in this case, and the habeas petition did not aver that Evans had been harmed, affected, or influenced in any way by the preclusion clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.710" offset="2129971">As a matter of fact, at the habeas hearing, Evans, through his attorneys, insisted that he was attacking the statute only on its face and as applied statewide instead of for whatever reason it may have affected him.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.755" offset="2206248">--No, Your Honor, he surely didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.040" offset="2215339">As a matter of fact, the habeas transcript, his attorneys' remarks on the habeas transcript, Pages 34 and 43, they specifically say that he is not attacking it because of anything it did to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.598" offset="2269569">Quoting his attorney in the lower court on Page 34 of the hearing transcript,</text>
            <text syncTime="537.050" offset="2287332">"First of all, we are not going to argue whether or not capital punishment is good or bad, or argue whether anything regarding the statute in particular was applied in Mr. Evans' case in such a way that it was unconstitutionally applied. "</text>
            <text syncTime="549.958" offset="2339055">"What we will be arguing here is the unconstitutionality of the Alabama death penalty statute both on its face and as it has been applied in the state of Alabama. "</text>
            <text syncTime="558.647" offset="2373745">meaning statewide in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.416" offset="2380851">They essentially attempted to use the habeas petition as a declaratory judgment, but I doubt if even... they would have had even enough standing for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.056" offset="2423378">The district court denied the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.073" offset="2431424">Then, after the Beck decision was released, the Fifth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.912" offset="2458800">To the state's argument that Evans had never even argued that he was harmed, affected, or in any way influenced by the preclusion clause, the Fifth Circuit replied,</text>
            <text syncTime="591.887" offset="2506761">"However persuasive this argument might otherwise be, it has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="597.791" offset="2530375">What the Fifth Circuit thought foreclosed it from making any inquiry into harm and prejudice was the paragraph on Pages 642 and 643 of Justice Stevens' opinion, where this Court said that, "In every case we think", meaning in every case being discussed,</text>
            <text syncTime="613.301" offset="2592338">"the Alabama statute would lead to unreliable fact finding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="617.169" offset="2607907">In lifting those three words, "in every case", out of context, and misinterpreting them, the Fifth Circuit ignored the fact that the cert question was very carefully limited in Beck to cases in which there was factual evidence to support a lesser offense verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.380" offset="2672691">Also, this Court's holding on the very first page of the Beck opinion says,</text>
            <text syncTime="638.666" offset="2693798">"We hold the death penalty may not be imposed under these circumstances. "</text>

            <text syncTime="778.504" offset="3253236">Here we go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.523" offset="3265252">In the Fifth Circuit, in the initial opinion, they said, well, the state is being fundamentally unfair to Mr. Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.295" offset="3292315">First, they told him there was no lesser offense, and now they are saying, we ought to affirm his death sentence because he didn't present evidence of a lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.199" offset="3320005">That might be a valid argument for those other cases, but in this case they ignored our argument where we said, look, not only was there no evidence, but we can show you from this unusual, extraordinary record that Evans was not influenced in any way, that he would not have presented any evidence of any lesser included offense, that he launched this self-destructive legal course before he was even captured, much less before he knew anything about the preclusion clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.266" offset="3432227">When we argued that, then the Fifth Circuit came back and said, oh, well, in effect, saying, oh, well, even if you're right, we are foreclosed by the "in every case" language of Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.872" offset="3466709">The frustrating thing about that was that it seemed so clear to me that in Beck what this Court was talking about was that in every case where there was lesser offense evidence, there would be pressure on the jury not to acquit the capital offense because the jury was convinced the man was guilty of a serious lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.084" offset="3539538">You can't have the jury convinced that he is guilty of a serious lesser offense unless there is some evidence that places in dispute an element of the higher offense not necessary to the lower offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.391" offset="3584782">No jury could rationally, anywhere, say that Evans might be guilty of a serious lesser offense instead of the capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.145" offset="3615711">Your opinion seemed so clear, but the Fifth Circuit just wouldn't see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.215" offset="3636087">In view of the fact that Beck itself does not mandate reversal in this case, harm and prejudice is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.221" offset="3668060">It's necessary because this Court's decisions recognize that there is a general requirement of harm and prejudice to establish a constitutional violation in any case, with two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.411" offset="3712782">One is where there is a specific Bill of Right guarantee involved, which is not involved in this case, and the other is where there is a denial of a procedural right which has been specifically recognized as encompassed within the right to fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.336" offset="3768475">The best example I know of this is the Beck case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.555" offset="3781432">This Court recognized at least in death cases that the giving of lesser included offenses when the evidence justified them was necessary to a fair trial, specifically and necessary, but that doesn't control this case, because this Court has never held, and no court has ever held that giving lesser included offense instructions when there was no evidence to support it was necessary for a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.670" offset="3877876">Instead, their contention basically, and what the Fifth Circuit probably is saying is that it is fundamentally unfair, the existence of the preclusion clause itself was unfair and detrimental.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.144" offset="3931793">Every fundamental fairness claim this Court has ever decided, it has required a showing of harm and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.215" offset="3956034">The burden to prove harm and prejudice should be on Evans, not only because it is part of his claim, a threshold part of his claim, but also because this is a habeas corpus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.790" offset="4002323">The interesting thing about both the Fifth Circuit opinions is, after they said initially this is a habeas case in the Southern District of Alabama, they never again mentioned habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.497" offset="4041193">Also, Evans, in this Court, his entire brief, beside a passing reference, the references to this habeas case, never discusses the significance of this being a habeas corpus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.888" offset="4090722">They ignore entirely Henderson v. Kibbe, where this Court said that not only did you have to show prejudice, but you had to show more than you would show in a direct appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1059.834" offset="4378487">We also find support for our position that this is a specially significant case because it is a habeas corpus case from Mr. Justice Stevens' separate opinion earlier this month in Rose v. Lundy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.375" offset="4428642">The Fifth Circuit said, and they argue here, that Chapman v. California placed the burden on the state to disprove harm and prejudice beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.648" offset="4461765">That is wrong because Chapman applies, as it said, only where a constitutional violation is first established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.385" offset="4488723">No constitutional violation has been established in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.956" offset="4503038">Instead, harm and prejudice is a threshold requirement to their fundamental fairness claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.824" offset="4522473">If this were a case where lesser included offense instructions should have been given because there was evidence for them, then Chapman would apply, but there is no constitutional requirement for lesser offense instructions absent evidence for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.017" offset="4579211">But in any event, perhaps it is a moot argument, because the record in this case not only does not support Evans' contention that he was harmed or prejudiced or any conceivable contention, but it also disproves beyond a reasonable doubt and beyond any doubt any harm or prejudice on Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.312" offset="4652459">It shows there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.581" offset="4657474">It shows it in two ways, first, because there was no evidence at trial at all to support it, and then also because it shows that the preclusion clause didn't influence or affect his course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.805" offset="4710451">The best way to point this out is from the crucial, decisive, absolutely undisputed fact that Evans, according to his own sworn statements, began this self-destructive course of action before he knew anything at all about the preclusion clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.885" offset="4786728">Also, the record, which is unusually complete, does not reflect that the existence of the preclusion clause after he learned of it had any reinforcement effect whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.841" offset="4826539">He started certainly when he called the FBI agent and said, I'll turn myself in if you can guarantee me you'll be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.559" offset="4849422">He hadn't heard of the preclusion clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.427" offset="4856841">He hadn't heard of the mandatory verdict form requirement or anything of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.362" offset="4872619">The jury verdict form requirement is an alternative grounds that they assert this case should be reversed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.302" offset="4904384">Now, this, Alabama's pre-Beck capital punishment statute, the one Evans was tried under, was not a mandatory death penalty statute, as witnessed by the undisputed fact that the judge was the sentencing authority, and also Page 67 of this record shows that roughly a third of the convictions were sentenced to life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.447" offset="4984945">The problem was, it appeared from the jury's perspective, as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out in his opinion in Beck, to be a mandatory one, because the jury wasn't told of the judge's later sentencing function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.421" offset="5032906">Our response to that is, fine, but according to Beck and according to any reasoned analysis, the verdict form requirement could have only two conceivable effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.045" offset="5071358">One would be at the guilt stage where, according to the historical information in earlier cases, it might impermissibly encourage the jury to acquit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.401" offset="5112736">Our response to that is, so what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.353" offset="5120573">Why should Evans be allowed to complain because his jury was impermissibly encouraged to acquit him?</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.507" offset="5141158">He was convicted in spite of the preclusion clause and not because of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.126" offset="5155682">The second conceivable effect would be at the sentence stage, where the fact that the jury had reached a sentencing decision that had been publicly announced before the judge came to making his decision could conceivably impermissibly encourage the judge to pronounce a sentence of death, something that was alluded to in Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.372" offset="5236661">Our position on that is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.138" offset="5243767">First of all, sentencing errors never have been held to invalidate otherwise reliable convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.644" offset="5273755">The Fifth Circuit in this case didn't just say, go back and resentence Evans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.088" offset="5355571">The second position on the mandatory verdict form requirement is that it could not conceivably have affected even Evans' sentence in this particular case, because at every stage of the proceeding Evans had asked to be executed, before he was captured, throughout the grand jury, the trial, and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.869" offset="5434669">Any other sentence was inconceivable, not only because Evans asked for it, but also because he expressed no remorse, and told everybody, the jury, the judge, everybody,</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.826" offset="5478451">So, basically what we say here is, even if the jury verdict form requirement was constitutional error insofar as the sentence was concerned, the record proves beyond a reasonable doubt, Chapman analysis, it was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.734" offset="5534144">There is also an alternative ground for affirming in this case... for affirming the conviction, reversing the Fifth Circuit in this case, and that's the guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.157" offset="5567789">Alabama has an unusual guilty plea in capital cases rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.359" offset="5584612">The guilty plea rule basically is that a guilty plea in a capital case is given effect, but the case must still be submitted to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.917" offset="5634872">A guilty plea plus evidence to support the jury's verdict of guilt equal a waiver on appeal of non-jurisdictional defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.522" offset="5669249">On appeal, the Alabama courts did in this case consider the constitutional issues about the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.259" offset="5700178">They had to in the process of determining whether there were any jurisdictional defects, because there's a two-step process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.715" offset="5730062">One, are there any defects, any unconstitutional parts of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.484" offset="5745109">If the answer to that is yes, then they have to say, well, are these severable or non-severable, because under Brady, the unconstitutionality of a severable part of the statute is waived, but in Alabama law and virtually every other law, if some part of the statute had been determined to be unconstitutional at the threshold inquiry, and then had been determined to be non-severable, then the entire statute would have fallen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.234" offset="5852106">The conviction would have been void ab initio, and the court would not have had power to convict and sentence Evans under the statute, and we would have conceded it was jurisdictional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.823" offset="5894424">That is why they approached that inquiry in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.061" offset="5911456">To the Fifth Circuit's holding that Evans' guilty plea did not waive the preclusion clause because it was limited to a waiver of antecedent defects, we have two responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.667" offset="5949804">Our first response is, the unconstitutionality of the statutory provision on preclusion clause existed from the time the statute was enacted, and was in existence at the time that the Evans case went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.592" offset="6005497">Therefore, it was an antecedent defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.176" offset="6015842">Secondly, even if it wasn't, under Menna v. New York, the effect of a guilty plea is to render irrelevant anything that is logically consistent with the factual guilt, and that does not stand in the way of factual guilt once it's established.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.249" offset="6388139">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think in order to get an adequate understanding of exactly what constitutional issues we deal with in this case, it's important to understand the framework of Alabama law as it applies directly to this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.360" offset="6452609">Two points need to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.393" offset="6460759">Under Alabama's capital statute, capital murder and felony murder are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.668" offset="6497853">Felony murder is first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.620" offset="6509660">It does not require a showing of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.989" offset="6531185">Capital murder, under the applicable decisions of the Alabama Supreme Court, require a specific showing of intent, leading to the present practice in Alabama that juries are instructed, where the evidence supports such instruction, that a defendant may be found guilty of capital murder if the jury finds that he intentionally killed a particular victim, or he may be found guilty of felony murder if that intent is lacking, and that is clearly the differentiating factor under Alabama law between felony murder and capital murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.409" offset="6744867">Chief Justice Burger, our position is really multifaceted on how that particular law fits this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.479" offset="6777050">We contend that there is evidence in the record, particularly in Mr. Evans' grand jury testimony, which indicates that had that grand jury testimony been presented to the trial jury, the trial judge would have instructed on the lesser included offense of felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.857" offset="6842565">It raises a factual question about the intent that Mr. Evans possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.076" offset="6859492">We do not say necessarily that these questions involve sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.130" offset="6883734">We only say that they involve questions of, would the trial judge have instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of felony murder, and under Alabama law, charges must be given which are supported by any evidence, however weak, insufficient, or doubtful in credibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.513" offset="7921213">--Let me go back to that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.498" offset="7929154">Again, the crucial difference between capital murder under Alabama law and first degree murder is the question of intent, but more importantly, Alabama has created a procedure that some other states have, certainly not the majority, for how to deal with capital defendants, and their way to deal with capital defendants is, always the case is tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.328" offset="8012537">You cannot plead guilty under Alabama law, and the case cited by both sides, the Protho versus the State of Alabama, is the decision of the Alabama court of criminal appeals indicating that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.302" offset="8064364">You cannot plead guilty under Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.187" offset="8075962">You are entitled to have a jury try the case, and you're entitled to have a jury fix the punishment in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.325" offset="8096442">Now, what that translates into is not some sort of empty procedure, but in fact that every case brought under a capital indictment in Alabama goes to a trial by jury, and that's exactly what happened in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.983" offset="8155061">In this particular case, the judge voir dired the jury, he sequestered the witnesses, he said no one could sit who could not be fair and impartial, there was argument of counsel, there was presentation of evidence, there was a charge to the jury, and there was an important part of the charge to the jury that I think is worth noting, and that appears on Page 44 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.129" offset="8235727">Judge Hoplander, who was the trial judge, charged the jury,</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.033" offset="8251296">"I can only tell you that in reaching your verdict, you may not take the simple approach and say, if the defendant admits he did it, we go no further. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.156" offset="8291838">"You must reach a verdict that is supported by all of the creditable evidence that has been presented to you in this particular case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.876" offset="8314722">So, even the trial judge did not see this as an empty procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.928" offset="8330918">The question then occurs, how does the Beck decision and the infirmity in the Alabama constitutional... pardon me, the Alabama death penalty law relate to this particular statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.469" offset="8373027">And the answer is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.671" offset="8381909">Beck identified a fatal flaw in the Alabama statute, that a jury was precluded from reaching a verdict on a lesser included offense that was supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.443" offset="8424958">It made the procedure in this case as infirm as the procedure in any other case, and that flaw applies to cases like this, because in every case in Alabama, even where there is an attempted plea of guilty, the trial must be conducted in a constitutional fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.440" offset="8504893">That's the clear ruling of the Alabama court and the clear ruling of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.284" offset="13536286">Their instinctive self-preservation argument boils down to the fact that because he didn't want to kill anybody unless he had to, and because he thought Nassar was going for a gun, somehow in Alabama that would give him a right to a lesser included offense instruction, that is absolutely, flatly contrary to Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.781" offset="13610264">Alabama law is that if you intend to kill somebody instead of accidentally, and it is in the course of one of the capital offense situations, it doesn't matter what the reason for it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.053" offset="13651433">The only time an Alabama court has ever been presented with somebody who had the temerity to argue, I was killing in self-defense in this robbery murder case, was Reiner v. State, which is an Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals decision in 1977, and they said, quite frankly, this is the most novel claim that has ever been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.014" offset="13719247">They dismissed it out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.316" offset="13728442">It is simply... Alabama law is simply clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.085" offset="13739518">There was no lesser offense evidence in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3402.787" offset="13750281">Well, the court of appeals said that it violates the fundamental notions of due process to say that he didn't present the evidence when there was a rule of law in Alabama that said there was no such thing as a lesser included offense instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.666" offset="13821856">Now, that is a brand of Wainwright against Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.034" offset="13843277">You are saying... He is arguing that I could have presented evidence but I was deterred from it, and the court of appeals said that denies him due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.540" offset="13989353">But in response to our argument in that regard they said, however persuasive this argument might otherwise be, we are foreclosed by "in every case" language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.961" offset="14019029">Our position here is that if this preclusion clause had any effect at all on Evans, it actually encouraged him to present lesser offense evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.102" offset="14067616">Through his own sworn testimony, he told everybody who would listen, from the grand jury, to the trial jury, to the DA, to the New York Times, I want to be free or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.040" offset="14107322">Let me go free or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.992" offset="14115159">I do not want to go to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.509" offset="14121220">The preclusion clause guaranteed him that if he followed a lesser offense strategy, he would have nothing to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.932" offset="14150895">He would go free or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.898" offset="14158731">Now, those are the cases they might be able to argue, and we would have a tough time rebutting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.002" offset="14179211">They will come up and say, will it enhance the risk of conviction?</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.954" offset="14191019">So that is why I didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.490" offset="14197184">Read Mr. Justice Stevens' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.306" offset="14204393">Our reply to that is simply, it is absurd for them to argue that he was so afraid of getting convicted of a capital offense by presenting lesser offense evidence that he actually went up there and admitted the capital offense and asked to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.631" offset="14253713">Their contention that the evidence would have supported lesser offense instructions had it been presented at trial is rebutted by the fact that the three Alabama justices who applied Alabama law to the record all found on the Ritter case on remand, the three dissenters found that there was absolutely no evidence to support any lesser included offense, and that none should have been given otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.996" offset="14347127">Chief Justice Tolbert concurred with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.031" offset="14359352">He said, I'll go with the majority, that "in every case" language seems to compel it, but don't get confused, lower courts, you don't have to give an instruction if there's no evidence to support it, implying that there wasn't in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.875" offset="14418702">Everybody who has ever reviewed it, Alabama has said, there is no evidence to support it, and we asked the Fifth Circuit, we said, if there is any question, don't muck up Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.015" offset="14463215">Send the question over to the Alabama Supreme Court, and they refused to do so.</text>
