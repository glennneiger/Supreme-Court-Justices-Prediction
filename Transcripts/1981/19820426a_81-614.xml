            <label>Mr. Robert A. Chaffin</label>
            <text syncTime="12.464" offset="191206">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.714" offset="196117">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.213" offset="206148">This is a case involving the interpretation of a very old seaman's wage statute, a statute that had its origin first in 1790 and later came to be known as what is known now as the double wage penalty statute, which took its present form approximately in 1872.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.596" offset="279708">That statute provides in essence, Your Honors, that if a seaman on a foreign voyage, such as the Petitioner was found to be by the trial court in this case, is not timely and properly paid his earned wages, those wages which are rightfully and uncontestedly due to him, one-third of those wages on the date of his discharge and the remainder within four days thereafter, that every master or owner who refuses or neglects to make payment without sufficient cause in the manner provided by the statute shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to two days pay for each and every day during which such delay shall continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.421" offset="466954">Your Honors, that is the heart of the case here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.732" offset="476254">In this particular case the trial court found uncontestedly that the seaman, the Petitioner, had been denied by the Respondent his wages, that he had made timely demand for his wages, and that even though demand had been timely made and with diligence he had pursued his demand, that the Respondent failed in an unreasonable manner, acted recalcitrantly, callously, willfully and wantonly and failed to pay the Petitioner his wages called for by the statute, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.203" offset="610105">I got lost a little bit in the arithmetic here, counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.170" offset="625988">What was the... in dollars, what were the actual dollars he lost for the actual days, apart from all the penalty provisions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Chaffin</label>
            <text syncTime="130.073" offset="661619">Your Honor, if I may regress to the facts just a little bit, the Petitioner was actually due on his discharge $412.50, the amount of money which had been withheld from his pay check and was to be paid to him when he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.177" offset="718043">The actual facts are, Your Honor, that the Petitioner was at work as a seaman on board the Respondent's vessel, which was the Lay Barge 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.220" offset="746151">He received injuries which were due solely to an unseaworthy condition of that vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.015" offset="769348">He had to leave the vessel to have minor surgery and to recuperate from his injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.779" offset="788469">He left the vessel, Your Honor, on April the 1st of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.636" offset="807904">At that time the Respondent had withheld from his paycheck $412.50 that was to be paid to him on the date of his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.430" offset="843013">He was not paid that money, Your Honor, and when he was discharged in the port of Rotterdam the trial court found that the Respondent acted unreasonably, callously, willfully and wantonly in disregard of his rights to receive those wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.440" offset="899124">Subsequently, the Petitioner attempted with due diligence, as the trial court found, to collect those wages, but was denied the wages, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.640" offset="931829">Now, the real thrust of this case, Your Honor, is not the validity nor the applicability of this statute, but the size of the penalty which the statute carries with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.401" offset="974879">If I may read to the Court the one sentence in the statute which I believe is the heart of the case, it reads, Your Honors:</text>
            <text syncTime="215.679" offset="1004032">"Every master or owner who refuses or neglects to make payment in the manner herein before mentioned without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to two days pay for each and every day during which payment is delayed beyond the respective period, which sum shall be recoverable as wages.

            <text syncTime="2192.432" offset="8911088">The Court of Appeals extended that penalty through the date of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.007" offset="8933344">When it got to the Supreme Court, the Court held that there was sufficient cause for taking the appeal and therefore period of the penalty would be... would stop as of the date of the district court's decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.517" offset="12575336">Yet... when you read that statute, the literal wording of the statute, you read it clearly, that's what it says and that's all it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.092" offset="12601668">Yet this Court in Reid against Yaka and in Jackson versus Lykes Brothers held that where a longshoreman is employed directly by a compensation-paying employer who is also a shipowner, then the shipowner is not immune from tort liability and the longshoreman may sue the shipowner directly for damages under the general maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.298" offset="12718487">Specifically, those cases held that he had a cause of action for damages for unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.281" offset="12734474">Now, that statute was amended in 1972 and the longshoreman's remedy for unseaworthiness was eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.949" offset="12769060">Since that time the appellate courts have held that the longshoreman nevertheless still retains his direct action against his employer under the principles of maritime negligence so long as the quality of the negligence that causes the accident is negligence in the navigation of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.660" offset="12851921">Courts have distinguished negligence in loading the cargo on the vessel, which is normally longshore work, and navigation of the vessel, which is operation of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.124" offset="12897792">And I cite those cases to you simply to reaffirm that, although the literal wording of the statute in question may say that the two days wages or the double wages are payable until paid, certainly this longshore statute shows clearly that this Court and other federal courts obviously have the right to interpret these statutes to divine the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.469" offset="13051183">I think the history of this statute indicates that Congress intended to turn its administration over to the federal admiralty courts, and if Congress had been dissatisfied with it it would have amended the statute, because for many years these cases have been on the books allowing the courts to exercise their discretion in determining the period of the penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.302" offset="15174520">The only equitable conduct in this case was that the Petitioner himself went out and found reemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.503" offset="15203359">Now, equitable conduct by its nature refers to some type of conduct that the Respondent in this case should have come forward with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.640" offset="15235855">Your Honor, the record is absolutely clean of any conduct on the part of the Respondent that they did anything to help the Petitioner collect money that was rightfully due him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.339" offset="15278696">In other words, the only equities in the case actually fall on the side of the Petitioner, with the exception of the one equity which the Respondent jumps on, Your Honor, and that's that it's a big penalty.</text>
