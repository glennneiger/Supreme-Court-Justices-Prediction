            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141507">We will hear arguments next in Ridgway and Prudential Insurance Company v. Ridgway.</text>

            <text syncTime="19.878" offset="220919">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="235966">I have attempted a number of times to state the facts in this case as a pure proposition of law in a single sentence, and I find that whenever I do it the sentence necessarily has six or seven commas and an equal number of semi colons, so I will attempt to do it by a brief reference to the facts and then develop the facts in more detail, followed by the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.445" offset="323215">At base, the question in this case is who to have the beneficial enjoyment of the proceeds of a Servicemen's Group Life Insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.568" offset="363757">The two claimants are, first, the beneficiary designated under the procedures provided for by the federal statute and regulations, and on the other hand, the serviceman's ex wife who claims the policy proceeds for the benefit of her minor children under a state court divorce decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.714" offset="444318">The facts are these: Richard Ridgway was a career sergeant in the Army ensured under the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance program, which I will refer to hereafter a the SGLI Insurance program, in the amount of $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.105" offset="501892">He was married to April Ridgway.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.390" offset="510983">They had three children, all of whom were minors at the time Sergeant Ridgway died.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.878" offset="532926">The marriage deteriorated.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.996" offset="541389">April and Richard Ridgway were divorced in 1977, and in the divorce decree Sergeant Ridgway was ordered to maintain in effect for the benefit of his minor children his life insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.487" offset="591440">The only life insurance policy he had at that time was his &lt;SGLI&gt; [= SGLI] policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.124" offset="609935">He did not do that, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.624" offset="615995">He subsequently married Donna Ridgway, the Co-Petitioner in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.743" offset="632400">Shortly thereafter he changed the beneficiary designation in the manner provided for on the military form which embodied an order of precedent set forth in the applicable statute and regulations of 38 U.S.C. 770(g)--</text>

            <text syncTime="191.605" offset="907835">Under a prior form of insurance, the former National Service Life Insurance program, such a document might possibly have been effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.278" offset="946601">However, in enacting the statutes and the regulations under the Servicemen's Group Life, the SGLI program, the manner in which beneficiaries can be created and changed is very specifically set forth by the statute and the regulations, and that requires that the beneficiary designation be in writing, signed by the serviceman and received by the appropriate military unit before the insured's death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.922" offset="5033092">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.041" offset="5045631">The Servicemen's Group Life Insurance program, which is the subject of this case, is an important feature of the United States Military Personnel Policy, which was adopted with the intention that it alleviate a unique hardship of military service, which is the simple fact that meaningful commercial life insurance is not available to servicemen protecting them against the thing that their loved ones most need, that is, the extra hazards of military service in combat conditions or other war hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.179" offset="5174154">The program was adopted to boost morale of service members by making available a safe, convenient, sure form of insurance protection for anyone that the service member might choose to favor with these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.855" offset="5232877">As of the moment, there are over 3 million Servicemen's Group Life Insurance policies in effect, and the insured service members live in all 50 states in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.096" offset="5285853">The United States has participated as amicus curiae in this case in this Court because it has substantial interest in ensuring that the proceeds of policies issued under this program are distributed in accordance with the intentions of the Congress, and it might be appropriate to suggest that in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question early out to Mr. Beale, that while we do not, the Government is not here speaking particularly for Richard Ridgway, I suppose that we are closest to that status in the sense that the interest of the United States is essentially the interest of service members generally.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1325.138" offset="5441961">When you say distributed with... in accordance with the intent of Congress, don't you actually mean with the intent, in accordance with the intent of the serviceman?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="1337.963" offset="5493265">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.547" offset="5495669">We read the statute, and we think it is quite plain on its face that what Congress intended is that whatever the service member intended be followed through so that the two merge in this case, in the instance where the service member has designated a beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.175" offset="5566199">In the government's view, the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine fails to accord proper scope and effect to two provisions of the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act which effectively grant each service member insured under this program the right to determine who should determine the proceeds of his, his or her insurance policy, and to insulate those proceeds from any form of collateral attack whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.008" offset="5681451">The first provision of the Act which is in our view significant here is the provision which provides, as I was just discussing, that the service member has the prerogative to designate any person to take the proceeds of the insurance, and there can be no question that Congress understood quite clearly that this was a broad leave to the servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.524" offset="5775597">On the floor of the Congress, Represent Everett as quoted in our brief, stated, this bill permits you to leave your insurance to your church, your college, or to your best friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.331" offset="5822826">Clearly Congress had no illusions as to the scope of the license accorded the service member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.085" offset="5845814">In so doing, Congress further went on to provide that if no designation were made, the proceeds be paid in the first instance to a widow or widower, in the second instance if no such widow or widower were available, to any surviving children or descendents of those children, then on to a parent, and finally, the last two options were to the executor or administrator of an estate or to any next of kin prescribed in accordance with state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.290" offset="5974650">But wasn't his designation of willingness to continue the policy in force for the children in effect an expression of willingness to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.900" offset="6029089">Well, that may well be, Justice Rehnquist, but it fails to accord with the statutory standard in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.387" offset="6058973">In the first instance, the statute provides that the designation, to be effective, must be received in writing in the service office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.076" offset="6093768">Furthermore, the regulations which were adopted contemporaneously with the initial enactment of the statute, and which are due some deference, have been continuously in force for fifteen or so years now, provide that the right to change the beneficiary is retained at all times, and we believe this is consistent with the statutory language which expressly provides that the benefits be paid to whomsoever he designates, and that therefore he has the right to change his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.429" offset="6215185">But whether or not that is true, the additional point which was raised earlier was the fact that this was not receiving in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.720" offset="6252384">In fact, although the record is somewhat unclear on this point and the government obviously has no view on the matter, it appears that there was not in fact, likely was not a written separation agreement, so there is failure to comply with the requirements of designation of intent in that respect, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.812" offset="6320720">Would the government's view be different if it had received the necessary writing required by the regulation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.003" offset="6361471">The government's view would be the same, but we would think it a closer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.239" offset="6374428">For instance, it might be reasonable... and we would think it might be reasonably done by Congress, if Congress deems it appropriate... Congress could provide that in the event that a separation agreement is entered, particularly if it were embodied in a divorce decree, that a registered copy, certified by the clerk of the court, duly filed with the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance office in Newark, New Jersey, providing that there be an irrevocable designation might have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.758" offset="6496472">Now, obviously those aren't the facts here both because that is not what occurred and that Congress hasn't done so, and we would think it is Congress's prerogative to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.964" offset="6529282">But in any event, there isn't a clear, written, unambiguous, final assertion of intent so that while we think the case is somewhat harder because of the oral separation agreement, we don't think that would be dispositive here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.020" offset="6777549">On the other hand, as an alternative argument, we would suggest that if... if the effect of a court order is to somehow limit that... and we would suggest that a state court doesn't have the power under the statute to so order... that may not be enforced against the proceeds of the policy, and obviously we have no information or view as to whether, whether there are other assets available here, but we think it is not a small point that a distinction be drawn between enforcement of his promise as opposed to imposition of a constructive trust on the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.778" offset="6924567">It seems to us that one of the things that is essentially different about this military service policy from other life insurance situations, putting aside the convenience of the insurer or anything such as that, is that it is a program intended for mass application for people sometimes serving overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.274" offset="6998545">It is intended to be simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.041" offset="7005651">Congress designed it so that one is presumptively enrolled unless one opts out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.011" offset="7025504">In the discussion in the legislative history you find references to things such as the fact that that was intended to cover POWs in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.367" offset="7058940">It was all intended to be very simple, cut and dried so that the serviceman might know that when he signed on this form that is provided by the military, which is within... a copy of which is within the record, that he could rest assured that that beneficiary would receive those proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.345" offset="7130829">And we would submit that the Maine court, in supposing that by getting the insurance company off the hook as they purported to view, took a very restrictive view of what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.820" offset="7180776">We would suppose that, all other things being equal, Congress would be more content to have Prudential litigating this than to have Donna Ridgway or people in her position faced with the burden of litigating this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.711" offset="7228318">We would suppose that part of what Congress meant was not only that there be financial security, but that this lawsuit not have occurred, and yet it obviously has, and therefore we share the view that a clear judgment of this Court having the effect that this insurance policy simply could not be an asset, could not be a chip in the bargaining in a separation agreement process would be beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.445" offset="7335211">The Respondents have suggested that that would be anomalous, make the insurance policy worthless and so on, but in many respects that would place this insurance on a similar basis... on a basis similar to other insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.253" offset="7386516">Other insurance may be cancelled for nonpayment of premiums, it may be cancelled because one is no longer eligible for health reasons, and it is, I think most divorce lawyers know, a very risky asset to take in a separation agreement, and contrary to what Respondents suggested, it would probably be beneficial were that clear to all counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.932" offset="7473138">And certainly a judgment of this Court to that effect would do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.403" offset="7491110">One other point I'd like to address is that there really can't be any question here that Congress was aware that it was superseding the application of state law in providing the right to designate the beneficiary by virtue of the fact that Congress did not simply ignore the existence of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.382" offset="7566970">In the table of order of precedence, down at the bottom, when you get to No. 5 and No. 6, referring to the executor of the estate or next of kin controlled by state law, those effectively incorporate state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.291" offset="7618588">So Congress, aware of what it was doing, placed state law down at the bottom of the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.545" offset="7643665">The government's interest in this case is obviously not identical with Sergeant Ridgway's, and we don't particularly have a brief for the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.651" offset="7688074">Our brief is obviously for the program, and we suggest that in general it would be best if the sanctity of the serviceman's designation were upheld in all respects, and that if, as Congress may deem it appropriate to devise a system whereby effect may be given to a state judgment, that is best fashioned by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.166" offset="7782114">In this regard, it might be worthwhile to point out that subsequent to the filing of the briefs in this case, Congress has adopted legislation which alters the result in Hisquierdo, doesn't overturn the Court's decision nor suggest that it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.878" offset="7845017">It creates a uniform federal solution under the Railroad Retirement Act which Congress deemed equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.698" offset="7872289">It is national in application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.734" offset="7880439">It does not turn on whether it's a community property state or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.019" offset="7893500">Obviously this is something the Court could not do, could not have done in Hisquierdo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.840" offset="7912831">And the newspapers also tell us that Congress is considering uniform national solutions to introduce some kind of equity for divorced spouses which would alter the result in McCarty but not suggest that it be overruled directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.699" offset="7980227">These are matters which Congress is clearly addressing closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.051" offset="7993706">It is much more within the province of Congress to make the kind of fine adjustments which would be appropriate, perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.025" offset="8037592">The judgment is for Congress in certain circumstances, but there seems to no need to subject the beneficiaries of a Servicemen's Group Life Insurance policy to the kind of constructive trust which was imposed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.551" offset="8099659">The Court in its recent decisions in Hisquierdo and McCarty has outlined a two step test for judging matters such as this which involve the question of preemption of state law relating to marital property when it is applied to a federal benefit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.132" offset="8178026">We would submit that on the facts of this case, both of those elements are satisfied because there is both a conflict between the state right based on state law which is asserted, and a clear impairment of the federal purpose sufficient to require that the state right not be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.259" offset="8250542">The purpose of the program as we understand it was to ensure that the serviceman's intent be enforced, and under the circumstances, we suggest that reversal of the judgment of the Maine court is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.923" offset="8337164">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.910" offset="8353047">I am sorry that I have to begin by apologizing for the numerous typographical errors in the brief which I discovered when I was preparing for this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.618" offset="8399963">Rather than taking the Court's time with simply detailing some of those which may be confusing, I propose to submit something to the Clerk within the next few days indicating those areas where there may be some confusion because of the typographical mistakes that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.810" offset="8460671">This was a case in which the serviceman made an agreement with his wife prior to a divorce, a fact which was not mentioned by Mr. Beale in his description of the facts, by which he committed himself to make his service life insurance payable to his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.410" offset="8555130">He accepted the benefits of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.044" offset="8569654">There were negotiations between the parties which presumably permitted him to perhaps make lower support payments, and then he subsequently refused to honor it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.250" offset="8614480">He consented to the entry of a divorce decree which made his obligation to make these insurance proceeds payable to his children part of the court order, and he later ignored that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.612" offset="8679891">I think that on these facts... well, I should add also that finally his second wife, Petitioners argue, is entitled to retain the proceeds even though they were certainly a windfall to her and a result of her husband's illegal act in defiance of the court decree and his own agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.560" offset="8771737">Now, on these facts, I think we're entitled to ask what overriding policies are there which would compel this Court to reach the result which I would characterize as totally absurd and unfair.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.272" offset="8850523">Well, Your Honor, I don't really believe that the Supremacy Clause is at issue here because I don't believe there's really a conflict between the state law in imposing constructive trust, and the federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2217.432" offset="9011228">Well, we have taken the position that he is free and that a state court order to the contrary would be superseded by the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.906" offset="9065040">It is conceivable, however, that Congress did not intend to carry the authorization to servicemen that far, and that the intention was solely to permit changes of beneficiaries where this would not be in contravention of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.301" offset="9130660">However, the right to change the beneficiary is still subject to all of the common law doctrines which have clearly over the years made it clear that the beneficiary of a... of insurance policies such as this may not keep the proceeds where to do so would be to result in unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.592" offset="9287812">Now, several of the Justices asked the attorney for Prudential a question which has been puzzling me, which is, why are they here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.098" offset="9325847">The administrative inconvenience argument is difficult for me to follow since the Maine Supreme Court made it clear that the constructive trust theory applies only to the proceeds in the hands of the beneficiary, so that the insurance company may safely pay the beneficiary in every case unless they are subject to some court restraint directing them not to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.217" offset="9634300">Now, I would also raise a question as to the interest of the United States in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.704" offset="9660318">The Solicitor General's brief begins with a section entitled Interest of the United States, and in that portion of his brief he indicates that the purpose of the servicemen's life insurance program is in part,</text>

            <text syncTime="2405.771" offset="9764495">Now, in examining the interest of the United States, we must keep in mind the fact that as the Court said in Hisquierdo, local law dealing with family law problems will be followed by this Court unless</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.365" offset="9830950">"there is major damage to clear and substantial federal interest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.952" offset="9857282">The Solicitor General's brief does not explain why there is any damage to federal interest as a result of the holding of the court below, and what objectives will be frustrated by that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.278" offset="9914542">I find it hard to imagine that any prospective enlistee in the military services would be dissuaded from doing that if he were told by a recruiter that we offer a program of group life insurance at low cost, but I must warn you that if you intend to defraud your dependents at some later time, under the holding of the Maine Court and the Supreme Court of the United States you will not be able to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2886.565" offset="11687734">This Court... excuse me, the circuit courts have held, and I think perhaps this Court has held under somewhat similar circumstances that when a person who murders the insured is not entitled to the proceeds of the policy on equitable principles, and in the Sixth Circuit, held under language which was identical to that in the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance, this being language dealing with federal employees, which has the same language in it about the right to designate beneficiaries, that the murderer could not receive the proceeds of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.523" offset="11847499">Now, suppose in this case Donna had been told by Richard that he wanted to change the beneficiary back to the children and he gave her a form to send to New Jersey which would have accomplished that, but she surreptitiously destroyed it and did not do what he wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.971" offset="11937360">This is a case where unclean hands on the part of the claimant, Donna, would bar her under well recognized decisions from collecting the insurance proceeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.575" offset="12059718">Now, suppose in our case that Donna had agreed with Richard, again supposing he had second thoughts about changing the beneficiary designation, that she would hold the proceeds for the benefit of his children and would make sure that they received them, and he died subsequently, believing that that would be the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3944.043" offset="15917585">Yes, they did in effect, and they not only declared that the remedy of a constructive trust would potentially be available, which the Superior Court had decided was not even available for it to consider because of the Supremacy Clause issue, the Maine Court went beyond that and sua sponte imposed the constructive trust on the proceeds without even remanding to the Superior Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3972.647" offset="16032002">But the central point is that I think that in contradistinction to what the Maine Court held, that Donna Ridgway was not unjustly enriched, in short, that holding is wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="4012.705" offset="16192289">As to the Supremacy Clause question, that the real issue here is not whether the Supremacy Clause applies or not, and whether there's a preemption issue, but how far the preemption extends.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.793" offset="16232622">The Respondents' argument would have the Court hold that the preemption argument extends only to the mechanical payment of the proceeds to the designated beneficiary, and that the federal preemption then stops and a constructive trust may be imposed on the proceeds in the hands of the designated beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.172" offset="16302108">Well, that's a hollow argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.141" offset="16310049">It's clear that the intent here has to be that the federal preemption must extend to the beneficial enjoyment of the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.480" offset="16343381">That point is made in the Hisquierdo decision, it's made again in the McCarty decision, that what is really at issue is where the beneficial enjoyment of the proceeds ends up and not the mere mechanical payment.</text>
