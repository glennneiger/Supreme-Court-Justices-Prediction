            <text syncTime="93.926" offset="510240">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this proceeding arose out of a pro se complaint filed by the Respondent under 42 USC 1983 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, November 5th, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="616506">That complaint alleged various claims against the Petitioner Martha Shepard in the Polk County Offender Advocate's office against the Polk County Board of Supervisors and against the entity of Polk County.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.687" offset="677319">Respondent alleged that Petitioner Shepard had failed to properly represent him on appeal of his conviction for first degree robbery in the District Court of Iowa in and for Polk County to the Iowa Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.214" offset="743357">He claimed that her actions in failing to... in failing to represent him properly in that... in that appeal had deprived him of his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, and imposed upon him cruel and unusual punishment, and had arbitrarily denied him his state-created right to appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court from its conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.449" offset="848369">He also asserted claims for... for legal malpractice and for breach of an oral contract to prosecute the appeal to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.939" offset="898315">The Polk County Offender Advocate was also named.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.009" offset="922557">The Board of Supervisors of Polk County and Polk County itself were named, alleging that they were responsible for Ms. Shepard's action because they had adopted established rules and procedures for handling such appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.353" offset="983997">His complaint sought injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.138" offset="999148">It is of monetary damages and release from confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.590" offset="1012940">The District Court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Petitioner Shepard and the Offender Advocate did not act under color of state law, that the complaint did not allege the requisite personal involvement of the Polk County... members of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, or of the Polk County Offender Advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.388" offset="1108130">It construed his request for... for release to be a petition for habeas corpus, and found that he had not exhausted his state remedies, and therefore dismissed that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.786" offset="1185662">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the decision of the District Court, finding that the county employed the public defender, and that a county... county employed public defender does act under color of state law, because the public defender in that situation is selected, paid, hired and fired by the county, that the public defenders have their power because of the fact that they are employed to represent indigent defendants, and not because they have been selected by the defendants for whom they are providing representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.815" offset="1369773">Having decided that the county employed public defender is... is involved in state action, then the Court of Appeals ruled that the county employed public defender enjoys only a qualified immunity, and further, that as a matter of pleading, that the Respondent had stated a 1983 claim against the Board of Supervisors and the Offender Advocate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.250" offset="7511579">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I agree with Justice Marshal that the place to begin the analysis of this case is with an examination of the relevant statute under which the Public Defender's Office was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.509" offset="7572601">In Iowa, we have an Iowa Public Defender Act which is found at Chapter 336(A) of the Iowa Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.329" offset="7599872">Under this particular statute, the county supervisors of a particular county or group of counties if they so choose can decide by resolution to form a Public Defender's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.053" offset="7654730">The office is created by the supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.541" offset="7672702">They determine a budget for the supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.158" offset="7687226">They ask the district judges of the county to nominate certain individuals who would be well qualified to serve as a public defender, and the county supervisors select the individual from that particular list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.418" offset="7748248">The county supervisors are given the responsibility of defining the term "indigency", which thus gives them the power to decide which individuals will be eligible for representation by the public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.964" offset="7814390">In addition to this... these responsibilities, it is the responsibility of the public defender to submit an annual report to the Attorney General of the State of Iowa, to the chief judge of the judicial district in which he practices, and also to the county supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.758" offset="7889623">The supervisors are given the opportunity of terminating the office at any time that they deem appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.829" offset="7913864">It seems clear, and it was acknowledged by the Eighth Circuit that this, the extensive involvement of the local county supervisors in the Public Defender Office means that the public defender himself and his or her assistants become inextricably linked to the political process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.219" offset="13063435">This issue is of interest to the United States because the language in Section 1983 referring to color of law, color of statute is the precise language, is parallel to the language in Section 242 of Title 18, which provides criminal sanctions for anyone who willfully subjects a person to the deprivation of constitutional rights while acting under color of law, and this Court has construed the color of law language in Section 242 to be... Given it essentially the same scope as the color of law language in Title... in Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.046" offset="13226752">In this case, the principal conduct complained of by Respondent was the alleged failure of Petitioner Shepard to adequately represent him on appeal of his state conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.055" offset="13294775">Respondent further alleges that this inadequacy was due to or pursuant to policies adopted by the offender advocate and by... apparently by the Board of Supervisors of Polk County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.946" offset="13350364">As described by Mr. Hudson, the county... the Polk County Offender Advocate's office is established pursuant to a state statute that calls for the establishment of county public defenders's offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.372" offset="13415983">In this case, the offender advocate was appointed by the Board of Supervisors, is entirely funded by the Board of Supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.293" offset="13443673">It seems clear, then, that the Polk County Offender Advocate's office is an agency of Polk County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.833" offset="13481917">Indeed, the chapter of the Iowa Code that authorizes counties to establish offender advocates' offices is entitled county and township government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.939" offset="13522354">So, acting pursuant to the state statute, the county has established an office of county government for the purpose of providing function... defense to indigent defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.799" offset="13581704">Moreover, in this case, the conduct complained of was the inadequacy of Petitioner Shepard's representation of Respondent on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.006" offset="13622560">The relevant provisions of the Iowa statute expressly require the public defender, once he is appointed, to represent... to defend and counsel the defendant, and to represent him at all stages of his subsequent post-conviction remedies, including appeal or other remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.301" offset="13703748">So, in this case the county employee involved, the assistant public defender, was discharging her duties under county ordinance and state law when she filed the Anders brief or the alleged Anders brief that Respondent complains of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.214" offset="13783370">It would seem indisputable that a state employee, or the actions of a state employee undertaken in the course of the discharge of her official duties under state law is properly attributable to the state, and therefore would be state action for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.628" offset="13865081">Given this, it would seem equally indisputable that those same actions would be taken under color of state law for purposes of Section 1983, which was passed to enforce the restraints on state action imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.340" offset="13935925">Indeed, this Court in United States versus Price said that in cases under Section 1983, the element of color of law has been treated as the same thing as the state action requirement for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
