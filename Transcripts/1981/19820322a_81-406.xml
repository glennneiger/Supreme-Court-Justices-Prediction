            <text syncTime="100.600" offset="402390">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this argument is presented on behalf of the Constitutional Board of Trustees which administers and sets policy for all higher learning in the state of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.858" offset="479399">The case reviews a holding that any single-sex campus for females is unconstitutional, absent the maintenance of a single-sex campus for males.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.461" offset="545750">It is not limited to any narrow holding with respect to nursing programs, but it applies campus-wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.285" offset="589113">The defendant Board of Trustees operates eight university campuses in Mississippi in different locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.374" offset="629447">Seven of them are co-educational, and one is female.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.981" offset="651912">The Board of Trustees sets the policies and decides which universities may award which degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.148" offset="700500">I would like to say at the outset that we are not here to perpetuate a nineteenth century finishing school to teach young women needlecraft and kindergarten keeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.908" offset="767582">Mississippi University for Women is a contemporary university which tries to prepare women to meet the challenges of today.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.840" offset="811259">Our opponents have said that MUW offers such programs as fashion modeling and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.602" offset="850338">It also offers, in accordance with the bulletin which has been introduced, Air Force ROTC, computer sciences, accounting, pre-dentistry, pre-medical education, pre-law, and other such courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.392" offset="913554">I think it is interesting to look for a moment at the history of this institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.826" offset="947304">It was the first state-supported institution for the higher education of women in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.668" offset="974576">It was founded in 1884 after the University of Mississippi had become co-educational, so it cannot be said that it was founded for the purpose of relegating women to some inferior school.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.115" offset="1032359">On the contrary, as the bulletin indicates, it was the result of the efforts of a woman named Salley Renault and a number of other very progressive women of that era seeking higher education for women.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.341" offset="1125355">Do we know what their reason was, if the University of Mississippi was then co-educational?</text>

            <label>Mr. Hunter M. Gholson</label>
            <text syncTime="285.213" offset="1140820">--I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the reason was that women perceived a special need for some of them for education especially tailored to the needs of women, and I would certainly say that not all women perceived this need.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.270" offset="1209051">Neither did they then, nor do they today, but our argument is that under the theory of federalism, if it is not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Mississippi should be permitted to allow women who want single-sex education to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.732" offset="1278851">Now, Mississippi used to have a single-sex higher educational institution for men, but that no longer exists, and I think the answer is, it no longer exists because the demand no longer exists, but the demand continues for single-sex education for women, and we believe that this option is Constitutionally permissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.392" offset="1549479">Where will the Department of Education be left in the administration of funds under Title IX as to which Congress has made a specific single-sex undergraduate exception?</text>

            <text syncTime="643.429" offset="2573688">We would certainly submit with respect to the burden of proof, which is an issue which has been brought up in the briefs, that Mr. Hogan filed his suit and he proved that he was denied admission because he didn't meet the qualification of being a woman, but he did no more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.139" offset="2668460">He took discovery, his counsel did, and in this discovery, both the depositions of Dr. Strobel, the president, Dr. Harvey Kraft, the vice president for academic affairs, and other representatives of the university were taken, and live testimony was taken at the preliminary injunction hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.912" offset="5563559">The Title IX argument which I mentioned a moment ago is not that Congress can change the Constitution, but that in a number of cases, most recently, I think, Rostka versus Goldberg, this Court has indicated an interest in deferring in certain areas to the expressed and rationed conclusions of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.649" offset="5682573">In making the Title IX exception, it is very clear that Congress intended to continue to appropriate money for state supported and other single-sex institutions that traditionally were so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.096" offset="5744327">Congress certainly couldn't intend to appropriate money for an unconstitutional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.951" offset="5771703">So, the view of Congress at least has been clearly expressed in this regard, and I wonder what the Title IX fallout could be if the Fifth Circuit's opinion is permitted to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.430" offset="5837636">Will we next be facing challenges of whether we have co-educational versus single-sex dormitories, or where those dormitories may be located with respect to convenience to the students, whether or not we could have co-educational versus single-sex athletic programs, and if a student has a right to participate in such a program that is only available to one of another sex?</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.120" offset="5960411">So, I think that this case bears considerable interest and effect Constitutionally, not just for this single institution but in the administration of the Title IX program at large, and if I may, I will reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.473" offset="6181825">The question is not whether Joe Hogan may attend nursing classes at the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.487" offset="6209933">Indeed, he can attend and participate fully in classes, and theoretically he could audit a complete course load.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.545" offset="6250162">Indeed, the president of the university said at Page 62 of this transcript that he could theoretically audit a complete course load.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.948" offset="6287778">Joe Hogan testified on Page 26 of the transcript that he was told that he could audit as many classes as he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.664" offset="6330619">The question is not whether single-sex schools are per se violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.267" offset="6368967">The court of appeals did not make such a holding, and Mr. Hogan has never requested such a ruling from any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.123" offset="6412434">The question that the defendants have recently presented is whether this is affirmative action for women, and in their brief they use specifically affirmative action for women, and I would point out to this Court that throughout this litigation, and at the district court level, the defendants invited the district court to use the low scrutiny, the low scrutiny of Williams versus McNair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.250" offset="6556944">They invited the court of appeals to use that same level of scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.653" offset="6578573">It is only when they get to the Supreme Court that they now admit that Craig v. Boren gives the proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.899" offset="6619533">We never heard anything regarding affirmative action for women as a purpose for the W, as they call it, at the trial level.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.172" offset="9508676">The vice president for academic affairs, the dean of many schools, the director of admissions personnel, extended services, the library, the great, great weight of leadership has been by men, and indeed, how can they provide the role models that Mrs. Tidbolt points out?</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.565" offset="9642214">The studies that they have referred to have no relationship to this particular school.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.047" offset="9828101">Mrs. Tidbolt did not testify, and we value cross examination, because we would question her analysis substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.137" offset="9880451">Looking at the problem from another vantage point, the inquiry as to a compensatory purpose is not even appropriate until there is a showing of past discrimination and continuing effects of that discrimination as to women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.204" offset="9976790">We have... There has been no showing by the state of Mississippi, and the burden is upon them to make the showing, that their system has discriminated against females, and that they must take this extraordinary step in order to correct that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.242" offset="10064875">Further, they would have to show that in the area of nursing, there had been discrimination against women, and that the W exists to correct that past discrimination, and that it is necessary to bar men from that program to further that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.934" offset="10179709">Again, I must constantly return to the record, for it was our conclusion from the beginning of this litigation that the burden was upon the state to support their gender classification, and every holding by this Court since 1973 has said that, and clearly the state has not met their burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.238" offset="10264869">If there are unique opportunities to be offered to women in an educational atmosphere, there was no showing by the state that it could not be done in a co-educational environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.598" offset="11482384">In response to that, I would refer to the language of Mr. Justice Brennan in Frontiero versus Richardson, beginning with the statement,</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.564" offset="11518224">"There can be no doubt that our nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.373" offset="12173479">I don't think that you can read Dr. Strobel's testimony or Dr. Kraft's testimony and conclude that they are describing anything less than a program of very positive affirmative action to help women fulfill their full potential in today's society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.897" offset="12255504">It is certainly true that, as has been mentioned in the other argument, that the plaintiff stopped short when he filed his suit and said, I have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.329" offset="12317257">He listened to Dr. Strobel, he listened to Dr. Kraft, he saw the references to the educators who endorsed their theories, and he did nothing to refute that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.115" offset="12576392">The language of the 1884 enabling Act sounds a good bit like the kind of language this Court might have used in Muller versus Oregon, which was a little later, in 1908, and it spoke of the need of women to achieve a greater parity with her brother, who was the superior animal, and things that were very Victorian in phraseology, and not the kind of thing we would say or believe today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.195" offset="12700735">But I think the important point is that MUW has evolved with the times, and the question is, what are they doing today to help women in education, and is Dr. Strobel right?</text>
