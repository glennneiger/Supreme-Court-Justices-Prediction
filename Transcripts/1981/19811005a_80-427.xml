            <text syncTime="72.361" offset="418623">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.095" offset="425519">May it please the Court, in 1974, David and Lynn Cassilly bought a new home in St. Louis County, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.171" offset="457806">In 1975, they with other citizens of St. Louis County initiated a series of litigations in the state court system to attempt to obtain a reassessment of real property taxes in St. Louis County and in the state of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.334" offset="538473">A series of decisions by the state courts have been rendered on that subject and a process of reassessment is now under legislative and court mandate going forward in the state of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.235" offset="598032">In the middle of the process of raising the issue of reassessment in the state of Missouri, the Cassillys, together with a citizen organization in which they were involved, initiated this action, a 1983 action, in which they sought damages against certain state and county officials for what they viewed as a violation of their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.611" offset="723628">Particularly, they alleged two violations of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.908" offset="740765">First, they alleged that they had been placed in a category of classification of homeowners that was separate from homeowners in general, that is, new homeowners, and that as new homeowners their real property was assessed at the rate of 33 and a third percent of its fair market value when other homeowners were assessed on average at a prevailing market rate of approximately 22 percent of its fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.769" offset="864167">Secondly, they alleged that in the course of appealing certain assessments over the years, and particularly in one particular year, they were successful in their appeal and their assessed value was reduced, but that they and everybody else who had appealed in that year through the state process had been automatically called up for reassessment in the second year, thus that they were put in a classification of people who had exercised their right to appeal and when people exercised their right to appeal they were separated into a separate class and subjected to a reassessment that raised them back to where they had been assessed in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.937" offset="1216925">While one of the Petitioners is an association of citizens, this Act... this lawsuit has been determined solely on the basis of the Cassillys' claim, and the question that we come down to is the interest today of these homeowners in their right to pursue their 1983 action in light of the Tax Injunction Act in Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.841" offset="1556517">In Petitioners' complaint, they allege damages in excess of the amount of tax refund, and I am speaking specifically about the Cassillys, wholly aside from Fair Assessment in Real Estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.990" offset="1625062">We have assessed both excessive taxes and other monetary damages in some of the years of the complaint and punitive damages, and seek to recover those.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.485" offset="1671037">I think that when we have the discussion from Judge Nangle, when he says this is like a tax refund action, I think we should recognize another element of his decision, and that is, he said compared to Younger against Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.696" offset="1739896">Without much analysis of what that meant, he was suggesting, I think, that the difficulty in this case is the difficulty of Federalism, that it is a question of whether the Federal Courts, the lower Federal Courts should hear a Section 1983 action at law for damages in the context of a claim that the entire process is a part of the state taxation process, which is obviously terribly important to keep within the confines of state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.583" offset="1935501">That is right, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.706" offset="1947935">In Great Lakes against Huffman, the Court confined itself to the subject of declaratory judgment actions, which was the question presented, and our tradition is to recognize that declaratory judgments actions are not quite equity actions but certainly are in the realm that is somewhat similar to equity actions, and indeed the argument that I would present to this Court, is that on the language and the legislative history and the precedents, like the Great Lakes case itself, that on all of those terms, that Section 1341, the Tax Injunction Act, bars the Federal Courts from hearing cases in which the claim is for the exercise of anything in the order of equity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.543" offset="2171335">But I likewise submit that there is nothing in the statute or the legislative history or the precedents to suggest that the claim for damages should be barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.194" offset="2225878">Well, Mr. Newburger, before we ever had 1341, I gather the jurisprudence of this Court was, at the very least, wasn't it, that you had to do administrative exhaustion, administrative exhaustion in the state, and that that was a jurisdictional prerequisite to a tax suit, was it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.275" offset="11566221">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.320" offset="11578446">There are a couple of points that I would like to specifically address that the Justices raised in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.271" offset="11602270">If I might, Justice O'Connor, address the question that you asked first, don't we think that Congress really wasn't thinking about injunctions, I must admit that there are two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.048" offset="11645320">First of all, we have specified these two cases at Page 16 of the reply brief, in which the Courts quite clearly took the view that a damage action could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.779" offset="11688265">I think that Congress could have found those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.292" offset="11698296">Whether they found them or didn't, I don't know, but that leads me perhaps to the second most important portion of the answer to that question, and that is that Congress very clearly established the jurisdictional bar, and specified with specific words what the jurisdictional bar was going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.113" offset="11761617">The jurisdictional bar was against actions or suits, rather, to enjoin, suspend, or restrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.284" offset="11790247">It says nothing about actions for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.689" offset="11799860">I think the language of the statute is terribly plain, and under those circumstances I think if the bar is to be extended because of policy considerations, that it should be extended by Congress and not the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.651" offset="11855762">That brings me to the question that Justice Blackmun raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.712" offset="11876033">What speculation can one have for why the Eighth Circuit evenly divided on the question?</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.366" offset="11898603">And I think that what... and I, if I may, will exercise the discretion to speculate myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.316" offset="11926397">I think that the telling argument that makes the case terribly convincing on behalf of Petitioners is that there is no precedent in the comity cases, and there is no way to read the Tax Injunction Act to draw the conclusion that this action should be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.261" offset="12010198">The comity cases have confined themselves to areas of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.947" offset="12024931">This is not an equity action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.259" offset="12030156">The Tax Injunction Act, as I suggest, is plain on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.179" offset="12049800">Well, what was the concern?</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.226" offset="12054084">Why was it a four-four split?</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.849" offset="12060562">I submit that the reason that it is a four-four split is because we are raising a troublesome question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.410" offset="12086789">We are suggesting that the Federal Courts in some way may become involved in reviewing what is going on in the state assessment processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.186" offset="12129839">I submit that that concern, however, was overstated or overworried in the Eighth Circuit for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.106" offset="12161604">First of all, this is not an effort to take money from the state coffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.462" offset="12178949">It is an action against individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.167" offset="12185846">Second, there are all kinds of good faith defenses that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.197" offset="12205908">If we get to the merits and we can't prove what we are saying, we are going to lose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.697" offset="12355955">That's right, Your Honor, but the point that I would make in light of that, when one talks about our worrying about being in the state processes, if what we are going for is simply a new political process or a new policy process within the state, we would not undertake the burden of proving palpably arbitrary classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.468" offset="12455011">The question, if we are going to the future policy of what is going to go on to the state, we will do that in the state Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.981" offset="12489075">We have done that in the state Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.761" offset="12500151">What we are saying here is that in the course of going through the process of raising the question in the state Courts, these people became mad at us, and they took out after us, and in the course of doing that they violated our constitutional rights, and we have a right under Section 1983 to obtain the Federal Court protection of our constitutional rights if we can show that they purposely set about to violate those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.891" offset="12608716">If we can't prove that, then we can't prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.327" offset="12618433">We ask the Court to send us back and give us our day in Court so that we can demonstrate that we can indeed prove that.</text>
