            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="135947">We will hear arguments next in United States against MacDonald.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.482" offset="165831">Mr. Horowitz, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="59.039" offset="372094">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.879" offset="415457">The primary question presented here, and the one which I will devote most of my attention to in argument is simply whether the speedy trial clause applies to a period when a person is under no form of restraint and has no charges pending against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.874" offset="471359">There are also two subsidiary questions presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.123" offset="484420">First, if the Court rejects the government's view that the speedy trial clause is not applicable to such a period, it is our contention nevertheless that the application of the Barker v. Wingo factors in this case demonstrates that there was no Sixth Amendment violation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.225" offset="548786">Second, Respondent contends as an alternative ground for affirmance that in any event the pre-indictment delay here violated the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.784" offset="587029">The background of this litigation is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.502" offset="601867">On February 17th, 1970, Respondent's wife and two children were bludgeoned and stabbed to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.155" offset="628512">Respondent called the military police, and when they arrived at the crime scene, he told them that he had been attacked by a group of intruders and knocked unconscious, and that when he regained consciousness, he discovered the bodies of his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.852" offset="683265">Respondent, who gave investigators a detailed account of his actions upon regaining consciousness, was originally viewed as a victim of the crime, not as a suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.738" offset="722866">However, as the investigation proceeded, and the investigators came to realize that the physical evidence at the scene of the crime was inconsistent with several aspects of Respondent's story, he did become a suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.265" offset="772917">On April 6th, 1970, Respondent was advised that he was a suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.919" offset="795591">He was relieved of his duties as a physician and confined to his quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.122" offset="812414">On May 1st, 1970, he was charged with murder under Article 30 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and pursuant to Article 32 of that code an investigating officer was appointed to investigate the charges and recommend whether they should be referred to a court martial for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.707" offset="882736">After a hearing, the investigating officer recommended that the charges be dismissed for lack of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.016" offset="915963">On October 23rd, 1970, the commanding general of Respondent's unit accepted the recommendation and dismissed the charges on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to warrant convening a court martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.761" offset="958909">In December of 1970, Respondent was honorably discharged from the Army, and shortly thereafter he moved to California and established himself as a practicing physician.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.410" offset="1041560">At the Justice Department's request, the Army Criminal Investigative Division continued its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.595" offset="1074265">CID submitted a massive report on this investigation to the Justice Department in June of 1972, and in response to further specific inquiries for investigation from the department, it submitted supplemental reports in November, 1972, and August, 1973.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.676" offset="1186592">I understand that parts of it are in the record and are lodged with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.018" offset="1203937">A grand jury was convened in the summer of 1974, and Respondent was indicted in January of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.125" offset="1240404">Respondent filed several pretrial motions in 1975 to dismiss the indictment, including motions to dismiss on speedy trial and double jeopardy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.667" offset="1282514">When the district court denied these motions, Respondent took a pretrial appeal to the Fourth Circuit, which ordered the indictment dismissed on speedy trial grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.647" offset="1318458">In 1978, this Court vacated the Fourth Circuit's decision on the ground that the denial of a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds could not be appealed before a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.111" offset="1364329">On remand, the Fourth Circuit rejected Respondent's double jeopardy claim, and this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.531" offset="1390034">The case was then remanded to the district court for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.217" offset="1404767">After the district court denied a pretrial speedy trial motion, and the court of appeals denied a petition for writ of mandamus, Respondent's trial commenced in July of 1979, and he was found guilty on three counts of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.086" offset="1460251">He again filed a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds after the trial, which was denied by the district court, and on appeal the court of appeals held that Respondent had been denied his right to a speedy trial, and that the indictment should have been dismissed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="376.631" offset="1642376">Yes, Judge DuPree wrote an opinion which is reprinted in the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.987" offset="1667872">I believe it is Pages 56 to 63 that are relevant, and he found that he had been carefully watching during the trial for any signs of prejudice, and that there was no prejudice at all as a result of the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.575" offset="1718236">I should note that the court of appeals opinion found that the primary part of the delay that it considered ground for dismissal of the indictment was the two-year period between the submission of the CID report to the Justice Department and the convening of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.163" offset="1788558">Now, the critical period here for this Court's attention is the period between the dismissal of the military charges in October, 1970, and the return of the indictment in January of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.954" offset="1839758">That is the period over which the parties are in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.921" offset="1851565">Respondent's contention is that his speedy trial right attached during this period, one during which no charges were pending against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.480" offset="1885838">That conclusion, we submit, is at odds both with the language of the Sixth Amendment and with the policies underlying the speedy trial clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.039" offset="1916035">The Sixth Amendment provides,</text>
            <text syncTime="447.414" offset="1925544">"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="452.303" offset="1945083">And it then goes on to enumerate several other protections that an accused is entitled to in the course of criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.048" offset="1976117">Now, during the period after dismissal of the military charges, Respondent was not the subject of the criminal prosecution, nor was he the subject of a public accusation, and hence could be called an accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.950" offset="2031705">Thus, by the express terms of the Constitutional provision, he had no right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.886" offset="2055425">Indeed, the right makes no sense in this context, because the government cannot reasonably be required to speedily try a person on charges that do not even exist.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="537.956" offset="2287705">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as I mentioned before the break, we believe that the speedy trial clause is not applicable to this period by its express terms, because Respondent was not accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.917" offset="2355519">This is quite clear from this Court's decision in Marion, where the Court specifically focused on the question of when a person becomes an accused such that a Sixth Amendment speedy trial right attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.382" offset="2401390">The Court explained at Page 320 of its opinion in Marion, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="570.645" offset="2418527">"It is either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge that engaged this protection. "</text>
            <text syncTime="581.499" offset="2461890">Here, the government agrees that Respondent's Sixth Amendment right did attach when he was held to answer a criminal charge filed under Article 30 of the Code of Military Justice, but the government's Constitutional obligation was completely satisfied, and the pendency of this speedy trial right was necessary extinguished by the speedy dismissal of that charge and Respondent's release from all restraints on his liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.628" offset="2594383">Well, the government was freed of its obligation under the speedy trial clause, but that doesn't mean that it was freed of its obligation to try to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice, so they continued to investigate the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.715" offset="2654778">They felt that they had enough evidence that they were still under an obligation to try to prosecute.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.228" offset="2700858">Certainly they were considering prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.851" offset="2707336">As long as there was an unsolved crime, they were considering prosecution.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="646.975" offset="2723846">Mr. Horowitz, there is some comment in the briefs about a change in the testimony of two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.471" offset="2761776">Do you have any comment on that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="659.581" stopTime="804.380">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="659.581" offset="2774210">Well, I think we have explained in our reply brief that, first of all, the one witness really didn't change his testimony, and explained why his medical opinion had changed; the second witness explained why she could not recall what she had been asked about when she was first interviewed, and then later did recall in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.273" offset="2856966">Neither one of these has anything to do with delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.538" offset="2870027">First of all, the speedy trial clause really doesn't protect the defendant against the strengthening of the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.442" offset="2897612">What it protects him against is prejudice to his defense because of the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.706" offset="2910674">When the charges against Respondent were dismissed, the criminal prosecution was terminated, and there was no charge left to which a speedy trial claim could attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.342" offset="2957276">Now, Respondent argues that his case is markedly similar to that of Klopfer versus North Carolina, and I think it is instructive to address this contention, because in our view it is the differences between this case, the situation of a defendant against whom no charges are pending, and the situation of the defendant in Klopfer that are significant for Sixth Amendment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.115" offset="3044316">Under the state procedure used in Klopfer, the defendant was subjected to an unliquidated criminal charge for an indefinite period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.581" offset="3078171">The state simply took a pause in its prosecution of the defendant, a pause that could have lasted indefinitely, and it was free to pick up the prosecution again at any time right where it left off, simply by calling the case for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.542" offset="3134073">Moreover, the statute of limitations was tolled during this period, and thus it was effectively eliminated as a protection for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.976" offset="3163748">Here, by contrast, the government could try Respondent only by beginning a prosecution from scratch that is, by convening a grand jury, convincing the grand jury to return an indictment, and all of this would have to be done within the statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.893" offset="3531447">In Marion, this Court discussed the policies that are the subject of a Sixth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.656" offset="3558510">A formal charge brought by the state is a public accusation that the government has probable cause to believe that the accused has committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.449" offset="3593723">This public accusation entails certain adverse consequences to the accused, and I would like to examine those adverse consequences as listed by this Court at Page 320 of its opinion in Marion, and that is reprinted in our brief at Page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.959" offset="3655686">In our view, it is clear that these consequences are dispelled by the dismissal of the charge, just as surely as they would be dispelled if the accused had been brought to a speedy trial on those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.751" offset="3702915">Hence a dismissal must terminate the applicability of the Sixth Amendment guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.780" offset="3722977">The first interest identified by the Court is that the public accusation seriously interferes with the defendant's liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.198" offset="3756727">This is perhaps the most important interest protected, because it is the one that is unique to the speedy trial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.070" offset="3784208">Once a charge is brought, the defendant is under some restriction on his liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.630" offset="3802389">Even if he is not incarcerated, he would probably be released under certain conditions of bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.395" offset="3821511">Of course, in this case, this interest is not applicable at all, because defendant was completely released when the military charges were dismissed against him and he was honorably discharged from the Army.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.043" offset="4668087">The lingering anxiety that he still has over the possibility that he may still be prosecuted is no different than what the defendant in Marion had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.604" offset="4698285">I think just as the policies underlying the speedy trial clause militate against Respondent's position, so, too, do considerations of the sound administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.332" offset="4745201">As this Court explained in Lovasco, there are important reasons for permitting the prosecutor to exercise his discretion as to whether and when to institute criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.078" offset="4784176">These considerations are equally applicable if the charge has already been filed and dismissed, and as we explained in our brief, there are many legitimate reasons for a prosecutor deciding to dismiss a charge that has already been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.355" offset="4833286">Now, the filing of a criminal charge against a defendant, particularly for murder, is a decision not to be made lightly or hastily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.930" offset="4867663">As this Court stated in Lovasco, the fact that a prosecutor takes a long time and carefully considers whether to bring such a charge is an exercise of principles of fair play and decency, not in opposition to those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.032" offset="4923983">The administration of justice is advanced if a prosecutor is free to exercise his discretion without the threat of the severe sanction of dismissal of the indictment for all time hanging over his head if he does not act with what a court with the benefit of hindsight later determines to be sufficient expedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.057" offset="5000156">Now, the Respondent has suggested in this case, at Page 19 of his brief, that he does not necessarily insist that there be a general rule applying the speedy trial clause to a period after dismissal, but he does contend that the protection should apply to this period in his special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.253" offset="5072881">He does not really explain what factors justify a special exception for him, and indeed, we contend that whatever special aspects there are to this case argue even more forcefully against applying the speedy trial clause here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.981" offset="5127843">First, the charges were brought by a different prosecuting authority, by the military, so there is not the same specter of the same prosecutor making a mistake, bringing charges, and then dismissing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.695" offset="5170683">Second, he was never indicted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.726" offset="5182804">And third, and perhaps most important is the extraordinary severity of the crime involved here, which should argue against a special exception for speedy trial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.112" offset="5224391">I would like to emphasize, however, that it is important that there be a general rule on which prosecutors can rely in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.499" offset="5257932">Prosecutors are entitled to know when making the charging decision whether the speedy trial time is running against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.028" offset="5284055">They should not have to be exposed to the possibility that a court will later decide that a particular case calls for an exception, and a sort of retrospective application of the speedy trial clause to a period where the prosecutor would not have expected the time to be running.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.272" offset="5341002">This general rule, we suggest, is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.802" offset="5355108">It is the one that was stated by this Court at page 313 of its opinion in Marion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.426" offset="5373603">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a person who is subject to a public accusation the right to a speedy disposition of the charges pending against him, no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.452" offset="5413727">Now, this case has a narrow focus, and that is the applicability of the speedy trial clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.168" offset="5436610">Of course, we recognize that a person has legitimate interests concerning the possibility of prosecution even when no charges are pending against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.025" offset="5472032">But our system of justice provides other protections for those interests, not the speedy trial clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.319" offset="5497214">For example, a person has an interest in repose against the possibility that charges will eventually be brought against him, or that stale charges will be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.331" offset="5533263">The statute of limitations, as this Court has said many times, is the protection for that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.235" offset="5556878">He also is entitled to protection against unfair pre-indictment delay or government misconduct, but the due process clause protects him against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.809" offset="5595121">And, of course, he is entitled to protection against a second prosecution once a first prosecution has advanced to a certain stage, but the double jeopardy clause is the source of that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.710" offset="5642768">These protections are adequate to serve their purposes, and there is no need to supplement them here by wrenching the Sixth Amendment from its proper context to apply to a situation when no charges are pending against the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.019" offset="5695954">I would like to turn briefly, if I could, to the subsidiary questions that are raised by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.109" offset="5724375">On Respondent's contention that he is entitled to a dismissal under the Fifth Amendment, we think this contention is insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.435" offset="5753632">There is clearly, by Respondent's own admission in this case, no intentional or unfair government delay in this case, and therefore there can be no Fifth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.288" offset="5793025">Moreover, as discussed in our brief, there was no actual prejudice to the accused's defense at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.584" offset="5814236">With respect to the Sixth Amendment question, which this Court need reach only if it rejects the government's primary contention that the speedy trial clause does not apply to this period, we suggest that the delay between the dismissal of the charges and the return of the indictment was justifiable, and should not be held against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.639" offset="5898455">It must be remembered that this was an extraordinarily complex case that required detailed analysis of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.089" offset="5928234">The court of appeals itself recognized that there was no undue delay in the preparation and submission of the CID report up until 1972, and it took the Justice Department time to digest the material in this report and to decide whether a case could be made against the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.628" offset="6002422">Moreover, a murder charge is a very serious matter, and it was the government's position, as it should be, that it did not want to charge the Respondent with the murders unless it felt it could obtain a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.967" offset="6047771">There were certain... There were obviously certain factors which Respondent has pointed to in his brief that made it at least questionable whether a conviction could be obtained in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.023" offset="6100016">They had to worry about the decision made by the Article 32 hearing already, which had held there was insufficient evidence to convene a court martial, an the fact that the case was essentially circumstantial, and that there was no obvious motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.972" offset="6155813">Finally, I should point out that, contrary to Respondent's suggestion, this careful consideration and time that the department gave to the case was not in... excuse me, was not in opposition to the desires that they expressed for a prompt resolution of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.339" offset="6233240">Now, there are letters that Respondent's counsel sent to the Department of Justice asking about the case asking about its status, asking that it be dismissed because of his innocence, and wondering what was happening.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.089" offset="6388303">Rather, they asked that it give careful consideration to all the factors before deciding to proceed with an indictment, and unfortunately, these letters were in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.153" offset="6532499">"it at all possible to take whatever steps you feel appropriate to ensure that Dr. MacDonald's case is carefully evaluated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.524" offset="6561965">This letter was written in April of 1973, which was already into the time period that the court of appeals suggested the government should already have indicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.864" offset="6599372">The court of appeals' suggestion essentially is that as soon as the government got this report, it should have run in, convened a grand jury, and indicted him, but here you have, in the middle of this period, Respondent is still asking for careful consideration by the government before reaching such a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.904" offset="6659558">Another factor in the Barker analysis is the prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.855" offset="6683278">I think the prejudice to the defense is adequately discussed in the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.303" offset="6745136">Now, I think it is important to step back and consider what the Court of Appeals has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.425" offset="6765616">A man has been convicted of a brutal crime, the murder of his wife and two children, after what this Court must assume to have been a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.047" offset="6800097">Nevertheless, he has been set free forever, never to answer for that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.295" offset="6817025">This has been done because the government took great care and time to consider his case before deciding to charge him, and an appellate court has determined with hindsight that the decision could have been reached in less time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.746" offset="8074873">I think the Court put it that arrest triggers the provision even though there has been no formal indictment, and so our case so far as the Sixth Amendment is concerned rests upon the proposition that there had been an arrest, that Dr. MacDonald was held under restraint, that this public accusation caused wide notoriety and public obloquy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.445" offset="8277687">As with many other Constitutional protections, so also, I think, of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of speedy trial, when a public act is taken by the sovereign, protections that weren't previously available come into play, and I think Marion makes quite clear, I think the government doesn't disagree, that the speedy trial provision was activated by the arrest and the restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.104" offset="8404329">Rather, it contents that it was deactivated during an interim period between the dismissal of the initial indictment by the military and the pre-indictment by the civilian authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.053" offset="8600143">As to the substantiality of the delay, it was a delay of close to two and one-half years after the investigation and the re-investigation and a sixth month period to report the result of the investigation had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.719" offset="8670778">As to that two and a half year period, both panels of the court of appeals found that it was inexcusable, that nothing was taking place, that the department was letting the case lie on the shelf, that it reflected, in the words of Judge Murnaghan below "a calloused and lackadaisical attitude" and was irresponsible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2346.991" offset="9523833">In this case, the court of appeals found that there was an inordinate delay, that there was no justification for it, that the effects of the initial charge continued unabated, that they caused stress and obloquy, and further, and I mean to develop the question of prejudice, that the long delay resulted in serious impairment of the defendant's ability to defend against the charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.316" offset="11281142">Dr. MacDonald, when the military police arrived following his call for help gave a description of the four intruders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.906" offset="11323565">One of them, he said, was a woman; the other three, males.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.686" offset="11346657">He described the woman as having blonde hair, wearing a white floppy hat... this was February, mind you... and boots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.759" offset="11394931">He described one of the other men as a black male wearing an Army type field jacket with sergeant stripes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.129" offset="11436414">Based on that description, a Fayetteville police officer who was called into the case prompted by the military police decided that he thought he knew who that woman was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.155" offset="11488554">That officer, an officer named Beasley, had used Helene Stokley as a drug informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.980" offset="11523767">Helene Stokley was the daughter of an Army colonel at Fort Bragg who had left home promptly after graduating from high school, had entered the drug culture in Fayetteville.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.272" offset="11572982">Beasley went to Stokley, because he knew that the description that Dr. MacDonald gave seemed to answer her description, and he knew further that her close friend and associate was a black male who typically wore an Army type field jacket with E-6 stripes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.605" offset="11670367">Promptly when he went to see Stokley, she admitted... I said in the brief it is a hedged admission, and I think that is a fair characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.070" offset="11716133">She said, I had it in my mind that I was there, but I was heavy on mescaline, which is, of course, a narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.486" offset="11757825">Two or three days later, Helene Stokley's neighbor, one Posey, who had seen her returning to her home at about 5:00 a.m. on the morning of February 17th, and the crime took place during the hours between midnight and 5:00 a.m., Posey spoke to Helene Stokley, and she told him that she had held the light during the commission of the crime, but that she herself would not kill anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.051" offset="11900140">Dr. MacDonald had told the military police when they arrived on the scene that the female intruded had a flickering light on her face as if she were holding a candle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.905" offset="11951549">Some time later, Stokley was interviewed by an Army CID agent named Brisentine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.463" offset="11997733">She told Brisentine that she had been involved, and she spoke of blood on the bed, and the words "kill the pigs" had been written on the headboard of the bed in the MacDonald home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.677" offset="12046634">She told him further that she would name the participants in this crime if granted immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.814" offset="12075160">She was not granted immunity, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.782" offset="12087072">Stokley in all made admissions to seven different out of court auditors, acquaintances, friends, law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.962" offset="12163767">Many of these admissions, in fact I think I might say all of these admissions, were fragmentary, and she would immediately equivocate for reasons that are obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.956" offset="12215699">She would make an admission, apparently impelled by the feeling that she needed to relieve herself of her feelings, and then she would promptly turn around and say, well, I won't say any more, I have already said too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.778" offset="12279020">Let me now turn to the finding of the court of appeals with respect to Stokley's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.836" offset="12319248">The court said that the failure of Stokley to verify, because Stokley when she took the stand claimed she no longer remembered what had happened on the night in question, the failure to verify Dr. MacDonald's account from the witness stand may well have been disastrous to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.387" offset="12445472">Had she testified, Judge Murnaghan goes on,</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.154" offset="12728535">Of course, there are other possibilities, but the credibility of Stokley's story was for the jury, had she testified, and the Court has made a finding here that a probable cause of her not appearing to testify before the jury, at least as to these matters, was the long delay for which the government was responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.348" offset="12825292">Now, it is perfectly true also that there is another possibility, that she may have been feigning when she was called into the public forum a lack of memory as to these events, because she did remember where she was at midnight, and she did remember returning to her home at 5:00 a.m., so it appears that she was abroad during this five hours when the crime took place, and nobody has ever offered any innocent explanation of that activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.705" offset="13158719">She was called a witness, and she claimed she could no longer remember ten years later what had taken place, and she denied any recollection of all the out of court statements that she had made to the various auditors who heard those admissions against interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3655.605" offset="14758354">I don't think it serves any purpose to really discuss here whether Helena Stokley committed these murders or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.071" offset="14784163">I would like to say one thing, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.445" offset="14793671">This contention was never raised in the district court at all, or on the first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.302" offset="14817077">It was raised for the first time on appeal in 1979, before the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.300" offset="14833064">I suggest to you that it is not quite the obvious prejudice that the Respondent suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.797" offset="14855111">In fact, I think, as we pointed out adequately in our brief, and as the dissenters in the court of appeals suggest, there was absolutely no prejudice at all in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.763" offset="14890951">She testified shortly after the crime, she stated, rather, shortly after the crimes that she didn't remember where she was because of drugs, the same thing that she said at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.525" offset="14925955">There is just no support in the record for any finding of prejudice to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.196" offset="14940688">Second, there is also no support in the record for finding that the Justice Department was indifferent during this period when it was deciding whether to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.115" offset="14976319">In fact, the record indicates that the case was always under active consideration by the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.580" offset="14998262">Of course, nothing happened in the sense that an indictment wasn't brought until it was decided, but that is because there was an internal dispute in the department as to whether the evidence was sufficient to get a conviction, and the department took its time in deciding that... until it decided that it finally could get a conviction and to bring the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.557" offset="15070151">In response to what Mr. Justice Brennan said before, there are grounds for remand to the court of appeals, but if this Court decides the due process question there are no grounds on which the indictment could be dismissed by the court of appeals, the only grounds on which a new trial could be ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.052" offset="15136084">With respect to... getting back to the Sixth Amendment question, I think it is important to point out that the prosecution does not avoid the speedy trial guarantee by the expedient of dismissing the indictment and then reindicting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.483" offset="15189792">The period during which the indictment is pending is always countered with the speedy trial guarantee, so you can't just dismiss the indictment and then go in the next day and get a new indictment, and evade the speedy trial clause that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.010" offset="15231901">I suggest the prosecutors have better things to do than to go out and get indictments and then dismiss them and then wait ten years and get another indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.819" offset="15263144">That just doesn't happen unless there is a good reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.474" offset="15273802">Finally, I would like to point again to this letter from Mr. Malley with respect to Respondent's contention that the adverse effects of the charge were continued unabated during this period when no charges were pending against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.217" offset="15348721">In this letter, as I pointed out, he asked the government to consider, carefully consider before bringing an indictment against him, and he points out that during the period since the military proceedings ended he has been getting his life back together, and then he goes on to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.102" offset="15408280">"Some of the things you must consider is any sort of formal attempt to accuse him again will result in devastating publicity, enormous financial loss, and personal humiliation to him. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.394" offset="15457495">Thus, Respondent himself has recognized that there is a big difference between the period when no charges are pending, after they have been dismissed, and a period when a formal charge is pending.</text>
