            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141666">We will hear arguments first this morning in Woelke and Romero Framing, Incorporated, against National Labor Relations Board, and the consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.512" offset="187642">Mr. Prager, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Prager, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="15.870" offset="205091">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, these consolidated cases are here on petitions for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.253" offset="262665">The en banc court below affirmed the Labor Board's decision that the construction unions involved in this case did not violate Section 8(b)(4)(A) of the Labor Act by picketing to obtain certain restrictive union-only subcontracting provisions which are commonly called subcontractor's clauses because both the court and the Board believed that such provisions were protected by the construction proviso to Section 8(e) of the Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.803" offset="388784">Two questions are thus presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.646" offset="400174">First, are subcontractor's clauses always valid under the construction proviso simply because they are contained in a lawful collective bargaining relationship between the union and the employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="76.876" offset="449075">Second, can a union lawfully picket to obtain such clauses?</text>
            <text syncTime="82.279" offset="470704">We believe the answer to both questions is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.543" offset="487736">We hope to persuade the Court that the Labor Board's decision and the court below's decision is contrary to the legislative history to Section 8(e) of the Labor Act, and contrary to the reasoning of this Court in Connell Construction, which was decided by the Court in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.050" offset="569865">The facts of this case are fairly straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.566" offset="579896">The Petitioner, Woelke and Romero, had a collective bargaining relationship with the unions, and in 1977, as the most currently contract to which it was party was about to expire, engaged in bargaining for a successor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.873" offset="633082">During the negotiations, the unions proposed the subcontractor clauses for Woelke and Romero to execute.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.058" offset="661816">Woelke and Romero refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.119" offset="670071">An impasse in bargaining developed, and in support of the union's provisions, the unions picketed various job sites to which Woelke and Romero at that time was working.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.223" offset="714479">Woelke filed appropriate charges with the Labor Board, and this litigation ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.877" offset="737153">First, I think the Court should understand what kind of subcontracting provisions these are.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.874" offset="761082">These are not provisions which restrict subcontracting simply to the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.294" offset="790757">In other words, these provisions prevail upon the employees and employers outside the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.072" offset="817924">Thus, these provisions clearly do not say that Woelke and Romero may not subcontract work or may not subcontract work if its employees are on layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.535" offset="867766">These provisions simply tell the employer which employers it may otherwise do business with.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.377" offset="899113">They apply to the work only of the contracting union.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.859" offset="913010">They name the particular union with which the subcontractor must be party.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.780" offset="932758">They apply to all job sites of the contractor or subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.638" offset="948118">They apply to all tiers of subcontracting, and they apply in futuro to all job sites without regard to the presence or absence of union members on particular job sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.665" offset="996288">They apply to the entire geographic area covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and they simply do not do anything other than to assist the construction unions who are party to the clauses in their organizing attempt in that geographic area.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.048" offset="1069849">Thus, in order for a subcontractor to be eligible to compete for the contractor's work, he must agree to sign the same exact union contract to which the contractor is party, and that subcontractor's employees must designate the particular union that is mentioned in the subcontractor clause in order for their employer to be eligible to do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.411" offset="1171308">We believe that these kinds of clauses have serious antitrust and labor implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.395" offset="1191162">Although this is not an antitrust case, the Court should recognize the breadth of the boycott that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.579" offset="1219896">The contractor is precluded from doing work... or the subcontractor is precluded from doing work unless he is party to that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.841" offset="1260961">The boycott extends beyond what we believe is any legitimate union purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.855" offset="1281023">The clauses seek to regulate the working conditions and the market area of the construction union involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.570" offset="1311847">As this Court noted, labor policy does not require that a union have freedom to impose direct restraints on competition among those who employ its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.738" offset="1356569">We believe that that is what these clauses in effect do.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.441" offset="1371406">Further, the labor policy implications of these clauses are that the union in effect has a broad top-down organizing tool which is contained in the union contract, which again, we believe, is contrary to the Connell decision of this Court in 1975, and contrary to the legislative intent in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.226" offset="1470567">In 1959, Congress passed Section 8(e) to the Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.740" offset="1492615">It added that section to the Act with the purpose of trying to prevent secondary boycott agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.267" offset="1526678">In 1958, this Court in its decision in Sandor had held that regardless of whether or not a voluntary agreement contained in a collective bargaining agreement conducted a secondary boycott against other people, the union could not use coercive pressure to enforce that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.118" offset="1610061">In 1959, in enacting Section 8(e) to the Act, Congress intended to interdict those agreements to conduct secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.771" offset="1652693">As far as the construction industry is concerned, however, Congress granted a limited exception to construction unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.611" offset="1688010">In doing so, they limited that exception to subcontracting or contracting of work at particular job sites and did not give construction unions otherwise a right to engage in organizing from the top down.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.994" offset="1749555">By definition, top-down organizing is used by the construction unions to organize the employer rather than the employees of that employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.506" offset="1795635">In other words, the union puts pressure on the employer to sign a collective bargaining agreement, notwithstanding the fact that the employer's employees may not want to be represented by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.438" offset="1843387">That kind of top-down organizing was interdicted both by Section 8(e), as far as most other industries are concerned, but also by other Labor Act provisions, specifically Section 8(b)(7) and also by strengthening Section 8(b)(4) of the Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.166" offset="1910260">To the extent that the construction proviso to 8(e) gives the construction unions an exemption, it would be contrary to that legislative intent to permit top-down organizing by that proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.192" offset="1966371">Rather, since the construction proviso to Section 8(e) was intended in part to overrule this Court's 1951 decision in Denver Building Trades, it is clear in our judgment that the proviso to Section 8(e) only exempts those otherwise secondary provisions which would be within the prohibition to Section 8(e) which are related to the Denver Building Trades' interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.976" offset="2085490">What are those interests?</text>
            <text syncTime="489.287" offset="2098760">Those interests are to prevent the alleviation of the job site tension on particular job sites that may develop between union and non-union workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.188" offset="2154348">But it is only those particular job sites at which union and non-union workers are working where that job site friction may develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.763" offset="2192696">Therefore, unless the union has an identifiable dispute at a particular construction project where and when union and non-union workers are working side by side, there is no legitimate interest sheltered by the proviso that should give a construction union the right to engage in this kind of broad boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.644" offset="2284229">A construction union does not need a top-down organizing subcontracting restriction in order to alleviate that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.641" offset="2320174">It does not need to require the contractor to specify to the subcontractor which union that subcontractor's employees must designate as their bargaining representative in order to be eligible to compete for the work at that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.992" offset="2389555">Our adversaries, the Respondents in this matter, argue that the construction industry proviso had more than one purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.223" offset="2422469">They argue that Congress intended by their proviso to preserve a pattern of collective bargaining which they say existed prior to 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.454" offset="2463429">We do not believe the legislative history or this Court's previous decision in Connell supports that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.280" offset="2490701">Rather, this Court apparently dismissed that argument in 1975, for that argument is based solely on one small reference in the legislative history by Senator, later President Kennedy, in which he said that the proviso was added to avoid serious damage to the pattern of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.816" offset="2588922">There was no further expression in the legislative history, in any of the committee reports, as to that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.688" offset="2624344">Completely opposite to the Labor Board's interpretation of the purpose of the proviso is the manner in which the proviso was added to Section 8(e).</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="632.167" offset="2670319">Mr. Prager, before you get to that, can I ask you, do you dispute the suggestion by your adversaries that this type of clause was prevalent in the construction industry prior to 1959?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_w_prager_jr" startTime="643.428" stopTime="838.819">
            <label>Mr. John W. Prager, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="643.428" offset="2715354">We dispute that it was a pattern that this clause was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.222" offset="2742522">We acknowledge that the construction unions, even as far back as 1941, had such provisions in some contracts throughout the United States, but the number of such contracts is by far very small, a few contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.669" offset="2808246">The board relies upon a study called the London Study, which was done in 1961, two years after the statute was passed, which found that some clauses did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.384" offset="2851191">The general counsel of the NLRB, in reviewing that study in 1976, concluded that there was no pattern, that the most that could be said was that there was a mosaic of types of subcontracting restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.518" offset="2907720">The Labor Board now argues, however, that that mosaic somehow or other has been transformed into a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.515" offset="2935723">We disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.734" offset="2940530">The Labor Board also argues that the clauses must be valid in order for construction unions to maintain the continuity of fringe benefits and to protect the job opportunities of construction workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.884" offset="3001134">That may be a very laudatory goal, but it is not one that finds any support in the legislative history to the construction proviso to Section 8(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="726.831" offset="3048990">If a construction union needs to protect its job opportunities, it can do so without the broad restraints involved in these kinds of subcontractor clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.843" offset="3092980">It can negotiate, for example, to preserve job opportunities, that a construction employer shall not subcontract work ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.558" offset="3131850">Now, perforce, that preserves the job opportunities of the bargaining unit employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.430" offset="3159331">It can negotiate a provision that says, as long as a majority of the work force of the contractor's employees are working, the employer may subcontract out work, but if that subcontracting will produce another layoff so that less than a majority of the bargaining unit would be working, subcontracting would be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.311" offset="3258910">The simple fact of the matter is that broad top-down organizing clauses which name particular unions as the beneficiaries of those clauses are not necessary to preserve job opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.290" offset="3318783">Furthermore, the work preservation test that this Court has previously adopted indicates that such kinds of work preservation goals are primary goals, goals which are not within the scope of the prohibition to Section 8(e) in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.376" offset="3391090">If Section 8(e)'s proviso is an exception to the secondary thrust of Section 8(e) overall, then the preservation of job opportunities can be done by provisions which are not within even the general scope of Section 8(e) of the Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.230" offset="3458486">In other word, the preservation of job opportunities has nothing whatsoever to do with Section 8(e) or the purpose of the proviso to that section.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.216" offset="5134502">Now, the general contractor, Connell Construction Company in that case, did not itself employ any plumbers at any time on any of its jobs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.987" offset="5233558">Now, if Connell Construction Company had itself employed just a couple of plumbers on just one job for just a couple of months, and if Plumbers Local 100 had put the very same subcontractor's clause in a full labor contract covering just those two plumbers, then, according to the rule of the Labor Board and of the court below, that subcontractor clause would be lawful, and it would apply at all times on all jobs of Connell Construction Company throughout the life of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.906" offset="5409206">Furthermore, according to the rule of the Labor Board and of the court below, Plumbers Local 100 could picket Connell Construction Company to force Connell to agree to that clause, the very same clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.229" offset="5466570">Now, the effect of that same subcontractor clause at all times on all of Connell's jobs except for just that two-month period on that one job where Connell employed the two plumbers would be indistinguishable from the effects of the subcontractor's clause in Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.329" offset="5562910">At all such times, the subcontractor clause would operate as a broad organizational weapon, organizing from the top down the subcontractor's employees by use of a secondary boycott, and at all such times without any redeeming virtue based on the close community of interests at the particular job site involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.415" offset="6427250">That's right, and it is my understanding it was presented and considered and rejected by the Court in Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.365" offset="6455044">The Labor Board and the court below seek to distinguish Connell on the ground that there was no collective bargaining relationship between the general contractor, Connell, and the union, whereas in our case there is a collective bargaining relationship between the general contractor and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.448" offset="6563400">The error in this position is demonstrated by looking at the very tenuous and insubstantial nature on many occasions of a collective bargaining relationship, and the very broad consequences that under the rule of the Board and the court below attached to that collective bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.486" offset="6647514">This can best be shown, I believe, by looking at a very simple specific example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.624" offset="6672069">The labor contract between Local 701 and these AGC general contractors covers the operation of every conceivable kind of heavy construction equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.494" offset="6719612">Now, a particular general contractor may himself employ members of Local 701 only occasionally and for very discreet purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.367" offset="6751064">For example, a particular general contractor may employ members of Local 701 only to operate forklifts on a particular job to move lumber for just a couple of months on that one job, and only on that occasion throughout the entire five-year life of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.095" offset="6809996">That particular general contractor may always, historically, and in every situation subcontract out all other work that involves the operation of heavy construction equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.668" offset="6864330">He at all times subcontracts out all the excavation work that includes the operation of a shovel and a front-end loader, subcontracts out all of the underground utility work that includes the operation of a backhoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.739" offset="6924621">He always subcontracts out all of the concrete laying work that involves the operation of a concrete pump, always subcontracts out the hoisting where operation of a crane is involved, subcontracts out all of the sprinkler fitter work that involves a mobile scaffold or a forklift uses the mobile scaffold, subcontracts out all of the landscaping work involving the use of other heavy construction equipment involved, subcontracts out all of the paving work and the driveway work involving the use of graders and rollers and pavers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.553" offset="7079788">Now, that general contractor does have a collective bargaining relationship with Local 701.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.860" offset="7117091">It employed a couple of its members on a job for a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.688" offset="7128376">The consequence of this, according to the Labor Board, is that the subcontractor clause is valid, and it applies at all times on all the general contractor's jobs throughout the five-year life of the contract, and that general contractor is prohibited from doing business with any subcontractor whose employees perform any of this work of operating any of that equipment unless that subcontractor has a labor contract with Local 701, and that labor contract requires all of the employees of that subcontractor performing that kind of work on any of the subcontractors' jobs throughout the life of the contract to be members of Local 701, and to designate Local 701 as their representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.479" offset="7335579">And furthermore, according to the rule of the Board, and of the court below, Local 701 can picket this general contractor to force him to agree to this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.146" offset="7390228">It is submitted that the legality of a union's right to top-down organize subcontractors' employees by means of a secondary boycott on all these other jobs at all these other times cannot reasonably depend on whether the general contractor employs at some time on some job one or two members some place of Local 701.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.336" offset="7522930">Surely, that is not what Congress intended, yet that is the rule of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.911" offset="7549261">This Court stated in both National Woodwork and also in Connell that the construction proviso is based on the close community of interests on construction sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.870" offset="7649049">That close community of interest on the construction site justifies the limited boycott which does intrude into employee and employer rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.145" offset="7706205">When Local 701's members are employed on a job site, they are a part of that close community of interests on that job site, but they are not part of the close community of interests on all the other jobs and at all other times when they are not employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.620" offset="7788125">The close community of interests on the particular job site which justifies Local 701's intrusion into the employee and the employer rights with respect to that site by means of a secondary boycott cannot justify the intrusion of Local 701 into the rights of employees and employers on other job sites where they are not a part, where the union and Local 701 are not a part of the close community of interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.215" offset="7930440">This subcontractor clause is not confined to those occasions where Local 701 is a part of the close community of interests, and therefore it is not within the purpose of the proviso, and so not within the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.504" offset="8015599">There can be no doubt, as this Court stated in Connell, that a major aim of Congress in 1959 was to limit top-down organizing by economic weapons, and there can be no doubt that this subcontractor clause is directly contrary to that major aim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.206" offset="8178394">It top-down organizes by virtue of an economic weapon, namely, the secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.892" offset="8205144">Furthermore, this clause cannot be justified by any of the special characteristics of the construction industry which Congress sought to accommodate in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.056" offset="8277868">This coercive boycott cannot be justified by the purposes underlying Section 8(f), which permits voluntary pre-hire contracts covering the contractor's own employees, and certainly this broad clause cannot be justified by Congress's purpose of avoiding job site friction between union and non-union workers because it is not confined to those occasions where such friction can occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.819" offset="9092889">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, Section 8(e), which was added to the Act in 1959, outlaws so-called hot cargo or secondary boycott agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.326" offset="9162897">The construction industry to Section 8(e) states, however, that nothing in this Subsection (e) shall apply to an agreement between a labor organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of work to be done at the site of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.130" offset="9254117">Now, as has been pointed out previously, read literally, the proviso's exemption for secondary subcontracting agreements plainly encompasses the agreements here since they relate to the contracting of construction site work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.512" offset="9339694">Normally, that should end the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.010" offset="9361637">However, in Connell, this Court indicated that the proviso may not be applied literally where to do so would be to frustrate Congress's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.926" offset="9413359">Therefore, let us turn to the legislative history and see that far from frustrating Congress's purpose, to interpret the proviso as the Board has done here as privileging the type of subcontracting clauses that we have here when entered into in the collective bargaining relationship, effectuates rather than frustrates Congress's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.005" offset="9561630">The Court may recall that Section 8(b)(4)(A) of the 1947 Act outlawed strike pressure against a neutral employer to force him to cease doing business with an employer with whom the union had a primary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.029" offset="9633728">This left certain loopholes in the Act's regulation of secondary boycotts, and as this Court recognized in Sandor, that although it was no defense to an unfair labor practice charge under 8(b)(4)(A) that the struck employer had agreed in advance to boycott a disfavored product, the mere execution of such a contract or its voluntary observance by the employer did not violate Section 8(b)(4)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.672" offset="9772282">This was regarded as a loophole, and the Landrum-Griffin bill, which passed the House, plugged this loophole completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.667" offset="9816272">It added a new provision which is the equivalent of the main body of the current Section 8(e) that made it unlawful for any labor organization and any employer to enter into an agreement whereby the employer agreed to cease doing business with any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.957" offset="9893490">Moreover, Section 8(b)(4)(A) was amended also to prescribe strike pressure, to force an employer to agree to such a boycott agreement because, as Representative Griffin explained in a passage that is quoted in our brief, although under existing law it was unlawful to strike to force a secondary employer to cease handling certain products or to cease doing business with some other person, the law, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.536" offset="10043746">"does not prohibit the same kind of activity to force such employers to sign contracts or agreements not to handle or transport goods coming from a source characterized by the union as unfair. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.732" offset="10100588">And indeed, in Sandor, one of the reasons why the Court held that the agreement was no defense to strike pressure to enforce the agreement was that the agreement itself might have been the result of strike pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.785" offset="10192748">So, these two loopholes, pressure to get an agreement and the agreement itself, were sought to be plugged in the Landrum-Griffin bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.624" offset="10236112">Now, there is little doubt that had the Landrum-Griffin bill been enacted it would have interdicted the clauses that we have here as well as strike pressure to get those clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.040" offset="10305806">When the House and Senate bills were referred to the conference committee, and incidentally, the Senate bill only banned hot cargo agreements in the trucking industry, the Senate conferees, led by Senator Kennedy, who was the chairman of the conference committee, insisted on exemptions from the ban on secondary agreements for the garment industry and for agreements relating to work to be done at the site of a construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.696" offset="10464422">The conference agreed to these changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.864" offset="10497023">Senator Kennedy, in his contemporaneous report to the Senate on the result of the conference, pointed out that the qualification for construction site subcontracting agreements, like the garment industry proviso, was necessary to avoid serious damage to the pattern of collective bargaining in the industry, and he went on to say that the construction industry proviso is intended to preserve the state of the law with respect to the validity of agreements relating to the contracting of work to be done at the site of the construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.471" offset="10683537">Agreements by which a contractor in the construction industry promises not to subcontract work on a construction site to a non-union contractor appear to be legal today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.653" offset="10728259">They will not be unlawful under Section 8(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.292" offset="10742783">And this is not the only reference to an intent by the construction industry proviso to preserve the status quo in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.083" offset="10805895">You find exactly the same statement in the House conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.440" offset="10831390">They don't talk about the pattern of collective bargaining in the industry, but they do make the point that these agreements in the construction industry appear to be lawful today, and the purpose of the proviso is to preserve that status quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.789" offset="13560768">That is totally different from the typical situation which we have in this case, where the union in seeking a subcontracting clause is seeking it as part of a completed collective bargaining agreement that governs the terms and conditions of employment of the contractor's employees, and it is because of the vital interest that this subcontracting clause has given the short term duration of jobs in the construction industry and the floating pool of workers that the unions of a particular contractor requires clauses of this sort in order to assure a continuity in their negotiated contract benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.029" offset="13981757">I wish to begin by stressing the fact that the proviso is not one stated in general terms, but one which deals specifically with the contracting and subcontracting of work at a job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.124" offset="14114146">Obviously, the very language shows a quite particularized intent to take out of the overall prohibition of Section 8(e) a particular type of agreement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="3581.589" offset="14467948">Well, the union's interests are dictated by the nature of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.710" offset="14508490">We point out, and the passages are quoted at Page 19 of our brief, that Congress at the same time it was considering Landrum-Griffin, whose main thrust was concerned with regulating internal union affairs, also had under advisement the provision which became Section 8(f) of the law, and which deals with so-called pre-hire agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.805" offset="14652791">And in their study of the industry, they noted the following major points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.692" offset="14688422">One is that the occasional nature of the employment relationship makes this industry markedly different from manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.892" offset="14725202">An individual employee typically works for many employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.624" offset="14740144">Moreover, a substantial majority of the skilled employees in this industry constitute a pool of such help centered about their appropriate craft union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.010" offset="14785702">Now, in terms of the union's interests, it is slightly different on behalf of those employees than the interest of an industrial union dealing with a particular employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.739" offset="14848605">The union knows that the employer is going to in all likelihood during the term of the contract discontinue particular work and move on to other work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.389" offset="14907119">What the union is concerned about, given the normal pattern of this industry in which subcontracting is prevalent is that the organized group of workers who are really attached to the union rather than to any particular employer continue to have opportunities to do the work that the union is negotiating about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.505" offset="14991651">If not, it is like trying to hold onto quicksilver without putting it in a container, because of the capitalization of these employers, because of the fact that work begins and ends frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.141" offset="15054136">If you don't preserve the work in general terms for this group of union employees, your collective bargaining agreement is going to have little or no value for those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.494" offset="15119547">Now, to be sure, one answer would be to say to the employer, that is it, no more subcontract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.819" offset="15140863">Given this industry, that just hasn't been the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.553" offset="15155805">Rather, the union's desire has been to make sure that whether that already organized employer does the work or not or whether somebody else does the work, its members, who are in... coming out of the hiring hall along with other people who may want to go through the hiring hall, get the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.575" offset="15235948">Without this kind of clause, unless you ban subcontracting, which would be completely against the whole grain and pattern of the way the industry has grown up, and the unions just haven't had an interest in disrupting that pattern, the collective agreement becomes of little or no worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.974" offset="15309509">That is why unions seek this kind of protection, and that is why, incidentally, as the very language at least of the opinion in Connell suggests, it is rational to posit a difference between situations in which the agreement is part of a collective bargaining arrangement and the situation in Connell where the agreement was designably outside of any collective bargaining arrangement in the hope of getting through a hole that that union had hoped had been created between Section 8(e) and Section 8(b)(7), which banned certain kinds of organizational picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.083" offset="15473976">In other words, in this situation, the union is seeking to advance the interests of those who have already made a free choice, a choice to join the union and to work under union contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.124" offset="15526117">It cannot do it in an effective way except by banning subcontracting, which would be contrary to the whole tenor of the industry--</text>

            <text syncTime="3978.460" offset="16055462">The answer is that there are such unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.506" offset="16071658">The operating engineers and the carpenters, the two unions that are involved here, are most likely to do that, because general contractors as the Woelke case shows... Woelke is a sub who does specialty framing work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.858" offset="16137068">General contractors use carpenters, or they may decide to use subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.184" offset="16162355">General contractors, as the argument on the other side indicates, may do certain kinds of heavy machinery operations themselves, and may decide not to do work of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.131" offset="16226094">The same thing is true with laborers, electricians, a variety of these crafts can work either for general or subs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.034" offset="16253784">Also, when you get down to the sub level, Woelke can give away part of the work it has, and may well do so, depending on how onerous it finds its collective agreement, how loosely the agreement binds it, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.902" offset="16317209">So you have general subs, sub subs, subs under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.041" offset="16337793">This is a very complicated series of interlocking relationships, and when you look at the debate concerning the Denver Building case, which was certainly one element of the consideration in 1959, Congress was well aware that you had these complex relationships leading to the construction of a single overall piece of construction, whether it be a building, a factory, a highway, and that there was an interrelation between these different generals and subs or people who were primary and secondary contractors, whatever you are going to call them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.084" offset="16529950">And part of the disquiet about the Denver Building case, and certainly a major drive was not simply union and non-union people don't work very well on a single job together, but also with this very problem that we are discussing, that if you organize a general contractor, or you organize a subcontractor, given the prevalence of contracting out in this industry, and given the nature of these companies, which form, reform, create joint ventures, and so on, the unions on the other side may well have nothing other than a piece of paper when they are all done.</text>

            <text syncTime="4211.008" offset="16985630">It is in that way this industry is very similar to the garment industry, which was the only other one which received any exemption from Section 8(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.078" offset="17045921">It is the same variety of business arrangements which make it very difficult to maintain the situation of the already organized people who are a group of people basically in competition with other people working... looking for the same work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.258" offset="17118646">The top-down organizing situation which is described is quite likely to be a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.443" offset="17159397">What you really have are ten people and five jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.472" offset="17175488">Five of them are organized, and five of them are unorganized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.846" offset="17188967">And the question is, by getting an agreement with somebody, can you hold onto those five jobs or are you going to find out that all you have is the promise of those jobs, but as soon as the construction starts you find out that somebody else is the employer, and those five unorganized people are doing the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.618" offset="17276112">Now, Congress could say that you cannot use this tool to maintain your situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.302" offset="17310802">Our point of... our point in this argument is that Congress did not say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.689" offset="17340373">The language does not say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.923" offset="17349255">The explanations do not say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.453" offset="17359390">And the explanations in this instance are authoritative and specific, as I started to say in responding to Justice White's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.715" offset="17404425">Congress focused on the contracting and subcontracting on the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.900" offset="17429189">It did so in a way which preserves the right to enter into subcontracting agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.661" offset="17464298">It did so against a background, to take up a point again that Mr. Come made, where one bargaining structure that was prevalent, and as the London Study showed, probably the most prevalent type of structure, was to require that subcontractors assume agreements when they take a subcontract, and no one has ever found the kind of contract that the Petitioners say is the only kind that is legal, an agreement confined to a particular job site where there are both union and non-union people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.357" offset="17687070">Never in the history of collective bargaining... they have all sorts of resources, and they have been busy looking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.387" offset="17707132">Nobody ever signed that kind of agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.590" offset="17716014">It would be impossible, and I think we are in a better position to say this than what they are trying to foist on us, it would be impossible in our view to effectively police and enforce such an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.379" offset="17779126">It would do nothing concerning the fact that the people who are covered, the organized pool of workers, might lose the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="4442.976" offset="17913499">We are not here to quarrel in any way with the Connell case that, taking everything into account, agreements which are entered into outside of a collective relationship, where you don't have the interests which I have outlined, were not intended to be covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="4602.693" offset="18552350">So, the way I would conclude is that there are situations in which the language points one way and the explanations, either in terms of stating the nature of the problem or in terms of explaining what the language, the statutory language means, point in opposite directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.837" offset="18664990">Here, while there isn't a great deal of legislative history, on this particular point, it is very, very precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.850" offset="18696964">Congress doesn't have to be long-winded about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.253" offset="18710652">This happened in the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.285" offset="18718802">The Senate insisted on its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.566" offset="18727893">Senator Kennedy explained its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.954" offset="18737402">That is the sole authoritative statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.937" offset="18745343">Nobody said to Senator Kennedy, wait a minute, that isn't what this means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.404" offset="18763210">Nobody disputed what he said, and what he said is that agreements of this type are entirely lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.418" offset="18791318">And that is perfectly consistent--</text>

            <label>Mr. Lewis K. Scott</label>
            <text syncTime="4669.102" offset="18818068">Yes, Your Honor, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.774" offset="18824755">I hope to cover three points very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.647" offset="18844190">First, how frequent were these kind of clauses in 1959?</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.863" offset="18865088">There are just two studies that suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.129" offset="18874179">First, the London Study, which was not made for this purpose and which the general counsel found inconclusive because it does not distinguish between signatory clauses and other kinds of clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.216" offset="18926528">Secondly, the general counsel's own study, which showed that only 12 percent of the clauses in 1959 included signatory clauses of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.914" offset="18969264">I must flatly disagree with the statement of Mr. Gold in response to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.663" offset="18992252">Secondly--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4713.085" stopTime="4723.752">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4713.085" offset="18993924">Well, do you also disagree with what he said that no one has ever found an agreement that on its face is the kind that you suggest would be legal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_k_scott" startTime="4723.752" stopTime="4773.966">
            <label>Mr. Lewis K. Scott</label>
            <text syncTime="4723.752" offset="19036660">--Well, Your Honor, of course, an agreement of this kind was not required until after the Act was passed, so there would have been no reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.280" offset="19070724">This distinction, growing out of the proviso, only came about after the proviso was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.996" offset="19097578">Second, with respect to what was Congress's awareness in 1959, there are only two places in the entire Congressional Record that suggest an awareness of this particular kind of a clause, and on both of those occasions it was explicitly stated that it was intended that such clauses be illegal, and I refer to our brief on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.704" offset="19208442">I believe it is our reply brief, Page 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.233" offset="19218577">Thirdly, with respect to the statements of Senator Kennedy--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4773.966" offset="19237490">Was that before or after the proviso was put into the hopper, the statement that it should be illegal?</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4793.536" stopTime="4796.660">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4793.536" offset="19315753">I mean, making them illegal was part of making all hot cargo clauses and the like illegal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_k_scott" startTime="4796.660" stopTime="4936.400">
            <label>Mr. Lewis K. Scott</label>
            <text syncTime="4796.660" offset="19328291">--That is true, Your Honor, but going to my third point, which I believe takes up the point you are making, and that is, with respect to the statements of Senator Kennedy, upon which they rely, first of all, it has already been noted by the Court that argument proves too much, because the clause in Connell by the same logic would have been unlawful and not within the purpose of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.150" offset="19426198">Secondly, Senator Kennedy's statement that clauses such as this appear to be legal at that time was technically accurate, but it is misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.271" offset="19470711">The only law at that time on this point of any significance was this Court's Sandor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.628" offset="19496102">Now, this Court in Sandor did indicate that a secondary employer could voluntarily not do business with a primary employer, and yet could put that voluntarism on paper, but the reasoning of this Court in Sandor made it very clear that the union could not force that contractor, the primary or the primary employer... pardon me, the secondary employer to boycott the primary employer, nor could it picket the secondary employer in order to enforce that agreement, nor was that agreement even enforceable in court, because, according to the language and the logic of Justice Frankfurter, that secondary employer at the time he made his decision whether to boycott or not boycott the primary employer had to be unfettered from anything contained in an agreement or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.573" offset="19715948">And finally, with respect to Senator Kennedy's own intentions, I submit they are clear, that his intention was not to legalize this kind of clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.428" offset="19763282">He stated that the reason he believed a proviso was necessary to the hot cargo prohibitions was, it seems that a union ought to be able to ask a friendly concern to stop dealing with a company which will not observe fair labor standards, and that is Senator Kennedy's own specific statement as to why this exception was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.168" offset="19862234">That is at Two Legislative History, 1708, on August 20, 1959.</text>
