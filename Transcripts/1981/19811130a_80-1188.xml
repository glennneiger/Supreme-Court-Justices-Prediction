            <label>Mr. Russell C. Grimes, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="308.745" offset="1234965">Definitely two separate points.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.863" offset="1255445">The Seventh Circuit I feel correctly determined that Congress has not expressly barred states from coordinate regulation of tender offers, and even this Court has said in Section 28(a) that the 1934 Act was designed to preserve state authority as opposed to limit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.709" offset="1346769">Similarly, the Court of Appeals in its decision correctly determined that Congress... the Williams Act is not a pervasive scheme of legislation from which the Illinois Act could be implicitly pre empted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="351.136" stopTime="360.725">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="351.136" offset="1404447">Mr. Grimes, I guess if you consider the SEC's new rules on the subject, you would conclude that it was indeed pre empted, would you not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="russell_c_grimes_jr" startTime="360.725" stopTime="627.248">
            <label>Mr. Russell C. Grimes, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="360.725" offset="1442900">Well, the new rules, which of course are not at issue here, create a direct conflict with a portion of the Illinois Act, in that under the SEC rule it has to commence or be withdrawn within five days, whereas the Illinois Act has a 20-day pre commencement.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.103" offset="1504340">But as far as... although, as I still would submit, the new rule does not apply to this case, we do have examples of other very current state amendments to their statutes, such as New York and Maryland, where you would not have that direct conflict in the sense that it would be impossible to comply with both.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.065" offset="1576229">That would be... that specific portion... provision of the Illinois Act does conflict directly with the new SEC rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.421" offset="1609665">The Court of Appeals said that the Illinois Act stands as an obstacle to achieving the full Congressional purposes in enacting the Williams Act, in conflicts under the Hines versus Davidowitz test.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.994" offset="1659925">The Court of Appeals had four main objections that it found with the Illinois Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.632" offset="1682495">It said that the Illinois Act would substitute regulatory control for investor autonomy; that a hearing could be instituted indirectly by incumbent management; and that the Illinois Act provides for delays grossly... potentially grossly in excess of those contemplated under the Williams Act; and finally, the pre commencement, 20-day pre commencement notification period.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.914" offset="1783641">It is the State of Illinois' position that the Illinois Act ensures that an investor will have an adequate opportunity to make an informed decision, and it also ensures that there will be full compliance with the disclosure requirements in the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.023" offset="1844036">This Court has said that the sole purpose of Congress in enacting the Williams Act was to protect the investor confronted with a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.081" offset="1892310">Now, there are expressions of Congressional neutrality in the legislative history of the Williams Act, but I think it is a... I believe it is a mistake to believe that general neutrality as opposed to setting an unalterable balance... I think those are two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.979" offset="1963886">If in fact the Williams Act created a balance that could not be altered, then I think it is the situation now where the SEC has greatly increased the minimum time a tender offer must remain open to 20 business days.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.552" offset="2022191">If it were an absolute balance in the Williams Act, that these terms were fixed, then I don't think the SEC could change them.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.225" offset="2052807">Instead, I think it is more a feeling of general neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.693" offset="2066704">They don't want to prevent tender offers from being made, but as long as the Illinois Act will not have the effect of precluding the making of tender offers, it can exist with the Williams Act by supplementing the protection afforded an investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.853" offset="2127412">With the question... Certainly the Illinois Act is neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.106" offset="2152385">It applies to the activities of the target company as well as those of the offeror.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.392" offset="2169522">Its specific purpose says it is to be interpreted so as to strike a balance that does not favor either management or the target company.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.164" offset="2200555">It has no exemption for a friendly takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.850" offset="2215393">Getting into the Seventh Circuit's problems that there would be the delay under the Act that would conflict with the purpose of Congress, there is no question speed and surprise are to the benefit of an offeror, but that doesn't follow that that is to the benefit of the investor confronted with a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.481" offset="2301910">The investor's right to make an informed decision, I believe this is furthered when you have reasonable delay because that investor then will have an opportunity to see what value the market places on the tender offer that has been made for his shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.158" offset="2360529">To wit, if another company would come in with a competing bid, that would be an indication of what the true value of his shares are.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.229" offset="2392816">There is certainly nothing in the record to show that the periods of delay in the Illinois Act would hinder the making of tender offers, and I think we certainly have seen that in the period of time since the SEC has increased virtually by 400 percent from the seven day minimum period when it is a tender offer for all the shares under the Williams Act to now 20 business days, which would be approximately four weeks, there has certainly been no slackening in the making of tender offers.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.968" offset="2527817">The hearing provisions of the Act which the seventh circuit found again to be delay, and there is... I would have to agree that under the wording of the Act, incumbent management perhaps indirectly could cause a hearing to be held as required by... if it is 10 percent of the shareholders or a majority of the outside directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.030" offset="2604095">Now, the Securities Commissioner is there to protect the interests of the Illinois residents who are shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.071" offset="2644219">He is not going to be a pawn of either the target company or the offeror.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.773" offset="2663027">The Act does contain time limits, although it says that the Secretary would have the power to extend them if necessary like for the protection of Illinois offerees.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.081" offset="2712242">But the point is, if the Secretary conducts a hearing, if he sees... the purpose of the Illinois Act, to ensure that there has been the full disclosure, and at that point the Secretary isn't going to be subject, and I don't think we could assume that the Secretary is going to be a pawn of the target company.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.293" offset="2773159">The hearing at a very early time, much as if... if the target company presently would go into the district court to seek a temporary restraining order or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.148" offset="2808581">I think it is the same thing being achieved by having a hearing at an early stage to see that the Williams Act or the disclosure under the Illinois Act has been made, and in that event it is not going to be an obstacle to the tender offer going ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.317" offset="6861218">After the new SEC regulations took effect in 1980, New York determined not to be in a conflict situation with Rule 14(d)(2), and therefore made extensive amendments to its Act, so that under the New York Act there is no longer a pre offer waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.164" offset="6948571">New York believes that the state has a legitimate interest in regulating tender offers to protect shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.770" offset="6987024">Since New York's Act became effective, there have been 44 filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.908" offset="7007608">Twenty-three filings were made since the 1980 amendments, and of those, 16 have been made so far this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.196" offset="7044702">New York has never ultimately prevented a tender offer from being commenced or consummated through administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.969" offset="7079811">The function of the New York Attorney General is to determine whether or not there has been full disclosure, and once that determination is made, either that there is full disclosure, and the offer is allowed to proceed on its own course, or is not, and an amendment is required, the offer then continues in the same manner as it would under the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.202" offset="7180748">New York has had four public hearings, two before and two after the 1980 amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.151" offset="7784594">However, there are certain aspects of the Seventh Circuit opinion, namely, what it refers to as the potential for delay under the Illinois statute, which must be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.392" offset="7837466">The state tender offer statutes have one thing in common for the most part, all save Delaware's, and that is a period of time during which the neutral state administrator will look at the offer to determine whether or not it complies with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.604" offset="7918341">That is, whether there is full and fair disclosure in the case of New York and Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.007" offset="7939971">Although the Seventh Circuit leaves the possibility of some state statute remaining in effect, it does not define what that might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.879" offset="7971422">For example, we could speculate a state statute which merely parrots the language of the Williams Act, not being a burden on interstate commerce, but in that context there would be no independent regulatory review of the disclosures in the specific tender offers as exist now under the state takeover statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.645" offset="8062537">Therefore, a key element which New York believes must be addressed is whether there is a legitimate interest in the states to have an independent regulatory review of the disclosures at some point either prior to or during the existence of a tender offer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.545" offset="9714103">Illinois would not say whether or not it is a good price, and I believe there was a misreading of that statement by the Seventh Circuit which led to its conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.487" offset="10285871">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, there are two issues on the merits here, the constitutionality of the Illinois Business Takeover Act on commerce clause grounds, and the constitutionality of it on supremacy clause grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.282" offset="10353058">The Court of Appeals held it invalid on both counts, and in that respect aligned itself with substantially every decision by a federal court on the merits of those questions as they have arisen with respect to state laws such as Illinois'.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.578" offset="10422230">We submit that decision should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.481" offset="10449920">The merits of these questions have been rather elaborately briefed to this Court two years ago in the Leroy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.337" offset="10485342">They have been the subject of three very lengthy and thoughtful decisions of Courts of Appeals of the Third, the Fifth, and the Seventh Circuits, and they have been the subject of a mountain of commentary in the legal literature and in the financial and more practical press, if one may put it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.811" offset="10543229">One would certainly be rather temeritous in supposing that one could add any great deal of enlightenment to this question in the half an hour allowed for oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.501" offset="10577920">I do think that there are elements in the facts of this case which will illustrate in a specific way exactly how these laws, this law, Illinois' law does in truth burden interstate commerce and create a good deal of confusion and delay, subject a tender offeror to the prospects of the conflicting commands of different sovereigns, and in general act in a way which, so far as I am aware, no state assertion of legislative jurisdiction in the history of the country has ever purported to act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.501" offset="10881985">It governs situations in which there may be not a soul in Illinois who owns shares of the stock in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.698" offset="11182707">Rivet is an Illinois corporation, its principal executive office is in Illinois, and somewhat under a quarter of its stockholders are Illinois residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.923" offset="11227638">So there is no question that the statutory tests were satisfied on several alternative grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.375" offset="11245401">What distinguishes these statutes, and what I think raises the constitutional question is the insistence that regulation to be effective must be national, indeed, must be international, that there is no such thing as effective local regulation of a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.919" offset="11307572">I don't know whether that is right or wrong, but it is insisted in the briefs amicus filed on behalf of the appeal here that Illinois is justified in regulating worldwide, because unless it regulates worldwide, it can't effectively regulate at all, and that seems to me, one really has to go back to the nineteenth century, I think, to find judicial discussion of the characteristics of subjects appropriate for the national power and subjects appropriate for the state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.753" offset="11418958">There is language, for example, in the decision in Cooley against the Board of Wardens a century and a quarter ago saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.057" offset="11444140">"Whatever subjects of this power are in their nature national or admit only of one uniform system or plan of regulation, may justly be said to be of such a nature as to require exclusive legislation by Congress. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.233" offset="11496908">What Illinois has, on the contrary, proposed to do in this case by enacting this statute, and what every other state, I think, that has done so likewise proposes it has the right to do, is to impose an absolute veto on a tender offer occurring anywhere in the world provided the jurisdictional contacts, and they vary from state to state, and one of the issues that arose in this case was exactly what the Pennsylvania statute meant when it said principal place of business in Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.130" offset="12220500">Certainly if one goes off on the commerce clause issue, the Williams Act never need be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.600" offset="12242338">It seems to me on that issue, to answer your question, the unconstitutionality of the Illinois Act is quite clear, and it has attempted to be defended on the grounds that, well, a tender offer is really like a merger or like a proxy fight, and is therefore subject to rules that can safely be analogized to those that apply to the internal affairs of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.466" offset="12333767">I think there are three or four answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.752" offset="12346932">One of them is that the statute, which contains a legislative statement of purpose, says not a word on that subject, and while that is obviously not necessarily dispositive, it is surely somewhat indicative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.075" offset="12396251">The location of the statute in the consolidated statutes of Illinois is not where you would find it if it were a regulation of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.265" offset="12433032">Along with the Illinois corporation law, it is tacked right onto the Illinois blue sky law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.169" offset="12452676">It applies to corporations as to which Illinois has never... no state has ever, to my knowledge, asserted the right to regulate the internal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.775" offset="12495099">It applies to corporations that are not incorporated under the laws of Illinois as to which Illinois has not heretofore asserted any right to control internal affairs, and lastly, I think it really is not accurate, acceptable to characterize a tender offer which is a purchase of stock as a matter of the internal affairs of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.290" offset="12585064">It may give rise to subsequent relations that do involve the question of internal affairs of a corporation, and there are aspects of conduct associated with the tender offer that presumably are covered by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.181" offset="12632712">For example, the fiduciary obligations of directors faced with a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.085" offset="12656327">What may they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.885" offset="12659461">May they spend corporate money to oppose it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.302" offset="12665208">Is their obligation simply to make sure that the facts are on the table for the stockholders' decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.655" offset="12686524">There is plenty of scope for state law, and it does no disservice to the solid notions of state responsibility in the sphere of economic regulation properly assigned to states to hold that in this case Illinois has gone much too far simply on commerce clause grounds alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.985" offset="12767922">If one turns to the second branch of the argument, which is the issue as to pre emption, I think the facts of this case will cast in some higher light some of the assertions that have been made with respect to the relations between the Illinois law and the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.267" offset="12861022">It is said that Illinois imposes a slight delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.886" offset="12871471">Well, the fact of the matter is that at the time this tender offer was proposed to be made in January, 1979, as a matter of Federal law, it could have been made in seven days, and as a matter of Illinois law it could not possibly have been made in less than eight weeks, the 20-day pre commencement period of uncertainty mandated by the law and the 20 business days that the offer at a minimum had to be kept open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.720" offset="12978782">In addition, there are the hearing provisions which have been referred to, and given the usually combative nature of these transactions, it can safely be assured that where a hearing can be requested it will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.559" offset="13018175">The hearing itself adds a minimum of another additional five weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.546" offset="13038132">The ten days within which the Secretary is to commence the hearing after he has been asked to do so, and that date he is allowed to extend without any stated limit of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.021" offset="13084003">Then there is a 15 business day period after the conclusion of the hearing in which the Secretary is to render a decision, although that period likewise can be extended without any stated limit of time, and then of course there is the time required for the hearing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.579" offset="13134263">If these procedures were strung out with any ingenuity at all, with half the ingenuity that was displayed in the various maneuvers that in truth went on, you would be confronting something 16, 18 weeks, half a year, seven months, and if one contrasts that on the one hand with one week, which was the period under which an offer... within which an offer could be made under the Williams Act, it seems to me one cannot refer to this in terms of slight delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.646" offset="13242514">It is a gross alteration of the whole terms of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.633" offset="13262472">It ceases to be something recognizable to any draftsman of the Williams Act and becomes something... a horse of an absolutely different color, and indeed probably not a horse at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3812.185" offset="15248718">The tender offer which was made by Mite, a Delaware corporation doing business in Connecticut and Indiana, for stock of Rivet, was the subject of a 75-page in typed form disclosure statement filed with the SEC pursuant to the Williams Act, and in all the claims and charges that were subsequently raised in the several litigations that were brought, it was never contended by anybody, by Rivet or by the Secretary of State of Illinois, that there was anything missing or unfairly stated in this disclosure document, or that any further disclosure of any kind would have been of any use to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.441" offset="15385704">The only ground of objection Illinois ever did assert was simply the technical one that an application for registration had not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.445" offset="15413708">On the basis of publicly available information, it appeared that Rivet, since it was an Illinois corporation and had its principal place of business in Chicago, would be subject to the Illinois Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.903" offset="15455608">The Illinois Act had been held unconstitutional not two months before by Judge Collins in the Northern District, and it seemed really a relatively foregone conclusion that if the same case were presented to the Northern District of Illinois on facts that these tender offers are very much like one another, there would be almost no prospect that the result would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.149" offset="15540558">The period of delay occasioned by complying with the Illinois Act and the expense that would undoubtedly be incurred in doing so, 16, 18 weeks or what have you, made it obviously sensible to initiate the litigation that was initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.290" offset="15593117">Unbeknownst to us, circumstances with respect to Rivet gave rise to the possibility in the minds of its counsel that an argument could be made that the Pennsylvania Act applied, on the view that the largest single plant of Chicago Rivet was located in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, employing somewhat more than half of the work force, and producing somewhat more than half of the total production, and if that could be fitted within the Pennsylvania statutory phrase, principal place of business, that in conjunction with what seemed obviously enough to satisfy the substantial assets test, which was the other part of the Pennsylvania definition, a useful second front might be established against the tender offer by making use of the Pennsylvania statute and the various techniques that could flow from that, so that instead of fighting the Illinois battle on its merits, Rivet and the Secretary of State showed up in court on Monday, the 22nd, and said... indeed, they moved to dismiss on the grounds there was no case or controversy because they were only relying on the Pennsylvania statute at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="4008.678" offset="16034691">One point of interest on this conflict is that in the early posture of the case, the Secretary of State, who may not have been a pawn, but certainly appeared to take no action that was inconsistent with the tactical necessities of Rivet's position from time to time, asserted in court that he was unclear whether he was going to enforce the Illinois Act because of the comity provision which would have permitted him in appropriate circumstances to defer to another state administrator if he felt like it, but a day later or so decided that he would not defer to the Pennsylvania Act for reasons which I think show exactly the problem of conflicting state jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="4132.537" offset="16530077">The nearest situation that occurs off... quickly is the case where an issue before this Court concerned truck mud guards, and the state of Illinois had required one kind of mud guard and the state of Arkansas prohibited the use of that mud guard, so you were confronted with a situation in which there was no truck that could run on the highways of both Arkansas and Illinois without violating one law or the other, and this is the case of Bibb against Navajo Freight Lines, and reading the opinion, one draws the seemingly clear conclusion that the Court attributed considerable significance to the kind of obstructive value which that sort of regulation has.</text>

            <text syncTime="4250.031" offset="17000072">If the states, I suppose, all got together and each agreed to have a series of state laws enacted no two of which would apply to the same circumstance, you would at least have the possibility of knowledge of what law was to apply, and you might be able to comply with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.307" offset="17065169">The ALI Federal Securities Code, not enacted, but at one time, I believe, had the support of the Securities and Exchange Commission, would acknowledge the right of a state to regulate tender offers in the circumstance in which more than 50 percent of the stock was owned by local residents and they owned more than... and they constituted more than 50 percent of the shareholders and the corporation was organized under the laws of that state, and furthermore, the corporation noted somewhere so that you could find it as a matter of public record that it was a corporation that met those tests, and therefore was subject to that state's law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4512.050" offset="18048104">Ever since this Court's ruling in Cooley against Board of Wardens, it has been settled law that the commerce clause places limitations on the power of state authorities to regulate commercial activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4565.435" offset="18261682">Rather than regulating locally and imposing only an incidental effect on interstate commerce, the Illinois statute directly governs interstate commerce across the nation in pursuit of its local objective, and this, we submit, is a complete reversal of the state's proper role under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.062" offset="18336183">Nationwide tender offers for the shares of publicly traded companies are quintessentially interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.233" offset="18364918">The Illinois statute dictates the circumstances under which that commerce may proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.220" offset="18384875">It governs offers by bidders to stockholders throughout the country, so long as the target company has certain connections with the state of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.493" offset="18421969">In the present case, this statute would directly regulate the actions of a bidder in Delaware that wished to offer $23 million to stockholders across the entire nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.368" offset="18465437">The Illinois statute requires the bidder to notify the target company of its confidential tender offer plan, and then wait a minimum of four weeks before commencing the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.425" offset="18509636">The bidder must also await the result of a hearing, if a hearing is demanded by the target company's outside directors, and the Act imposes no time limit for completion of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.881" offset="18551432">Throughout this entire period, stockholders and arbitraguer that wish to sell at the tender offer price are forced to wait and to speculate whether state officials ultimately will grant their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.374" offset="18601482">Trading on national securities exchanges also was affected by the announcement of an offer which may never take place, or which may be delayed for an indefinite period of time, and at the end of the entire process, a nationwide offer can be blocked altogether if state officials deem it to be in violation of local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.752" offset="18682984">Under this regime, the commercial freedom of buyers and sellers throughout the country is burdened.</text>

            <text syncTime="4736.480" offset="18945881">The decisions of this Court leave little room to doubt that this is in excess of the requirements of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.400" offset="18973571">As the Court stated in Shafer against Farmers Grain Company, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.954" offset="18991752">"The right to buy in interstate commerce is not a privilege derived from state laws which they may fetter with conditions, but is a common right, the regulation of which is committed to Congress and denied to the states by the commerce clause. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.147" offset="19056536">And ever since Shafer, this Court has adhered to the view that individual states may not interfere with the natural functioning of the interstate market either through prohibition or through burdensome regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.955" offset="19107736">In a case such as this, we submit, which involves an attempt by a state to issue commands to buyers and sellers far beyond its borders, there is no need to engage in a weighing of local benefits against interstate burdens, but even if this kind of a weighing test were appropriate, the Illinois statute would not, we submit, survive constitutional scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.720" offset="19198851">The legislature's stated purpose for this statute is to protect the interests of Illinois security holders through a disclosure, prohibition of fraud, guarantee of withdrawal and pro ration rights, and provision of time to make a decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="4880.255" offset="19520993">Precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.671" offset="19522664">Illinois says that if its connection test is satisfied, that regulations across the country are governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.861" offset="19551399">We submit that Illinois shareholders already are protected in these very same areas covered by the state statute under the Williams Act, under Congress's chosen standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.717" offset="19590792">The Williams Act requires disclosure of material facts, forbids fraud, prescribes withdrawal and pro ration rights for all tendering stockholders, and it effectively requires that the tender offer remain open for between seven and ten days, and the SEC has rulemaking authority to flesh out all of these requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.345" offset="19665293">Since Congress and the SEC have been vigilant in protecting investors, including Illinois investors, the additional protection afforded by this statute is entirely speculative, as the Court of Appeals correctly concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.704" offset="19726733">While counsel has also suggested that Illinois has an interest in regulating control of local companies, this statute does not address any aspect of corporate control that is within the state's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.762" offset="19778978">The provisions at issue in this case do not prescribe fiduciary duty for management or controlling persons, but instead focus on sale transactions between stockholders and outsiders in national securities markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.189" offset="19832686">This is not an aspect of the internal affairs of the domestic target company that traditionally is subject to local regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.861" offset="19863406">In reality, this statute regulates the business of bidders throughout the entire country, not the internal affairs of local target companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.300" offset="19905097">On the other side of the scale, if one were to attempt to apply a weighing test in this case, the Illinois statute severely burdens both buyers and sellers in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.839" offset="19951282">As the Senate report which accompanied the Williams Act stated, pre commencement waiting periods can delay the offer when time is of the essence, and when Congress passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which was intended to dovetail with the Williams Act, it made the point in the House report that cash tender offers depend on speed and surprise to be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.139" offset="20048457">Congress and the courts have recognized, in short, that pre commencement delay is a potent weapon to defeat tender offers and deprive shareholders of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium, and as the facts of this case show, bidders under the state regulatory regime that we are focusing on today must attempt to comply with potentially overlapping state statutes, all of which have extraterritorial coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.623" offset="20158485">The number of states that ultimately will assert jurisdiction will not be known at the outset of the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.610" offset="20182413">This increases confusion, delay, expense, and opportunities for injunctive orders, all of which can severely encumber the planning and the execution of a nationwide tender offer, and if more than one state does ultimately assert jurisdiction, that permits the state with the strictest standards to set the rules for buyers and sellers throughout the entire country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.143" offset="20276558">Illinois has not cited a single local objective that justifies these major burdens on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.047" offset="20304144">In addition to exceeding the bounds of its authority over local commercial affairs, Illinois has enacted a statute which conflicts with the purposes of Congress under the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.854" offset="20355344">In the Williams Act, Congress exercised its plenary power over commerce to protect investors across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.793" offset="20383138">When it enacted this statute, Congress recognized that tender offers often extend a valuable opportunity to stockholders, and that they frequently serve a useful purpose by providing a check on entrenched but inefficient management.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.886" offset="20443533">In order to assure full disclosure to stockholders without discouraging or hindering the making of tender offers, Congress adopted a carefully selected strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.158" offset="20480627">To achieve its goal, Congress struck a balance between the interests of incumbent management and the bidder, and it permitted each side to fairly present its proposals to public investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.883" offset="20527438">An essential aspect of this regulatory balance is the timetable which Congress prescribed for tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.287" offset="20557113">Under Section 14(d) of the statute, a bidder may disclose its plan and begin to solicit shares simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.624" offset="20590446">Congress deliberately rejected the idea that there should be a compulsory delay between announcement and commencement of tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.730" offset="20622838">It concluded that this would frustrate tender offers and disrupt the operation of the national securities markets, results harmful to the best interests of the investing public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.020" offset="20667977">This Illinois statute clashes with Congress's timetable and upsets its carefully prescribed balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.858" offset="20695353">Illinois requires bidders to announce their confidential plans in advance of the offer, and then wait a minimum of four weeks, and indeed, even longer, if state officials so decree, and while the bidder waits, with its hands tied by state statute, unable to make a solicitation or to present its views about the offer, incumbent management may engage in defensive maneuvers to defeat the offer, including the making of a competing tender offer free of any registration or waiting obligations under Illinois law, and that is precisely what occurred in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.681" offset="20834638">Although economic arguments can be fashioned to show that delay sometimes has beneficial side effects, those arguments are quite beside the point in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.239" offset="20876852">In order to protect investors in the manner that it thought best, Congress adopted a schedule for tender offers and it prescribed a balance for tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.111" offset="20920424">It is not the province of the states to dislodge that balance or to impose a schedule which conflicts with the schedule mandated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.736" offset="20962847">For these reasons and the reasons that we have stated in our brief amicus curiae, we request that the decision of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.905" offset="20995553">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Russell C. Grimes, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5253.959" offset="21015824">A couple of remarks, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.994" offset="21027944">Mr. Shapiro said on a couple of occasions that Congress struck a balance, that the Williams Act already protects shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.815" offset="21055216">Again we are going back to this absolute balance, and we come back to the fact that the SEC even has seen fit to quadruple this balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.469" offset="21085832">I would point out that under the Williams Act we are focusing on the investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.003" offset="21103909">I think that the fact Congress at times has amended the Williams Act, has not seen fit to change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.823" offset="21131285">The Illinois Act covers the activities of the target company on a solicitation for or against.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.727" offset="21158870">A tender offer must be submitted to the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.279" offset="21173081">It is clear that the Illinois Act has incidental extraterritorial effect, but in order to protect the Illinois residents who are shareholders, that all shareholders will receive the same protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.337" offset="21221251">Now, in this case here there is not a situation where there were two states who were invoking their tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.260" offset="21248940">The Pennsylvania Securities Commission declined to take jurisdiction with the Pennsylvania Act over this offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.096" offset="21280287">The Secretary of State, as well as having the comity provision, any burden on interstate commerce, they can accept the federal filing of the 14(d) as compliance with the state Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.804" offset="21327203">And certainly here we have a situation with Chicago Rivet, an Illinois corporation, its principal executive offices in Illinois, 27 percent of the shareholders, 43 percent of the outstanding shares held by Illinois residents.</text>

            <text syncTime="5347.516" offset="21390002">I understood Mr. Shapiro to say that there were no regulations imposed on a counter offer proposed by the target company.</text>

            <text syncTime="5358.221" offset="21432842">The way this came up, the Illinois Act initially as it defines a tender offer does not cover when an issuer is purchasing its own shares, but I am arguing that the Illinois Act covers all solicitations, and I cited that in the reply brief, requires that any solicitation of the target company management either favoring or for the rejection of a tender offer must be filed with the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.205" offset="21548722">So, with the Chicago Rivet's counteroffer here where they recommend... if they are recommending that Mite's not be accepted, that was required to be filed with the Secretary of State under the Illinois Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.881" offset="21599504">It applies to solicitation material by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.333" offset="21617267">My point with Chicago Rivet, that certainly as an Illinois corporation the tender offer is for takeover of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.939" offset="21651749">It is like a merger, a proxy solicitation.</text>
