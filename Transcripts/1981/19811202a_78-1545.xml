            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="126424">We will hear arguments first this morning in Zipes against Trans World Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.689" offset="169160">Mr. Jolley, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Jolley</label>
            <text syncTime="17.593" offset="196746">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the decision of the Seventh Circuit at issue in 80-951 affirms a district court order approving a settlement agreement between defendant, TWA, and plaintiffs who were former TWA employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.708" offset="285248">Pursuant to that settlement, plaintiffs were granted full union or competitive seniority, despite the fact that the Seventh Circuit had previously decided that plaintiffs had failed to establish a violation of Title 7, despite the fact that TWA objected... excuse me, despite the fact that IFFA, the incumbent union, objected to that settlement, and despite the fact that the settlement overrides the seniority provisions of IFFA's collective bargaining agreement with TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.262" offset="411472">From at least the effective date of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and up until October of 1970, TWA maintained a policy of terminating all flight attendants who became mothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.622" offset="472912">On May 30th, 1970, the first charge was filed with the EEOC challenging this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.276" offset="503528">In August of 1970, this litigation was brought against TWA as a class action purportedly on behalf of all flight attendants terminated under that policy since July 2, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.619" offset="560893">In 1976, the district court granted partial summary judgment against TWA, holding that its policy was indeed a violation of Title 7, and also that all claims were timely because TWA had engaged in a continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.099" offset="634767">In 1978, however, the Seventh Circuit vacated that order in a decision known as the consolidated opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.337" offset="667681">The Seventh Circuit held that TWA's policy was indeed unlawful, but that there was no continuing violation, and that the claims of 92 percent of the plaintiff class were therefore untimely pursuant to former Section 706(d), the 90-day time filing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.500" offset="744377">Plaintiffs contended before the Seventh Circuit at that time that TWA had nevertheless waived any timeliness defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.022" offset="782411">The Seventh Circuit in its opinion expressed doubt as to any waiver by TWA, but ruled that the time filing limit is a jurisdictional prerequisite which in any event is not subject to waiver by TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.949" offset="842179">Plaintiffs and TWA thereupon filed petitions for certiorari in Cases Number 78-1545 and 78-1549.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.689" offset="885124">It is important to note that plaintiffs in seeking... in filing their petition for certiorari did not seek review of the Seventh Circuit holding that there was no continuing violation, and it should be remembered that this was the basis for the district court's order granting summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.968" offset="958267">In June, 1979, while those petitions for certiorari were pending, TWA and the plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="217.740" offset="997346">Counsel, what do you think the Seventh Circuit's definition of a "continuing violation" is?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_a_jolley" startTime="226.179" stopTime="458.846">
            <label>Mr. William A. Jolley</label>
            <text syncTime="226.179" offset="1031097">Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit in its opinion considered this Court's decision in Evans, and relying in part upon the decision in Evans concluded that where there is a termination of employment, a permanent severing of the employment relationship, it is that act that starts the statute running, as opposed to a layoff situation where employees maintain a continued link to their job or to their employment, and TWA's refusal in the succeeding years after the terminations beginning in 1965 to rehire is not in the Seventh Circuit's opinion a continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.672" offset="1201102">The violation was the act of termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.874" offset="1209879">The settlement agreement entered into by TWA and the plaintiffs in this case divided the plaintiffs into two subclasses, Subclass A consisting of the 8 percent, approximately 30 in number, who according to the Seventh Circuit had valid timely claims; Subclass B consisting exclusively of the 92 percent, exceeding 400 plaintiffs in number, whose claims are time barred according to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.696" offset="1345193">Under the agreement, TWA agrees to pay each subclass $1.5 million to be apportioned among the respective subclasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.635" offset="1380928">The settlement also contains a non-admission clause regarding TWA's liability and a provision stating that the settlement supersedes past, present, and future collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.545" offset="1436517">Most importantly, the settlement provided that all class members would be offered re-employment and may obtain full competitive seniority to be awarded by the district court</text>
            <text syncTime="342.138" offset="1494927">"in its discretion pursuant to the provisions of Section 706(g) and all other applicable provisions of law without contest or objection by TWA. "</text>
            <text syncTime="354.462" offset="1544246">IFFA, the incumbent union, intervened, and its objections to the district court's jurisdiction, to the approval of the settlement agreement, and to an award granting seniority were all overruled by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.788" offset="1601506">On appeal, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the seniority grant on the basis of this Court's decision in Franks versus Bowman, and rejected IFFA's jurisdictional challenge on the rationale that the policy favoring voluntary settlements outweighs its lack of jurisdiction, even though the Seventh Circuit left undisturbed its previous holding that the time limit is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.487" offset="1696279">IFFA stands before the Court today because valuable contract rights, indeed, its most cherished and important contract rights, previously bargained away to IFFA by TWA through the collective bargaining process, and therefore belonging to IFFA, have been taken from IFFA and given to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.721" offset="1801291">Under the Railway Labor Act, not only is IFFA entitled to determine for itself the collective bargaining process, what changes to make in the collective bargaining agreement, what provisions to try to include or to include in a collective bargaining agreement, it is also entitled to compliance by TWA with its Railway Labor Act obligation to deal exclusively with IFFA, and with no other, not only in setting but in changing the terms and conditions of employment, which includes seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.906" offset="1925947">This Court has previously acknowledged the overriding importance in today's economic system of seniority systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.521" offset="2016435">We want to address primarily the grant of seniority, because we believe there is absolutely no foundation for a grant of seniority in the circumstances of this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Jolley</label>
            <text syncTime="547.235" offset="2315276">As this Court has previously indicated, competitive seniority rights determine the allocation between competing employees to scarce employment benefits, and indeed determine who gets and who keeps an available job.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.577" offset="2380687">In our brief, I think we have detailed that these remarks are even more appropriate to flight attendants by the nature of their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.183" offset="2415064">The nature of the rights that have been taken from IFFA in this case are highlighted by the fact that since 1979, when IFFA intervened in the settlement of this action, hundreds of flight attendants have been furloughed, have not been recalled, and since the collective bargaining agreement would be superseded by the settlement agreement between plaintiffs and TWA, their contractual right to recall within a period of three years, which is a part of the current collective bargaining seniority system, will be deprived by the grant of greater seniority to the plaintiffs in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.256" offset="2667407">Your Honor, the union has chosen, as is its right to do, in a sense to agree by not objecting because plaintiffs in Subclass A have come close to carrying their burden required by Franks in order to demonstrate even the possibility of an entitlement to rightful place.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.205" offset="2759149">IFFA has made a judgment, as in fact courts have done, that those who file timely claims are in a different position than those who have not, and even though the question of TWA's violation as to Subclass A is pending before this Court, the jurisdictional infirmity does not exist as to Subclass A, and for that reason we have chosen, as is our right, to not base our objections on the competitive seniority grant to Subclass A members.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.151" offset="2954963">Moreover, the provision of the agreement which states that flight attendants who are terminated or who resign forfeit all their seniority, that is an integral part of the seniority system, because it is that provision which allows incumbent employees once they have a job to move up and become more entitled to the scarce employment benefits, and that provision has been superseded, and that is integral to the functioning of the entire seniority system.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.961" offset="3238235">That would require us to be a legal successor, which we denied, and again, that has not been litigated, and the actions of the early union in 1971, they entered into a settlement agreement which in fact was based upon the jurisdictional infirmities of 92 percent of the plaintiff class.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.484" offset="4888337">There was and has been no absence of union participation in this litigation in the eleven-year history of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.054" offset="4922610">As Justice O'Connor pointed out, this case was begun by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.057" offset="4938597">There was a complaint filed by the union after the union brought a charge before the EEOC in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.445" offset="4968168">There came a time, three years after the litigation was under way, that the court of appeals decided that the union could no longer represent the class that I now represent because of a conflict of interest, but the union was not ousted from the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.407" offset="5032011">The original union remained in this case until 1976 as a party, participated in the pleadings, filed motions in opposition to summary judgment, and so on and so fort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.013" offset="5074434">In 1976, the district court entered an order that the original union had become defunct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.868" offset="5109856">That was Local 550 of the Transport Workers Union, AF of L-CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.486" offset="5128351">The Court, however, allowed without prejudice the new union, Local 551, to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.426" offset="5164086">That order was entered in April of 1976, and a few days later Local 551 intervened, and so, again, from 1976 on, the union was participating in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.734" offset="5213301">In April of 1977, this union came into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.888" offset="5233885">They did not, however, file to intervene into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.291" offset="5255515">And they did not come into the case until July of 1979, before the settlement agreement was approved by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.480" offset="5296266">One might speculate about why during an eleven-year history of this case there were two years when this union was in existence when a union was not a party to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.955" offset="5342241">But there is no need to speculate, because the union explained why it stayed out of the case to the district judge, and we think that explanation contradicts a good many of the things not only that Mr. Jolley has just said to this Court, but also that the union has said in its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.315" offset="5403681">There is a document entitled Supplemental Suggestions of Intervenor IFFA in Support of Motion to Intervene, and I have lodged copies of this document with the Clerk of the Court, and they are available, and I would like to just read to the Court what the union told the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.394" offset="5491975">"In this case the union certainly had no reason to intervene prior to this time. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.846" offset="5509738">"The union was not in existence for the first seven years of this litigation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.000" offset="5526352">"Shortly after the union came into existence, counsel for the union spoke with counsel for the defendant regarding this litigation, and it was mutually agreed that no purpose would be served by the union intervening at that time, but that intervention by the union might be appropriate if and when the case ever reached the remedy stage.

            <text syncTime="1372.913" offset="5617990">So, the union came into this case purposely only at the time of the remedy, and the union's intervention petition was aimed at two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.054" offset="5658636">One, that the district court should not exercise jurisdiction because the court of appeals had ruled otherwise, and Number Two, that the seniority award would have an adverse impact, an unusual adverse impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.945" offset="5714120">Mr. Jolley in his argument throughout the brief has referred to the settlement agreement depriving his clients of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.135" offset="5746930">The settlement agreement did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.169" offset="5755080">There was a separate seniority award entered by the district judge, not simply after the union made objections, but after a three-month hearing on the matter in which depositions were taken, exhibits were introduced, cross examination was engaged in, and arguments were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.481" offset="5828328">After that litigation was over, with TWA standing aside, is the point at which the seniority award was made by the district court, pursuant to Section 706(g) of the Act, which provides that if a violation is found the district court has jurisdiction to enter a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.628" offset="5904919">Mr. Jolley said there was no finding of violation with respect to Subclass B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.246" offset="5927384">To borrow from the Solicitor General's brief, I think that argument is syntactically complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.435" offset="5952148">What he means by that is not that the district court never found that Subclass B people were not victims of a Title 7 violation, because the district court did so find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.077" offset="5998646">He cannot mean that the district court found no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.362" offset="6015782">The district court did so find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.845" offset="6021738">What he means is that because the court of appeals reversed the district court, therefore we can ignore the fact that there was a violation found, and to make it plain, and now I would like to address the jurisdictional argument, but in doing so, I want to--</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.680" offset="6233121">So when the district court had the case before it in 1979, while petitions were pending here, the case was the same as if the court of appeals had not ruled, and we made the point in our brief that what petitioners are really arguing is that the district judge should have been persuaded by the court of appeals' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.660" offset="6317026">A mandate compels compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.612" offset="6328834">It does not compel agreement, and the court of appeals mandate had been stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.616" offset="6352866">The district court... if the district court was not persuaded by it, and the district court was not, the district court was free, in fact, even without the settlement agreement in this case, the posture of the case in the district court was that the only question remaining was remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.894" offset="6413993">There was a summary judgment for all members of the class.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.843" offset="6625794">The question that I am about to address is, we think, the heart of the union's argument in this case, which is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.884" offset="6669888">Although the union talks about lack of violation, they mean jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.169" offset="6683054">Although they talk about lack of jurisdiction, what they really mean is whether the court of appeals was correct, and I would like to quote Mr. Jolley's statement to the court of appeals... or to the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.522" offset="6812413">"to be heard on the basis of seniority alone, and to try to show the Court there would be a serious adverse impact which would be within the Court's discretion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.008" offset="6842401">Now, the Court, of course, has granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.960" offset="6854208">The question about whether the particular remedy in this case is appropriate is not an issue in the case, because the Court denied certiorari with respect to the union's last question presented in its petition which dealt with that, and the question that remains, we submit, is the question that we have addressed in our brief and that the Solicitor General has addressed in its brief with respect to jurisdiction, and that question arises because, as Mr. Jolley correctly states, with respect to some, and what the percentage is, I believe, is probably about 90 percent of the plaintiffs in this case, their complaint was not filed within... their charge with the EEOC was not filed within 90 days of the time that they were terminated for becoming mothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.454" offset="7016168">The complaint in this case was filed, as I said, by the union, and after the union filed the complaint, TWA answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.060" offset="7054620">The answer is contained in the joint appendix, at Page 8A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.630" offset="7072906">TWA's answer admitted jurisdiction, raised two affirmative defenses, neither of which were statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.570" offset="7108641">Two years later, and this is contained in the joint appendix at Page 54A, the district court entered an order at TWA's behest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.377" offset="7155871">That order, which is contained in the appendix on 54A, found that the court had jurisdiction over all members of the plaintiff class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.601" offset="7200801">That order was pursuant to a settlement that TWA had worked out with the prior union, which was ultimately set aside, as I mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.124" offset="7238835">The case wound its way on, and four years after the filing of the complaint, TWA made a motion to amend their answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.663" offset="7281049">They claim now that the plaintiff's complaint can be defended on the basis that there was... that they failed to comply with the "statute of limitations".</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.489" offset="7336324">The district court granted TWA leave to amend, but cautioned that TWA was going to be required to show that its delay and failure to raise this defense for four years was excusable, and that the plaintiff suffered no prejudice as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.736" offset="7421275">Five years after the lawsuit began, TWA appeared in district court in 1975, and for the first time in this case raised the question whether this was jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.280" offset="7487521">Former Section 706(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.330" offset="7495671">TWA argued that the failure to comply with the charge filing provisions of Title 7 was a jurisdictional defect, and since it is jurisdictional, TWA wanted to take advantage of the ancient maxim that any party at any time in the litigation can raise a jurisdictional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.230" offset="7583338">The district court asked how in the world a motion like this can be filed five years after the lawsuit began, but I guess I have no choice, because you are raising a jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.252" offset="7627328">It was at that point that the district court rejected TWA's argument about jurisdiction, found a continuing violation, entered summary judgment for Subclass B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.123" offset="7670901">Those two findings, summary judgment and continuing violation, were the subject of 1292(b) interlocutory appeals to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals ruled in 1978 that in fact the time limits were jurisdictional, and we petitioned for certiorari, and the court has granted our petition.</text>

Franks has been mentioned, Albermarle Paper Company versus Moody, and a number of other cases... that the remedial provisions of Title 7 were modeled after the National Labor Relations Act, and the close provision in the National Labor Relations Act, former Section 706(d) of Title 7, that we are dealing with now, has language similar to what we are talking about here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.184" offset="13999116">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, four points remain to be countered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.006" offset="14026388">Plaintiffs particularly argue that there has been a finding of a violation on the basis of the district court's summary judgment order in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.196" offset="14067139">The first thing I want to point out is that the district court order approving the settlement agreement, the district court order granting the seniority, and the Seventh Circuit opinion affirming that exercise by the district court did not in any way refer to the finding of a violation on the part of TWA or the commission of an unlawful employment practice by TWA as a basis for approving what TWA and the plaintiffs did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.096" offset="14174764">It was based instead entirely on and laced throughout referenced to the settlement agreement between TWA and the plaintiffs, and the policy encouraging voluntary settlements even in the lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.237" offset="14223351">Secondly, the plaintiff maintains that there really was a violation found as to Subclass B because the act... because the practice by TWA was found to be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.379" offset="14275910">That is not so, and moreover it cannot be so by virtue of this Court's decision in Evans, where you very clearly held that the timely filing of a charge is a part of the violation, and that a discriminatory act not made the basis of a timely charge must be treated as lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.423" offset="14348112">In that case, the no marriage rule of the airline was unlawful, but it had to be treated as lawful because it was not subjected to a timely filing of a charge.</text>
