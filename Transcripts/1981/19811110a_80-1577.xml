            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133886">We will hear arguments next in City of Mesquite against Aladdin's Castle, Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.310" offset="171084">Mr. Archer, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elland Archer</label>
            <text syncTime="39.203" offset="290621">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="42.640" offset="304413">The primary question in this case is whether or not the playing of coin-operated machines is a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.778" offset="336910">There are other questions, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.823" offset="349135">The second important question is which rules of law are applicable to adults and which are applicable to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.194" offset="378601">With your permission, I'd like to discuss the fundamental right question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.441" offset="415590">We think in finding a fundamental right on a par with freedom of speech and religion, right to travel and other important rights that the Court of Appeals used an extremely broad interpretation of the term "association".</text>
            <text syncTime="89.589" offset="492182">Of course, in its broadest terms "association" would encompass all commercial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.650" offset="520394">We realize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.619" offset="524260">If you rent an automobile, of course, there may be some associational aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.818" offset="549128">If you rent a boat, if you rent a motel room, you may have guests in.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="107.534" offset="563966">Well, if you associate together to fix prices, I suppose that's freedom of association.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elland_archer" startTime="114.516" stopTime="306.235">
            <label>Mr. Elland Archer</label>
            <text syncTime="114.516" offset="591865">Yes, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.751" offset="592805">What we're saying is that you can't just take the term "association" in its ordinary sense and apply it as the association that is protected by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.761" offset="648916">We feel that there is something more than just mere physical proximity to constitute association protected by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.945" offset="685592">For instance, if you go in a bank to make a loan you're going to talk with people, you're going to meet friends and acquaintances.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.831" offset="717148">When you go in the supermarket, when you're at work, you have association with your fellow workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.032" offset="745987">But these are all matters governed by the law of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.375" offset="759362">I'd like to discuss for just a moment the nature of the transaction that is regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.027" offset="789977">What we have here is a simple rental agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.510" offset="803875">Generally a customer pays 25 cents for use of a machine, generally from one to three minutes or whatever time it takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.833" offset="853194">No different from renting a lawn mower or renting a power saw or any other machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.331" offset="879107">Now, if this type of transaction is the association that is protected by the Constitution under the decisions of this Court, then every commercial transaction known to man becomes a First Amendment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.387" offset="951414">This we feel will weaken the values that have traditionally been upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.382" offset="983388">Going to the question of which rules of law are applicable to adults and which are applicable to children, we say children are simply not the same as adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.111" offset="1046291">We don't mean to imply that children have no constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.453" offset="1067607">Certainly they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.639" offset="1072413">But the rights of children are not always the same as the rights of adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.918" offset="1097491">I think in the words of Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion in May versus Anderson, he said it much better than I can:</text>
            <text syncTime="252.538" offset="1143989">"Children have a very special place in life which law should reflect. "</text>
            <text syncTime="257.380" offset="1163319">"Legal theories and their phrasing in other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncritically transferred to a determination of a state's duty towards children. "</text>
            <text syncTime="269.454" offset="1211698">As we read the opinion of the Court of Appeals, we feel that the Court of Appeals has relied upon cases that are good cases, but they are cases dealing with something other than children.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.790" offset="1277004">They deal with race, they deal with adults, they deal in suspect areas, they deal with the right to decide whether or not to bear a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.504" offset="1319845">But they don't deal with the facts at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.565" offset="1336146">Therefore we feel that these cases are inapplicable.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="321.979" offset="1421723">I don't know that we have evidence to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.572" offset="1432172">We think that playing them, playing the machines in the actual setting in which it takes place in many cases is harmful, not in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.332" offset="1479192">We don't claim that in every case there is harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.472" offset="1495702">But we also say that we cannot tailor a law that will fit every establishment in town.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.521" offset="2731920">There is no state rule of law to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.489" offset="2743832">The Court of Appeals, even in their discussion of the "rational basis", first found that there was a fundamental right, that of association, and then reasoned backwards by placing the burden of proof on the City, saying the City failed to produce evidence to show this and that.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.006" offset="2881863">But I think the judgment is incorrect because of a body of federal law that the Court of Appeals misapplied, not any state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.423" offset="2923555">There's no state law, strict scrutiny test versus rational basis test doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.874" offset="2953334">Looking at the application of law to children, as I say, I think the Court of Appeals improperly applied rules of law pertaining to adults or to race and other matters, instead of confining it to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.659" offset="3060436">Obviously, children do not have all the rights that adults have.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.029" offset="3101919">Children do not choose their domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.607" offset="3112263">They do not choose the school they wish to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.700" offset="3128668">They do not in all cases choose the church that they wish to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.870" offset="3145282">And while this may be considered private action, it is buttressed at every point by state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.882" offset="3177360">For instance, if a child refuses to reside in the domicile chosen by his parents, he's treated by the state as a runaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.331" offset="3207140">If he refuses to attend the school that his parents choose, he's treated as a truant.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.564" offset="3232113">If he refuses to do the other things that his parents require him to do, the state makes an exception and allows physical punishment that wouldn't be permissible for an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.435" offset="3275581">Of course, many states require a parent's signature for the issuance of a driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.213" offset="3302644">Others require a parent's signature for a minor to marry.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.914" offset="3325527">Of course, there are countless other things in which the state buttresses the action of the parent in not allowing the same rights to minors as adults.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.169" offset="12762523">We also have argued in our brief that the right of association is implicated, and the court... the case came here on the question stated in the jurisdictional statement of whether there exists a right of social association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.130" offset="12850399">That was the principal issue stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.035" offset="12858026">I submit that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.424" offset="12871506">This Court has... although it hasn't ruled on that point expressly, I submit that there ought to be such a right, just as there is... just as entertainment enjoys First Amendment protection as expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.059" offset="12934095">And in the case at bar, at least the stated purpose of the ordinance is to prohibit young people from congregating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.478" offset="12963770">The preamble says in fact that congregation of youthful patrons creates problems of policing due to the need to protect the patrons from the influence of those who promote gambling, sales of narcotics, and other unlawful activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.972" offset="13021762">So the purpose of this, although as Justice Stevens points out it's directed to individual games as well as places where there are more than one game, the purpose, the stated purpose, is to prevent congregating, which is an exercise of the right of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.746" offset="13084769">The method chosen is to prevent them from playing the games when they get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.292" offset="13098980">So it's perhaps an ineffectual method of preventing them congregating, but that is its purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.676" offset="13164495">The scope of the particular right may be reduced in the case of a minor by one or more of the factors identified by Justice Powell in Bellotti II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.923" offset="13205559">These factors are taken into account in defining the state interest to justify the regulation limiting a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.544" offset="13240041">But nevertheless, even though minors are involved, the fundamental right should enjoy the strict scrutiny... the protection of the strict scrutiny test, having in mind that the state may have a stronger interest or a different interest in regulating the conduct of children than adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.880" offset="13313393">But nevertheless, the strict scrutiny test should apply and the restriction should bear some... should serve some substantial purpose in regulating the evil to which it's directed, and it should be reasonably limited... the means should be limited to that which is necessary to protect the interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.905" offset="13537419">But that doesn't mean that their congregating is not a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.168" offset="13554555">It just means that that fundamental right has to be balanced against the compelling interest of the state, and in that instance I believe the state... the compelling interest prevails.</text>

            <text syncTime="3672.727" offset="14824733">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.475" offset="14839780">I don't agree with counsel's idea of how the case may be treated as the only alternatives either to dismiss the appeal and then deny certiorari or grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.890" offset="14909370">I think this Court could remand the case back to the District Court or to the Court of Appeals for clarification as to whether they are making a decision based upon an independent state ground or whether they consider the provisions identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.694" offset="14996619">I think that it would be a terrible thing if the case does go off on that point, because even though you're reviewing a judgment and not an opinion, that opinion of the Court of Appeals is in the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.514" offset="15071852">And that means that the cities throughout the Fifth Circuit that desire to have this type of ordinance, whether there's any diversity jurisdiction between their operators in the city or not, are going to be harmed by this opinion on the books, assuming of course that you disagree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.521" offset="15159937">Of course, if you agree with the opinion I assume that that would become the law of the land and it wouldn't make any difference which circuit you were in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.174" offset="15194523">But assuming that you did disagree with the opinion of the court, but you felt that you must deny certiorari, then as I say I don't think that's the only alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.729" offset="15256799">I think it can be remanded back for clarification as to whether or not this was an independent state ground or whether it was just mere verbiage to the effect that, yes, the state constitution is similar to the federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.174" offset="15342480">I think the overriding question was federal law, and I think that's how the Court of Appeals decided the case, based on the level of review to be accorded this type of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.933" offset="15401517">In other words, whether it should be a rational basis--</text>

            <text syncTime="3819.713" offset="15412697">Let me ask you, under your view if this problem of state-federal law had been threshed out more fully in the Court of Appeals during argument, which... should it have based the decision on state law or federal law, if it had to choose between the two?</text>

            <text syncTime="3860.884" offset="15577373">But I don't think it was their intent to determine that there was separate state and federal law.</text>
