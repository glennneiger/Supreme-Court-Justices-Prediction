            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="137789">We will hear arguments first this morning in number 1464, James G. Watt, Secretary of the Interior against the Energy Action Educational Foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.948" offset="193482">Mr. Claiborne, you may proceed when you're ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="20.055" offset="217933">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.257" offset="226814">At issue in this case is the federal oil and gas leasing program on the Outer Continental Shelf; that is to say, the zone of the seabed offshore more than three or nine miles of that belt which was conceded to the coastal states in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.155" offset="310406">As the Court knows, beyond that state belt the United States has the exclusive right to exploit the mineral resources of the Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.418" offset="343425">And since the enactment of the Outer Continental Shelfs Act in 1953 it has done this by granting leases to private oil companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.881" offset="393267">Those leases are granted, or sold as the term is, at auction on the basis of sealed bids submitted simultaneously for specified tracts within a defined area of the Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.172" offset="450422">No one knows in advance how many bidders there will be on any particular tract.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.590" offset="484068">In normal course the highest bidder wins that lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.918" offset="485427">Now, traditionally federal oil and gas leases have resulted in three forms of revenue to the federal government quite beside taxes: first, the so-called cash bonus, which is paid at the outset for the privilege of the lease; secondly, an annual rental paid for the primary term; and finally, if there is production, a so-called royalty or percentage of the value, the gross value of the minerals actually extracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.688" offset="608516">Until 1978 the law permitted only two forms of bidding systems for federal lands on the Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.042" offset="657939">The first was bidding on the amount of the initial bonus, the rental and the royalty being fixed in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.336" offset="683121">The second system was bidding on the royalty rate, in this case the amount of the bonus and the annual rental being fixed in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.894" offset="721365">The choice which of these two systems to use was entirely left to the Secretary of the Interior, and for the first 20 years, between 1954 and 1974, leases were invariably granted or offered on the basis of the so-called cash bonus system with a fixed royalty of one-sixth.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.527" offset="807882">That is what we refer to as the traditional bidding system; indeed, as I say, it had lasted invariably for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.023" offset="845812">Beginning in 1974 and for the four ensuing years there were a substantial number of tracts offered under variants of that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.081" offset="890011">The royalty was sometimes fixed at one-third instead of one-sixth; or it was fixed on a sliding scale, varying between one-sixth and one-half depending on the volume and value of oil or gas extracted during a given quarter; or finally, in a few cases, the leases were offered on the basis of royalty bidding with a fixed bonus per acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.209" offset="1002547">But the traditional formula, that is, the cash bonus with the one-sixth royalty, remained the norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.471" offset="1035670">However, in 1978, effective in mid-September of that year, the Congress enacted amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and that is what provoked the present lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.232" offset="1086661">Most relevantly, the Congress provided for new bidding systems not previously authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.979" offset="1121665">The question in this case is whether the Secretary of Energy is required under these amendments to promulgate regulations for each of those new authorized bidding systems, and whether the Secretary of the Interior is required to actually use each of those new bidding systems, notwithstanding that both Secretaries may have determined that one or more of those systems is not in the public interest or does not further the statutory objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.248" offset="1242769">There is also a threshold question.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="310.423" offset="1379441">And also to decrease the concentration of the leasing?</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="313.703" stopTime="386.266">

            <text syncTime="313.703" offset="1392502">There was, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.514" offset="1399817">We suppose that those objectives were intended to further the ultimate objectives of increasing revenues and increasing production consistent with efficient operations, consistent also with environmental concerns which are specified in the law as among the objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.991" offset="1473691">As I say, there is also a threshold question which is whether the particular plaintiffs in this suit, the respondents before this Court, have standing to complain about the action or nonaction of the two Secretaries, those plaintiffs being the California Lands Commission, which has charge of state leasing on the Shelf, the City of Long Beach, which as a matter of California law has certain privileges with respect to the area adjacent to that city; and secondly, a group of consumer groups and others who claim standing because they're affected by the bidding systems insofar as they affect price and supply of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.943" offset="1637531">Now, as cases go this one has proceeded fairly swiftly to this Court, but the procedural history is nevertheless too complex to detail in the time available.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="386.266" offset="1682775">Well, does the Government have any doubt that the Court of Appeals, to get by the standing question the Court of Appeals properly reached the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.513" offset="1727810">Wasn't the only issue there the propriety of issuing that preliminary injunction or not issuing it?</text>

            <text syncTime="406.899" offset="1765322">The Government sides with the Court of Appeal in this respect: the court took the view that since it was reviewing the denial of a preliminary injunction, it plainly had jurisdiction of the case, and that since the issues were pure issues of law, notwithstanding the finding of the District Judge that they were disputed issues of fact, the court could, while entertaining the case on the review of the denial of preliminary injunction, reach the other issues in the case, as it did.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="433.575" offset="1872006">The other issues remain whether the District Court should have issued a summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="451.396" offset="1943373">Indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.084" offset="1946089">Having the case, having, in our view, correctly determined that there were no outstanding issues of fact, considering the statutory injunction to the courts to resolve these controversies without undue delay, the court concluded, it seemed to us fairly, that it ought not remand, direct the entry of one or the other motion and then take an appeal from a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.525" offset="2071791">Now, I couldn't possibly do justice to the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.084" offset="2094047">It is printed in the Appendix and takes some 82 pages, not to mention 45 pages of appendices attached to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.691" offset="2128529">Mr. Justice White has already indicated that the case arises on the second appeal on the denial of cross motions for summary judgment and on the denial of a motion for preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.856" offset="2201149">There had been a previous appeal from the denial of another motion for preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.178" offset="2250468">The suit was originally aimed at a particular lease sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.270" offset="2262798">Efforts were made to abort that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.598" offset="2264156">When the sale nevertheless took place because the District Judge declined to enjoin it, an appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.769" offset="2272829">That first appeal, resulting in an opinion by the late Judge Leventhal, pointed out, among other things, in denying the appeal that Congress had in this instance imposed a degree of legislative oversight that was perhaps sufficient to protect the public interest without a need for the court to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.853" offset="2381185">On this final appeal from which our petition for certiorari is taken, the Court of Appeal first denied the preliminary injunction but then in most respects held in favor of the respondents before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.548" offset="2455895">At least this much can be said for that decision, which is not in all respects unambiguous: it directed the Secretary of Energy on a schedule set out by the court to promulgate regulations for at least two of the optional bidding systems now provided under the amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.832" offset="2589015">Nine new ones and plus a catch-all provision which authorizes the Secretaries to devise further permutations, combinations and indeed brand-new systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.780" offset="2636871">The court also directed the Secretary of the Interior to experiment with at least these two systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.619" offset="2680235">The entire purpose of requiring the Secretary of Energy to promulgate the regulations was that under the statute that is a necessary first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.255" offset="2726733">The basic holding is that the Secretary of the Interior must actually experiment with these two systems which do not involve a bidding on the front-end bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.532" offset="2755885">Now, I will turn directly to the merits of the case, if I may, and draw the Court's attention to the statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.372" offset="2803219">The relevant provisions are set out in the Appendix to our brief beginning at page 101a.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.116" offset="3174158">I quite agree, Justice Brennan, that if either group has standing, one needn't be concerned about the other group.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.036" offset="3197877">One more word about California and the city, the thrust of this case is that the federal bidding system discourages most potential bidders because the front-end bonus allows only the largest companies to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.074" offset="3274050">Logically that should leave a great number of potential bidders who are ready and willing to engage in leasing on the Shelf who therefore could take up state leases if any were offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.116" offset="3330161">None have been offered for more than a decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.818" offset="3337058">Turning to the merits, if I may, and focusing on the provision of Section 1337 as it's shown at the bottom of page 101a, which is in the statute; it's an amendment to Section 8(a)(1)(1) of the Outer Continental Shelfs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.574" offset="3423993">It reads,</text>

            <text syncTime="848.893" offset="3533289">"The bidding shall be by sealed bid and, at the discretion of the Secretary, on the basis of. "</text>
            <text syncTime="858.669" offset="3572369">There follow seven lettered paragraphs describing variant bidding systems; in fact, those seven paragraphs, as we read them, include ten separate bidding systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.022" offset="3629838">And that, ending with paragraph (G) on the following page, is followed by the word "or".</text>
            <text syncTime="877.615" offset="3648228">And then we have subparagraph (H) which is a provision, a catch-all provision allowing the two Secretaries to devise permutations, combinations or new systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.625" offset="3708205">Now, if the matter ended there it would be indeed very strained to argue that "authorized" meant directed, that</text>
            <text syncTime="914.225" offset="3794618">"at the discretion of the Secretary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="914.396" offset="3795350">meant that he had no choice which system to use, and that the connective "or" should be read as "and".</text>
            <text syncTime="918.661" offset="3812382">Unfortunately, we know that resourceful lawyers and resourceful courts sometimes read language not quite so literally as I've suggested, and it is conceivable that if the statute ended there a court might reasonably take the view that if the Secretaries declined to experiment with any of the new systems included in these amendments, that would amount to an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.256" offset="3950726">Even then we would argue that Congress had merely widened the choice available to the Secretaries, had removed the shackles of the original statute, had nudged goaded the Secretaries to experiment, but that at the end of the day they would remain free, if they concluded after investigation that the public interest would not be served, not to use such systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.384" offset="4071307">Congress might have been disappointed, but it would have been free, as it is now, to issue a clearer mandate to the administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.004" offset="4117805">But in fact, the amendments themselves resolved this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.097" offset="4134106">When we look at the critical section on page 104a, which is Section (5)(B), we see that the statute has put a limit on the exercise of the discretion the two Secretaries enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.837" offset="4225116">It has told them that for the next five years at least 20 percent but not more than 60 percent of the acreage offered must be offered under bidding systems other than the traditional one, the traditional one being (A) in this list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.486" offset="4299722">Even then there's an escape hatch which allows the Secretary to conclude that following that requirement is not furthering the statutory policies and objectives, but that is no doubt a matter which requires a heavy justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.509" offset="4379761">In any event, it's a provision which the Secretary has not invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.570" offset="4391987">So in principle the limits on the discretion of the administrators of the program has been defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.692" offset="4428453">It has been defined as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.847" offset="4433156">For at least 40 percent and up to 80 percent of the acreage offered each year the traditional bidding system must be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.657" offset="4468369">And on the other hand, for at least 20 percent and up to 60 percent of the acreage the alternative systems must be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.309" offset="4506925">Now, the natural inference from this specific provision qualifying the Secretary's discretion is that in all other respects they are free to do as they think best.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.443" offset="4563559">Now, it seems to be argued, notwithstanding this, that the provision which I have just adverted to, (5)(B), because it says</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.565" offset="4603996">"The bidding systems authorized shall be used in the following percentages. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.031" offset="4629910">that this means each and every one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.562" offset="4644016">Now, respondents don't seem to have the courage of their convictions, nor did the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.043" offset="4685916">They seem to be ready to excuse the Secretaries from using some of the bidding systems that have been newly authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.976" offset="4713606">That's no doubt because it would be extreme indeed to say that each year the Secretary must resort to ten different systems, each with many variations possible, not to mention devising new systems under paragraph (H).</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.978" offset="5317662">I think the fair statement is that the Secretary of the Interior has concluded that very little can be done by way of changing bidding systems that will have much of an effect on the concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.141" offset="5402298">Concentration may be slightly overstated because there is the possibility and there is a reality of joint ventures where smaller firms can join together; the larger ones may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.140" offset="5414315">But what deters the smaller firms is the enormous costs quite outside of any bonus, and the enormous risks, especially now that we are dealing with frontier areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.824" offset="5605009">And in those circumstances smaller companies are simply... are unlikely to be in a position to actively participate in this offshore leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.791" offset="5612950">The Secretary has taken the view that by enlarging the areas available he may make it more possible for other firms not presently engaged to have their opportunity to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.554" offset="5643983">But this question of whether the Secretaries must test each alternative is in fact resolved by the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.882" offset="5645237">When we look at Section 8(a)(9), which is on the same page, we notice a reporting requirement which requires the Secretary of Energy in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior to report annually to Congress, in the words of the statute,</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.847" offset="5681077">"the reason why a particular bidding system has not been or will not be utilized. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.638" offset="5744293">Congress may look again at their reasons and determine that they're not satisfactory and amend the statute further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.305" offset="5791000">There is a similar provision which appears on the last page of the brief, another report which again requires the Secretary of the Interior this time to explain the reasons why a particular bidding system has not been utilized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.059" offset="5910014">It resolves any ambiguity there may be in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.400" offset="5931330">What it seems to come to is this: that some members of the Congress were probably persuaded or at least half persuaded, perhaps by the respondents who were very active in the legislative process, that net profit share was a promising alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.158" offset="5998413">Others may have been persuaded that work commitment was a promising alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.047" offset="6013877">Others preferred a different formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.186" offset="6022445">Some members may have been in favor of compelling the Secretary to adopt their pet system, though surprisingly there is no one who unambiguously says so during the legislative debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.431" offset="6083467">Many were in favor of widening the options but leaving the Secretaries free to make their own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.661" offset="6128398">Not unusually, these extreme views were either compromised or merged in a wider consensus, a middle position which is reflected in the enacted statute; that is, that some experimentation was indeed mandated, short of a very strong finding by the Secretaries that that would not be in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.665" offset="6240411">But which new alternatives should be tested for those experiments was a matter left to the administrators of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.755" offset="6280744">Now, that's hardly a surprising conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.255" offset="6286805">The advantages and disadvantages of each bidding system are not easily appraised by laymen or by lawyers or by judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.485" offset="6319719">When one reads the joint appendix in this case, it seems more addressed to a specialized tribunal of experts than it does an ordinary court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.919" offset="6361410">Economists on both sides have exhausted themselves in arguing the merits and demerits of each system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.476" offset="6419611">Congress itself was reluctant to resolve that technical debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.817" offset="6436956">Much less, as it seems to us, did Congress invite the courts to resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.316" offset="6446987">Congress has monitored this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.955" offset="6469557">There have been at least three legislative oversight hearings since the program began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.483" offset="6491709">The Secretary has fully advised the Congress of his actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.823" offset="8853074">Now, it's totally frustrated by what's happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.989" offset="8901662">Appendix A to our brief shows that in the last three years the exclusive use of variance of bonus bidding has produced no advance whatever in the competition and revenue objectives of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.346" offset="8931128">I have lodged with the Clerk of this Court the answer to three Congressional questions given by the Secretary three week ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.936" offset="8961430">And in his answers to Jones and Hubbard question 7... those are Congressmen... and Lent and Forsythe question 14, and his answer to Lent and Forsythe question 15, the Secretary three times says the new systems we tried are a failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.945" offset="9033528">They have not promoted competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.692" offset="9060486">So I think a more candid answer that the Solicitor General may have made is that the Secretary now says we have gotten nowhere, which is also clear from Appendix A, over the last three years by using the bonus bidding varieties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.547" offset="9099879">And that's obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.359" offset="9103222">The whole problem that Congress was addressing was these big bonuses prevent an adequate number of bidders, and with so few bids we don't know that we're getting a market in which we're getting a fair return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.793" offset="9148885">When you continue to reject the nonbonus three options that Congress specified and use only the bonus options Congress specified, you have debilitated yourself from the fair experiment which was intended to compare one system against the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.270" offset="9986788">That's the whole point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.911" offset="9989400">So I think to say that an ornery Secretary could do this experimentation, discover, as California has discovered, that profit-sharing gets much better results than the cash bonus system, but then just quixotically say well, in the next 30 years I don't like that system; I'm not going to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.935" offset="10065469">I cannot say that it is impossible that if this experiment were conducted and succeeded a Secretary might still kick it in the garbage can.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.897" offset="10121371">But the premise on which the Government is arguing is essentially a recitation of the whole premise for the experimental program, that we have Secretaries who are intelligent men who will use a successful experiment and then use the best of the systems that yield the best revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.330" offset="10171108">So Congress is assuming that the function of this five-year experimentation is to give the Secretary an informed discretion at the end of the five years to use the best system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.701" offset="10212591">And I think we have to assume a very high likelihood that if he does what Congress mandated and clearly wanted to do here, and the California system proves as effective in use here as it does for California, that in all likelihood he will then use that system then, perhaps not on every sale but on a substantial number of sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.985" offset="13129632">No, but Congress has been also watching this lawsuit and knew as of last fall that the Court of Appeals had ruled that we are right, and I think hopes, as I hope, that this Court will agree with the Court of Appeals that the frustration of the underlying purpose of the statute is so clear here, never mind the specific history which I've read, that the Secretary should be required in the remaining two years... and this is an emergent matter... to make some, some experimental resort to some of the nonbonus systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.348" offset="13235167">That's the only way to carry through the underlying objective of this statute, because the ridiculous situation is that Congress identified the cash bonus as a problem, said you shall experiment with three cash bonus and three non-cash bonus systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.297" offset="13286889">The Secretary in an ornery fashion insists on trying those systems least likely to solve the problem, because they still use the cash bonus, and all of a sudden suggests that the other one is somehow a terrible system that cannot be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.181" offset="13342478">The one rationale he gives for not using the California system which has been so successful in effect is that there may be underproduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.366" offset="13379154">But in Section 8(a)(3) Congress already addressed that very point, and on page 35 of our brief we quote the legislative history where it says to solve the problem of possible underproduction on the very high profit share bids as the lease starts yielding less oil and gas, the Secretary can reduce or remove the profit share completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.466" offset="13467552">So Congress actually already addressed the complaint the Secretary is making about using or testing the California leasing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.352" offset="13507154">We live in a world where there are theories and realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.212" offset="13510602">The reality is that almost the biggest state of this union for 30 years has had successful resort to the profit share system, which is the one Congress most hoped would turn the trick for the federal government, which is the one that the Secretary absolutely refuses to test, and by so doing, in our opinion, if we may submit, it is frustrating not only the great public policy which was achieved at great agony in the Congress after two successive efforts and after 25 years of patience, after 25 years Congress said all this discretion has to end; we're going to test for five years in a meaningful way to compare this system with that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.494" offset="13655738">Well, the Secretary is comparing apples with apples, whereas Congress said compare the apples with the oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.615" offset="13700147">And it's not surprising but it's sad, and both because of the public interest and the consumer interest and California's direct financial stake in this controversy, we suggest, Your Honors, that the Court's decision be that the law should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.391" offset="13747271">And unless the Court has any further questions of me, I think I will probably rest on Judge Learned Hand and hope that this Court will give a reading to this statute which gives vitality to what Congress wanted and made clear, rather than one which defeats the obvious intent of the Congress to give a new lice on leafing... a new life to leasing... that pays me back for trying puns at the end of an argument... but it was to be new life to leasing that was to be given, and it is being killed by the Secretary's absolute refusal to test the nonbonus bidding system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.913" offset="13981433">It's a document which represents the responses of Secretary Watt to questions asked at the most recent oversight hearings in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.829" offset="14049038">That response is dated September 14 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.579" offset="14052068">And particularly on page 38 and on page 39 of that document there are two answers to questions by Congressman Lowry specifically addressed to the deterrent effect of the cash bonus as compared to the deterrent effect of the development cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.260" offset="14110791">The Secretary there recites that the development cost can exceed one billion dollars; no bonus has ever reached anywhere near that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.960" offset="14149557">Turning to the question that was focused on by Justice White, if our opponents concede that the statute does not require testing each and every one of the various alternatives... and there are at least ten of them... then there is no basis in the statute to prefer one over another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.512" offset="14255823">Congress treated these alternative bonus systems as true alternatives, and it's no good saying that Congress really meant that net profit was the only true alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.755" offset="14328757">Congress simply did not view it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.817" offset="14333041">One last thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.019" offset="14337848">The talk of experimenting is a little lighthearted when one appreciates that it isn't an experiment which is subject to repeal.</text>
