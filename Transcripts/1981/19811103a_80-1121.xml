            <text syncTime="59.555" offset="361537">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.394" offset="396959">It involves two different pay systems for federal employees, the prevailing rate system, or WS system, which essentially covers blue collar workers, and the General Schedule or GS system which covers white collar workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.487" offset="457250">Each pay system contains different grade levels and different steps within each grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.924" offset="483059">The steps are different gradations of pay within the grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.860" offset="498837">The Respondents here are six employees of the Department of the Navy or their representatives who left WS blue collar jobs to accept white collar jobs covered by the General Schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.019" offset="551395">After an administrative error that had given five of these employees a one step pay increase, after that error was corrected, their starting salaries in their new GS jobs were correctly established under regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management, issued pursuant to 5 USC 5334(a), according to the so called highest previous rate rule, which places the employee at the nearest step above his old salary.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.462" offset="721191">Well, promotion has been used as a term of art in some ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.100" offset="739790">There was a promotion under the regulations under the Office of Personnel Management, because such promotion is defined in terms of whether the employee receives an increase in pay when his new salary is established, and that in fact occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.926" offset="799036">As to whether they were promotions in sort of the layman's sense to a position of higher responsibility, that really hasn't been developed that much in the record, but there is no reason for this Court to assume that they were not.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.530" offset="1025465">No, we don't contend that... they are certainly classified as promotions by the Navy, and that is because of this regulation, which depends on whether they receive a salary increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.405" offset="1073008">They are certainly promotions within the meaning of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.190" offset="1084084">And as to whether they are promotions in a more common sense matter, I don't think that has really been determined, but we don't contest that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.245" offset="1120342">We have never argued that they are not.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.534" offset="1161511">5334(a) and (b) also refer to transfers in there, so--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="264.988" offset="1183349">Well, if that is the case, and I must concede that for a court of supposedly nine generalists, this is a very difficult case, because of the very technical civil service and OPM regulations, didn't the Court of Claims in effect declare invalid one of the regulations promulgated by the OPM?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="295.859" stopTime="318.975">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="295.859" offset="1306752">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.676" offset="1310096">There was a regulation promulgated by OPM that restricts the applicability of this Section 5334(b) to promotions within the GS system, from one GS position to another, and the Court of Claims declared that that regulation was inconsistent with the language of the statute, and that regulation was declared invalid to that extent.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="318.975" offset="1399225">So it gave no deference to the regulatory authority.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="323.111" stopTime="439.835">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="323.111" offset="1415839">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.813" offset="1426602">Perhaps I should read Section 5334(b), which is the focus of the dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.799" offset="1454501">"An employee who is promoted or transferred to a position in a higher grade is entitled to basic pay at the lowest rate of the higher grade which exceeds his existing rate of basic pay by not less than two step increases of the grade from which he is promoted or transferred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="350.594" offset="1525763">In other words, when an employee is subject to this section, you look at his old salary, give him what is called a two step increase in his old salary, and then transfer that into his new grade and pick the salary that is closest to that and higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.471" offset="1597234">Now, the question here is simply whether this statutory two step increase applies when an employee moves from the WS system to a position in the GS system, as occurred here, and as the Court of Claims held, or whether the statute applies only to promotions from one GS grade to another, as the government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.052" offset="1683542">In our view, this question is unequivocally answered by the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.556" offset="1705589">Under 5 USC 5102(a)(5), a definitional section, the term 5334(b) is defined as a class of positions included, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="408.114" offset="1755849">"within one range of rates of basic pay in the General Schedule. "</text>
            <text syncTime="412.181" offset="1772045">end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.700" offset="1778105">Section 5334(b) provides that the increase in salary is to be measured as no less than two step increases of the grade from which the employee is promoted or transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.691" offset="1830141">Because Respondents were not promoted or transferred from a grade as defined in the statute, that is to say, a grade in the GS system, they do not come within the language of Section 5334(b).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="439.835" stopTime="468.535">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="439.835" offset="1882700">Mr. Horowitz, can I stop you right there?</text>
            <text syncTime="441.535" offset="1889492">I guess the key to it is right in what you are saying now.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.487" offset="1905269">The definition of grade doesn't purport to be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.374" offset="1920838">It says it includes those in the GS schedule, and you earlier told us, as I understand you, that there are grades in the WS schedule as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.596" offset="1961694">Now, is it perfectly clear that the word "grade" could not apply to a grade in the blue collar schedule?</text>

            <text syncTime="468.535" offset="1997534">Well, I agree that the statute says includes, but I think the only reasonable reading of that is that that is the definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.547" offset="2073498">The Court of Claims said that, but that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.830" offset="2078723">A statute clearly cannot apply to a promotion within the WS system, because blue collar workers are completely excluded from Subchapter 3, which contains the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.221" offset="2124280">This Section 5334(b) applies only to the GS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.808" offset="2142566">Now, the basis that these Respondents have for arguing that it applies to them is that now that they have moved into the GS system, they are technically GS workers, and it is their new salary, but any salary in the WS system would not be set pursuant to this provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.439" offset="2329080">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.122" offset="2331797">Those employees are specifically included... excluded, rather, from the General Schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.060" offset="2355621">Again, as I said, Justice Stevens, these employees are now in the General Schedule because of their new position.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.949" offset="2387176">Now, in order to understand the reasoning, I think, behind the restriction of a two step increase to the context of promotions within the GS system, I think it might be helpful to digress into a slightly more detailed discussion of these two pay systems and their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.625" offset="2453841">The General Schedule is described in Subchapter 3 of Chapter 53 in the civil service statute, and as it exists today, it is derived largely from the Classification Act of 1949, and it was at that time, in 1949, when Section 5334(b) was first enacted, although it originally provided for only one step increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.791" offset="2546523">The GS system is divided into 18 different grades, most of which are divided... further subdivided into ten steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.313" offset="2580587">Now, there is an overlap between steps in the GS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.831" offset="2598664">That is, while any higher grade, the same step in any two grades, the higher grade will be a higher salary, for example a Grade 14 Step 1 salary will be higher than a Grade 13 Step 1 salary, at the higher steps of a particular grade, the salary can be higher than a lower step of a higher grade, or to give in example, again, a 13 Step 6 employee would be making a higher salary than a 14 Step 1 employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.836" offset="2726664">There are two ways in which employees can move to different classifications in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.658" offset="2758011">First of all, they can be given step increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.610" offset="2769818">The statute defines the waiting period for which an employee must wait to get a step increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.447" offset="2797090">That is between one to three years, depending on the level he is at, but once he satisfies that waiting period, he is given a step increase as long as he has performed satisfactorily in his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.755" offset="2846409">Getting a step increase does not mean any increase in responsibility or level of difficulty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="727.702" offset="3034177">Well, in 1949, the only reference to the... in that 1949 Act to the WS system was a one sentence exclusion excluding blue collar workers from the operation of the statute, and stating that their salaries are to be determined according to prevailing rates in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.366" offset="3108783">Now, that was done administratively by each individual agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.668" offset="3126024">Each agency ran its own WS system, so to speak, conducted its own wage surveys, and determined what the proper salary for a particular position was.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.906" offset="3166984">The result of this was something of a hodge podge.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.625" offset="3177851">But as I understand it, most of the agencies did have a system that included something called grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.531" offset="3205436">The number of grades varied from agency to agency, and a particular job would vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.599" offset="3225707">They did not all have steps in the sense that there is now in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.437" offset="3249113">Some of them had three steps within a grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.741" offset="3262278">Some just had grades without steps at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.893" offset="3282967">The other way that a person can move in the GS system is by getting a promotion to a job that entails more responsibility, and in this case he would move up to a higher grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.503" offset="3337407">Now, the operation of Section 5334(b) comes into effect when an employee is promoted from a high step at one grade to the next grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.876" offset="3386830">For example, if an employee were promoted from a Step... a Grade 13 Step 5 position, if he were simply promoted to the lowest step in the next grade, a 14 Step 1, he would actually get a decrease in salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.972" offset="3451196">So, under Section 5334(b), what is done is, you give him a two step increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.476" offset="3477214">That is, he was a 13 Step 5, you looked at what the dollar figure would be for a 13 Step 7, and that dollar figure is then plugged into the GS 14 levels, and he is given the next highest step.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.499" offset="3529354">In this example, he would become a 14, Step 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.670" offset="3546073">Now, the Wage System, although it parallels the GS system to some degrees, is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.626" offset="3581808">As it exists now, it is set out in Subchapter 4 of Chapter 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.745" offset="3602288">These are amendments that were enacted substantially in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.399" offset="3620992">The main difference between the two systems is that the WS system is based on prevailing rates in the industry, and varies widely over geographic areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.273" offset="3664460">An employee performing the same job in Columbus, Georgia, will be making a much lower salary than an employee who is performing the same job in Detroit, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.812" offset="3706569">GS salaries are uniform nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.214" offset="3720257">Now, as I mentioned before, at the time the Classification Act was first enacted, there was no coordinated WS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.453" offset="3753172">Each agency ran its own system, and the mechanics of each system varied.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.690" offset="3778145">Some grades had steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.892" offset="3786922">Some grades did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.578" offset="3793714">In the late 1960s, it was decided that the system should be coordinated, and pursuant to a directive by President Johnson, the agencies got together and developed a coordinated Wage System that extended uniformly throughout all the agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.420" offset="3853064">Again, this system is not uniform throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.805" offset="3870618">There are geographical differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.324" offset="3880649">In 1972, the coordinated system was enacted into the statute, with certain changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.495" offset="3905309">One of the changes is that the original coordinated system had only three steps per grade, and now the statute provides for five steps per grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.601" offset="3941776">One other difference between the WS system and the GS system is that the waiting periods for step increases in the Wage System are significantly shorter.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.809" offset="3982631">Thus, while it would take an employee who starts at a GS Step 1 18 years to become a GS Step 10, in the Wage System it would take only six years to move from the lowest step to the highest step.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.049" offset="4035503">Now, I think it is the recent development of this formal WS system and its juxtaposition in the statute next to the GS system that has made plausible on a quick glance the Respondent's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.476" offset="4089211">This is a contention, I think, that could hardly have been suggested by examining the statute as it was first enacted by Congress in 1949, namely, that an employee who moves from a WS grade to a GS grade is entitled to a salary increase of two steps in his old WS grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.087" offset="4159741">To repeat what I said earlier, this contention could not possibly be squared with the express terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.491" offset="4185341">Section 5334(b) specifies that the salary increase be computed based on the employee's steps in his old grade, and 3, the GS section... "grade" is defined as a rate of pay in the General Schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.655" offset="4266007">The Respondents do not have an old grade in this sense on which the salary can be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.559" offset="4289622">They are newcomers to the GS system, and the statute by its terms can only be applied to GS veterans, people who are both promoted from and promoted to a GS position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.616" offset="4337792">The only way around this is to rewrite the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.834" offset="4354719">Now, it is no accident that the statute has this limitation on the two step increase provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.922" offset="4383036">The purposes of the two step increase are directly relevant to this context of promotions within the GS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.744" offset="4414278">Because of the overlap between grades, it is a common problem in promotions within the GS system that an employee would not receive a salary increase without the two step increase provision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1085.921" stopTime="1103.230">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1085.921" offset="4467046">When you say the overlap between grades, you refer back to the fact that a GS 13, Step 10, might be receiving more salary than a GS 14, Step 1?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1103.230" stopTime="1131.897">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="1103.230" offset="4536323">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.413" offset="4544995">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.948" offset="4551160">Now, the reason that Congress was concerned about this is that in many cases it would be better without the two step increase for an employee, for his own salary reasons, to stay in his previous job and refuse the promotion, and continue to get step increases in his old job rather than take a promotion and get either a lesser salary or a salary that he would not get as much of an increase in.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1131.897" stopTime="1140.786">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1131.897" offset="4650948">But when they enter a new grade, at or near the bottom, their step increases become more frequent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="1140.786" stopTime="1398.171">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="1140.786" offset="4686474">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.871" offset="4694834">The step increases are more frequent at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.890" offset="4702879">Over a long period of time, he might wall be better off anyway taking the promotion, but in the short term he would be worse off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.311" offset="4732554">Now, because moving from WS to the GS system is really moving into a different job, the same overlap considerations are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.369" offset="4776858">In particular, it is important to note that an employee who moves from one grade in the GS system to a higher grade is by definition receiving a promotion as we talked about earlier, that is, a promotion in the common sense notion of moving to a position of higher responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.015" offset="4859405">This is not necessarily so when you move from the WS system to the GS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.252" offset="4880407">Many of the jobs are simply not comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.954" offset="4895141">As I said, in this case, we have not contended, it has not really been litigated whether there was an increase in responsibility here, but as far as Congress's intent in passing the statute, there was no need for them to provide an automatic two step increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.730" offset="4954282">Similarly, looking at the 1949 statute, there is no reason to believe that Congress intended to cover WS employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.438" offset="5001093">Back in 1949, Congress was not focusing at all on the WS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.359" offset="5020737">It merely excluded them from the provisions of the Classification Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.227" offset="5040277">Moreover, because the two step increase depends on the steps in the employee's prior grade, it would have made no sense to apply it to employees coming from the WS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.119" offset="5087820">As I said, the WS system at that time was something of a hodge podge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.588" offset="5105687">Many of the grades did not have steps at all, and if Congress had applied this provision to the WS system, it really would not have known what sort of increases it was guaranteeing to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.730" offset="5150305">Even as the system has been refined today, it still makes little sense for this provision to apply to promotions from the WS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.336" offset="5196698">I think the best illustration of how Respondent's contention diverges from Congressional intent is to notice that the steps, the gradations within the grades in the WS system are larger than the gradations within the GS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.731" offset="5266288">The statute sets the steps in the WS system at 4 percent increases, so therefore the Respondents are actually asking for a greater benefit here than would be given to persons who are promoted within the GS system, which is what the statute was directly aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.961" offset="5339222">Now, the Court of Claims decision rests simply on its placing undue influence on the one word "promotion" in the statute, but there are several difficulties with the Court's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.600" offset="5385720">First and most obvious, of course, is that it omits to read the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.254" offset="5408394">More importantly, the Court of Claims itself conceded that promotions are also covered by Section 5334(a), the general provision that permits OPM to set the basic rates of pay for employees who move from one job to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.234" offset="5488329">Therefore, the mere fact, the mere characterization of a personnel action as a promotion cannot in and of itself determine whether it is properly considered under 5334(a) or 5334(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.410" offset="5553008">I would like to turn away from the language of the statute now to discuss the consistent administrative construction here, which we think is also dispositive of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.317" offset="5600656">In this case, OPM and its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission, has consistently adhered to the position that Section 5334(b) applies only to promotions within the GS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.529" offset="5673485">The regulation was first published in 1950, only one year after the statute was enacted, and it has not been altered since.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.421" offset="5833041">Now, the reason that the language has been changed from employees under the Classification Act to employees in the General Schedule is that in 1949 and for a short period thereafter, the Classification Act actually set up two schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.097" offset="5899705">There was a separate schedule called a crafts protection schedule, I believe, and Section 5334(b) also applied to employees in that schedule by the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.738" offset="5950278">In 1954, Congress decided that there was no need for this second schedule, and all those positions were converted to General Schedule positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.674" offset="6510030">In particular, in 1972, Congress gave WS employees some benefits that had earlier been given to GS employees, such as the retained basic pay provision, which is discussed in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.065" offset="6559663">Yet it did not enact any provision providing for an automatic increase, both... either from WS to GS positions or even for promotions within the WS system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.153" offset="6603967">Moreover, to the extent that there is any ambiguity in Section 5334(b), this seems to be a classic case of deferring to the agency's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.328" offset="6648688">It is a specialized area where the agency has developed a particular expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.982" offset="6667287">The regulations are contemporaneous with the enactment of the statute, and are long standing and consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.319" offset="6696649">Indeed, the Classification Act of 1949 was based on bills that were submitted by the agency involved here, the Civil Service Commission, and the legislative history reflects the Commission's view that this section was in accord with its views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.411" offset="6757044">It is hard to imagine a more well established interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.880" offset="6770837">It has never seriously been challenged for 30 years, and indeed, even in this litigation, the Respondents did not allege that the two step increase applied to them until some time after their petition in the Court of Claims was filed, because if you examine the petition that is reprinted in the appendix, you will see that they at that time asked only for the one step increases that had mistakenly been given to them by the agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.911" offset="7078977">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Respondents do in fact focus upon the plain language of the statute, and we contend that there is in fact no ambiguity whatsoever, that in point of fact employees promoted to a higher grade are entitled to the pay implementation provisions of 5334(b), and so the Court of Claims has found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.597" offset="7201753">We suggest that we can focus upon the fact that these people are employees, we can focus upon the fact that they were in fact promoted to a higher grade position, and therefore the pay implementation provisions should follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.475" offset="7265283">Now, it is important to ascertain at the outset that each Respondent here was in fact promoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.814" offset="7298615">The promotion didn't come after the pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.464" offset="7309168">The promotion was in point of fact what took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.902" offset="7322961">That was the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.968" offset="7331216">Now, the Wage System has grades and had grades and had grades way back to immediately post World War Two period, just as the General Schedule had grades and has had grades for an extensive period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.946" offset="7399134">In like fashion, the Wage System has steps, and we point out in our briefing and the Court below appropriately found that each of these Respondents was in fact promoted from one position to a higher position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.825" offset="7466634">This was conceded below, and the mechanics of going beneath or behind the personnel action of promotion was never raised, nor does the administrative record support any position that it could have been raised, because these were in fact promotions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.971" offset="7547196">Yes, the mechanics of the promotion, they were from one system to another, but in point of fact, in examining the administrative record, it is clear that each of these Respondents applied under a merit promotion advertisement program for a position at a higher grade, and each was in fact selected by reason of the qualifications which the employee had demonstrated in the journeyman level as a wage scale employee or Wage System employee at the lower level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.443" offset="7677077">So, there was in fact an individualized treatment, if you would, for each of these individuals, and this is the critical part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.298" offset="7712499">We must focus upon the fact that the statute refers to two actions, promotions and transfers to a higher grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.071" offset="7747607">Now, transfer, of course, involves moving from one agency to another or from one branch of the government to another, so you would be transferred to a higher grade position, but each of those types of actions which are set forth in the statute concern the individual employee, and it must be contrasted with the mass program of conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.418" offset="7837051">If a group of jobs or positions are converted from one type to another, the statute would not be applicable, because it does not involve the individualized concept of promotion, and in this case each of these boys did in fact move from the position of ship surveyor in the Wage System up to a position of quality assurance specialist, supervisory production controller, engineering technician, and the like, and each was in fact selected following selective processes which are peculiar to the selection process, in competition with other employees, and that is why in point of fact below there was never any contention as to whether this was in fact a promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.981" offset="8027327">Now, our position, of course, is that the Civil Service Commission regulation, now the Office of Personnel Management, is contrary to the language and intent in Congress when it limits--</text>

            <text syncTime="2618.343" offset="10596731">Mr. Proto was one of the Respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.411" offset="10617002">In 1968, he, as a Wage System employee, was promoted to General Schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.234" offset="10644274">Then he was changed back to lower grade pursuant to a reduction in force, and at that time they called it a change to lower grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.838" offset="10678755">He moved from a higher grade position in the General Schedule back to the lower grade Wage System position, and the courts... I mean, and the agency, its own personnel officials, so described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.814" offset="10726612">Then, later on, he moved back up again, and then he was demoted back, and finally the action which is before the Court now, part of it 1973, he was promoted again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.286" offset="10772483">So, long before 1972, the agency itself, this very agency was using the grade concept to apply Wage System... to apply to Wage System employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.613" offset="10825772">Now, the point here is that the discretion isn't in the paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.866" offset="10850850">The discretion occurs in the selecting official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.237" offset="10868300">The personnel official and the operating officials who call it a promotion then set up the criteria for the employee to be paid, and this necessarily follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.609" offset="10909782">Now, the point has been made that the 1972 legislation impliedly in some way gave rise to an approval of the regulations which the Civil Service Commission had promulgated, and this just isn't so, because if we contrast it with the 1954 legislation, which has been called to the Court's attention, involving the movement of these crafts, protective, and custodial employees into the General Schedule, Congress at that time specifically stated that they would not be involved or would not be construed, or these actions, I should say, this conversion, Congress said specifically shall not be construed to be transfers or promotions within the meaning of 802, which is the predecessor to 5334(b) of the Classification Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.296" offset="11132554">So, Congress, if they meant that here, in the case of the Wage System employees, could have said the same thing, but because they didn't, the obvious intent of Congress, we submit, was in point of fact to include them, and so the Court of Claims found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.872" offset="11194830">Now, the point has been made that the Civil Service Commission representative, in making his remarks to the Congress, pointed out that this particular 1949 legislation involved the General Schedule, but we contend that this is not controlling because the Congress in its committee report said nothing of the sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.638" offset="11281870">In point of fact, if Congress had intended to exclude this schedule of employees from any of the language of 5334(b), it has had ample opportunity to say so, over a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.599" offset="11353759">The 1972 legislation itself dealt with nationalizing, if you would, codifying what had previously been under executive order and previously under administrative rule, a national system of wage board or Wage System employees, so that there would be uniformity in grades, or I should say uniformity in step and uniformity in concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.215" offset="11448218">Not uniformity in rate, because the rate depends on the particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.684" offset="11462115">But that particular 1972 legislation did not in any way, shape, or form address itself to the issue which we have before the Court here, namely, promotions, or namely, the transfer to a higher grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.424" offset="11517077">We feel that in examining the 1950 regulation which has been relied upon by the government in its brief, we at Page... Footnote 20 of Page 23 of our brief did point out how this particular regulation has vacillated back and forth to recite repromotions, to talk about promotions, and talk about a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.761" offset="11634419">Our position, of course, is that there has been an inconsistency in application of this... of the statute by the agency below, and the inconsistency was highlighted in this very case, because in one instance they applied what they called the highest previous rate rule, and in another instance they applied 5334(b) in essence, and Respondent Libretto, who was the Respondent below that gave rise to the case which finally arose in the Court of Claims, because he said to the agency, I should be getting the benefits of 5334(b), he at all times claimed that he was entitled to the two step increase which the statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.110" offset="11835771">So, our position in sum is that the Court of Claims was in fact correct in its analysis of the application of the statute, that the Civil Service regulation, the Office of Personnel Management regulation now, is contrary to the intent of Congress, and we submit that the judgment of the Court of Claims should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.040" offset="11927513">A couple of points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.575" offset="11933678">I think a critical point here is that there is just no way to decide what a promotion is under the Respondent's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.098" offset="11971712">To get back to Mr. Justice Stevens' question, promotions in the regulations are defined only in terms of salary levels, and comparisons between grades in the WS system and grades in the GS system are also only in terms of salary level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.391" offset="12040884">Thus, in Mr. Justice Stevens' hypothetical, where an employee moved from the same job in Georgia or in Alaska, where in one case he was getting a pay increase and in one case he was getting a pay decrease, it is clear under the regulations that one of those would be characterized as promotion and one would be characterized as a demotion, and the relevant regulation here is 5 CFR 536.201.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.941" offset="12147150">So, the only way, really, to deal with Respondent's contention is to take a common sense view of the word "promotion", to look at whether the employee has gone to some higher responsibility in his new job, and the difficulty with that is that it leads the Courts down a path of looking at every case, whether there has been a change in responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.937" offset="12235131">In many cases, the jobs are pretty difficult to compare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.553" offset="12245580">I would also like to correct what I think is a misstatement, and that is that the agency here never applied 5334(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.409" offset="12281002">It never gave these employees a two step increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.775" offset="12290406">It gave them a one step increase under a misinterpretation of the regulations, not of the statute, and in fact under the Court of Claims decision, the Respondents here ended up with much higher salary increases than they had even gotten under the original mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.371" offset="12356861">One other point as far as this conversion in 1954 of the crafts protection schedule, as I pointed out earlier, those employees were within the Classification Act, so if Congress had not specified that this mass conversion was excluded from 5334(b), 5334(b) by its terms would have applied to those employees, but as we have argued, by its terms, it does not apply and never has applied to WS employees, and that can just be seen by looking at the definition of the term 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.127" offset="12499908">As far as Mr. Justice Stevens' earlier question to me about the use of the word WS system at the same time.</text>
