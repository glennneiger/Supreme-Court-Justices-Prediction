            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="100.532" offset="478877">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case and United States against Erika, the following case, involve challenges to the procedures established by Congress for determining medical reimbursement claims under Part B of the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.160" offset="549407">The Medicare program is divided into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.879" offset="564245">Part A provides insurance for hospital and related post-hospital services, and is fully funded by payroll taxes paid to the federal government through the social security system.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.337" offset="610116">Part B, which is involved here, provides a voluntary program of supplementary medical insurance covering in general 80 percent of the reasonable charges for certain other services, primarily physicians' services and such items as medical supplies, laboratory tests, and ex-rays.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.833" offset="692036">Benefits under Part B are financed in part by direct federal government contributions and in part by monthly premiums paid by people who are 65 years of age or older or disabled and who choose voluntarily to enroll in the Part B program.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.359" offset="758178">Under the Medicare statute, the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines whether an individual is eligible to enroll in the Part B program.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.817" offset="799974">If the Secretary determines that an applicant is not eligible, the applicant has an opportunity for a hearing before an administrative law judge, and if necessary, to judicial review of that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.890" offset="848353">Now, in contrast to these eligibility determinations, the individual benefit reimbursement determinations under the Part B program are not handled directly by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.932" offset="896522">The day to day administration of the Part B program requires a determination of a vast number of individual claims for reimbursement submitted by or on behalf of some 27 million beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.606" offset="947200">In 1980 alone, more than 150 million medical reimbursement claims were processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.177" offset="973427">When it enacted the Medicare Act in 1965, Congress concluded that a reimbursement program of this magnitude and complexity could be administered most efficiently and conveniently by private insurance carriers, because these carriers, in conducting their own insurance business, had acquired considerable experience and expertise in determining whether, for example, physicians' services are medically necessary and in calculating the reasonable charge for a variety of medical services in their particular community.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.333" offset="1110100">Accordingly, Congress in the Medicare Act authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with private insurance carriers under which the carriers would determine and pay Part B benefits on a reimbursible non-profit basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.759" offset="1171749">Under these contracts, the carriers receive advances of funds which they then pay to claimants in reimbursement for medical services that are found by the carriers to be covered by Part B, medically necessary, and reasonable in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.952" offset="1232562">The contracts also provide for the government to pay the carriers' necessary and proper costs of administering the Part B system.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.792" offset="1263909">In all of these functions, the carriers act as agents of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.694" offset="1283553">Now, the challenge in this case is to the procedures provided under Part B when a claimant is dissatisfied with a carrier's reimbursement decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.534" offset="1322841">Under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, if a claimant does not agree with the carrier's initial decision regarding the amount of reimbursement for particular services, the claimant may require a review of that initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.077" offset="1389087">A review of the entire file is then conducted by an employee of the carrier other than the employee who made the initial determination, and the claimant may submit additional evidence or legal or factual argument in support of the claim at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.068" offset="1441019">If after that review determination the claimant is still not satisfied with the carrier's decision, the Medicare Act requires the carrier to hold a 100 in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.177" offset="1505489">Now, this fair hearing is conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the carrier who cannot have participated personally at any prior stage of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.368" offset="1546240">The hearing officer is empowered to inquire fully into the claim at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.522" offset="1566824">He may examine witnesses and call for additional evidence at the hearing, and the claimant is also entitled to submit additional documents or evidence, examine witnesses, and present argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.164" offset="1613427">Mr. Geller, does either the hearing officer or the carrier have any financial or pecuniary interest in the outcome of the determination by the hearing officer?</text>

            <text syncTime="400.606" offset="1679151">The answer is that if a claim is found to be meritorious, it is paid out of funds that are submitted to the carrier by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.629" offset="1711229">It doesn't come out of the carrier's own pocket, and the hearing officer's salary is not affected in any way by the decision he reaches at these fair hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.405" offset="1778416">Most of them are simply independent contractors who are paid on a hearing by hearing basis, although some of them work so often that it approaches a full-time position with the... with the carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.872" offset="1876219">What we dispute is this notion that they increase their chances of being hired and rehired by denying meritorious claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.731" offset="2143713">Let me put into perspective what we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.116" offset="2153221">There are 158 or in 1980 there were 158 million Medicare claims submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.106" offset="2181224">As... Out of that figure, only about two million went beyond the stage of the initial determination by the carrier and went to the review determination stage, and out of that two million, there are only about 26,000 that went to the fair hearing stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.132" offset="2245277">So the administrative expenses of the carriers would be figured on processing 158 or whatever it is million claims, and the hearing officer would only be compensated for conducting a very, very minor percentage of the total Medicare picture, so the administrative expenses that are attributable to the carrier are very, very small.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.139" offset="2805342">Now, after the hearing officer has done all of that, the fact is, he still under the statute cannot pay anything more than the carrier itself would pay for the same sort of claim in its private insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.697" offset="2851527">I think there is an important point to be made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.149" offset="2861349">We can't lose sight of what the district court found to be the due process violation, and what the district court advanced as the remedy for that due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.172" offset="2897398">How reasonable charge is figured, including the fact that the reasonable charge can't be more than what the carrier pays in its private insurance business, is in the statute and in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.712" offset="2939611">The administrative law judge that the district court has ordered appointed in all of these cases would have to follow those exact same procedures in figuring out what the reasonable charge is, so there is no reason to think that because the hearing officer is appointed by the carrier, that that introduces an institutional bias into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.443" offset="3018501">The... how reasonable charge is computated is not something that the carrier decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.995" offset="3036682">It is in the statute and it is in the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.530" offset="3046818">Now, this care is a nationwide class action brought on behalf of persons whose claim for reimbursement under Part B was denied in whole or in part by a carrier hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.855" offset="3100212">The district court agreed with the plaintiffs that the Part B hearing procedures established by Congress violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.360" offset="3130201">In the district court's view, Part B beneficiaries are entitled under the Constitution to have final determinations with respect to their claims for reimbursement of medical expenses made by hearing officers who are totally independent of the carriers that administer the Part B program, and the district court gave essentially two reasons for suspecting that the carriers' hearing officers were not and could not be impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.094" offset="3237094">One was this notion that Justice O'Connor alluded to earlier, that perhaps the hearing officers have some financial interest in the decisions that they make, and the second reason that the district court gave was what the district court termed the hearing officer's "vicarious involvement in the claim".</text>
            <text syncTime="807.972" offset="3308669">By that the district court meant that the hearing officer works for the carrier that has twice before denied the claim, and the notion is that the hearing officer might be reluctant to overturn a decision made at two previous levels of the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.465" offset="3362586">What the... Based on these conclusions, the court struck down the review provisions of the Part B Medicare program, and ordered that the Secretary afford the right to a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge in the Department of Health and Human Service to every person whose Part B claim was denied in whole or in part by a carrier hearing officer after May 1, 1980, provided that the amount remaining in issue is at least $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.532" offset="3470838">Now, the government has taken a direct appeal to this Court under 28 USC 1252 to challenge this extraordinary holding of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.722" offset="3503647">The district court has declared unconstitutional the specific procedural mechanism devised by Congress to deal with a massive medical insurance program involving, as I said, some 27 million beneficiaries, nearly 200 million in this fiscal year, individual claims for reimbursement, $10.5 billion worth of benefits, and in its place, the district court has ordered the Secretary to establish an administrative review system within the Department of Health and Human Services that Congress expressly considered and rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.359" offset="3634155">Now, in reviewing this decision, we believe it is important for the Court to keep in mind that the district court in finding a violation of the due process clause did not point to anything in the Medicare statute or the Secretary's regulations to suggest that the fair hearings offered to Part B claimants by the carriers denied claimants a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.992" offset="3732689">Moreover, the district court did not point to any evidence drawn from the accumulated experience of carrier-conducted hearings in scores of thousands of cases over the last 16 years to demonstrate that Congress and the Secretary were wrong in believing that carriers could be relied upon to conduct appropriate hearings on these very small claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.817" offset="4199967">I think... I think the Court, in considering this case and in considering the Erika case, has to, in adjudicating the plaintiffs's claims in each of those cases, consider the entire program, and I think that it would be appropriate in considering whether procedural fairness has been met here, to consider the fact that Congress has not allowed for judicial review, but I think it is important to keep in mind that the Court has to find that the administrative process violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.217" offset="4305607">It is not simply enough to sort of merge everything together and say, well, it probably is procedurally proper, but it is close to the line, and since there isn't judicial review, we are somehow going to restructure the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.444" offset="4358478">I don't think that the courts have any power to restructure the system that Congress has devised unless they find that the system in some specifically articulated way violates elementary due process, denying the claimant the meaningful opportunity to be heard, or not an impartial decision-maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.255" offset="4433816">I don't think that the Court will be able to identify any aspect of the Part B hearing system in this case that falls below minimal standards of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.278" offset="4469864">It is important to emphasize, as Justice O'Connor asked me earlier, that neither the carriers nor the hearing officer have any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.249" offset="4597760">One is, it is very good public relations, because millions and millions of benefit checks are sent out with the insurance company's name on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.069" offset="4625032">And the second reason that was given, a more substantive one, is that it helps the insurance companies achieve economies of scale, because they can integrate their private insurance business for... I assume for purposes of computerization, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.129" offset="4673306">They can rent a larger computer, and they can achieve economies of scale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.735" offset="5127732">Even the plaintiffs have not alleged, and believe me, the plaintiffs have conjured up every conceivable, imaginable way in which the carriers or the hearing officers might violate their solemn duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.143" offset="5177365">Even the plaintiffs have not suggested that the carriers might do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.614" offset="5195233">Now, the district court acknowledged that the hearing officer's fee in connection with a given case is unaffected by the decision he reaches in that case, but the court speculated that the hearing officer has a pecuniary interest in "currying the carrier's favor" by ruling against the claimant, because the hearing officer's future income might somehow be affected by how often the carrier decides to call upon his services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.700" offset="5311530">This concern again strikes us as totally unrealistic and fanciful, and certainly... this is an important point... is an insufficient reason to strike down a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.056" offset="5348937">First, as I noted earlier, the carrier has no financial personal interest in how a claim is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.660" offset="5379344">In addition, and perhaps more important, there was no evidence in the record that a carrier had ever engaged in conduct so improper as to terminate or substantially alter its relationship with a hearing officer based upon how that hearing officer was deciding particular claims in favor of Part B claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.306" offset="5453949">In fact, the HHS official who is responsible for monitoring the Part B hearing process testified that he didn't know of any instance in which such conduct had ever occurred or even been alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.531" offset="5502851">In fact, there was no evidence in the record that a hearing officer had ever been fired by a carrier for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.335" offset="5526047">Quite apart from the lack of factual support for the district court's conclusion, we submit there is no support for it in logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.188" offset="5557499">To the extent that a carrier wishes to ingratiate himself... itself with the Secretary in order to maintain its Medicare contract, or to the extent that a hearing officer wishes, to use the district court's terms, to "curry favor with a carrier", we submit that they would have an exceedingly strong incentive to correctly determine the amount of every Part B claim, and to pay every meritorious claim to the full extent required by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.008" offset="5664810">That, of course, is the carrier's contractual obligation, and the Secretary could terminate the contract of any carrier that failed to satisfy that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.380" offset="5702217">In fact, the Secretary carefully monitors the performance of the hearing officers and the carriers in general in at least four different ways, perhaps the most important of which is that every three months, the carriers must send to the Secretary 10 percent of their hearing decisions, determined on some random basis based on the claimant's social security number, so that every... and they must send at least one hearing decision from every single hearing officer, so that allows the Secretary to determine how the process is actually working and how each hearing officer is adhering to the carriers' handbook and the hearing officers' manual.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey Sohnen</label>
            <text syncTime="1693.214" offset="6849620">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.372" offset="6902282">The first issue is whether the due process rights of Medicare claimants are violated when the hearing officers who make final, unreviewable decisions on claims appeals serve at the pleasure of the insurance companies that have denied the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.714" offset="6959647">The second issue is one of the remedy, whether the appeal ordered by the district court to the Secretary is the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.218" offset="6989636">Counsel has made a number of comments about evidence in this case, and I think it is important to understand that the standard that this Court has recognized about the requirement of a fair tribunal is that our system of justice seeks to avoid the possibility and even the appearance of bias, and thus the standard is one of whether the circumstances presented pose to the average man sitting as a judge a possible temptation not to decide fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.006" offset="7116800">It is important, therefore, that we grasp the critical facts of this complex program to understand why in fact carriers do have a direct financial interest in the outcome of Medicare claims, and why it is not an extraordinary exercise of the imagination, as counsel has stated, to so find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.205" offset="7205616">As Justice Stevens commented, there is a very close connection between policy decisions that are made with respect to the private carriers' own claims and to their functions as Medicare contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.483" offset="7274684">In fact, whether they are holding a Medicare contract or administering their own private plans, they have the same dual mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.087" offset="7309061">First, they are to protect the funds of their policyholders, or in the case of Medicare, federal funds, and secondly, they are to honor the claims benefit... the claims decisions... excuse me, the claims that are submitted to them under a prudent and cautious interpretation of their policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.369" offset="7402266">If the carrier treats federal funds less cautiously than its own, its own financial interest is jeopardized, as the Secretary has the option not to renew a carrier's contract, which is only for a one-year term, without a showing of cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.380" offset="7466318">Thus, the statute mandates carriers to treat Medicare claims in essentially the same manner as if it were their own money being spend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.486" offset="7502681">In addition, it is important to understand that there is a very straightforward way in which carriers have a direct financial stake in the outcome of Medicare claims decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.228" offset="7553672">This is through supplemental private policies for the elderly, commonly known as Medigap insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.483" offset="7582720">These supplemental policies have become more needed as medical care costs have gone up and as the differences between actual costs of care and Medicare reimbursement have increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.205" offset="7625561">Medicare carriers, as counsel has indicated, have the name recognition that accompanies their names going out on thousands of checks to the beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.395" offset="7662341">This name recognition gives them a competitive advantage in obtaining business under the Medigap programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.769" offset="7703824">Thus, and in fact, the Secretary's relationship with the carriers does not deny the existence of the Medigap programs, but in fact in Article 24 of the contract, which appears in the record, the carrier specifically authorizes the... the carrier is specifically authorized to integrate its Medicare and Medigap claims processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.403" offset="7806328">This leads to an inevitable financial stake for carriers in the outcome of Medicare claims, since when the carrier pays less on a Medicare claim, the result is that there is less paid on the Medigap claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.061" offset="7857006">This happens because Medicare does not pay the actual charges for covered services, but only what a carrier determines to be an allowed charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.667" offset="7891383">Assuming a deductible when a claim has been met, Medicare pays 80 percent of an allowed charge, and Medigap pays 20 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.505" offset="7926805">The supplemental plan, or Medigap plan, is not liable for the difference between the allowed charge and the actual charge, which is ordinarily picked up by the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.061" offset="7972989">Thus, and similarly, when a carrier is holding a Medigap policy and the issue is one of medical necessity, if there is a determination that the procedure is not medically necessary under Medicare, that also means that the Medigap policy does not... does not cover the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.558" offset="8055014">Moreover--</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.832" offset="8092108">Well, the way the contracts are written, the Medigap contracts simply refer to what Medicare has decided, so that ordinarily under a private plan which had no connection with Medicare, there would be the right of review by arbitration or the courts, but here, the Medigap plans simply refer to the level that is set by Medicare.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.961" offset="13416594">The Medicare system is distinguished by the wide range of issues that are covered, and so... and it also... and it is also important to note that the 27 million individuals in this system are elderly for the most part, or disabled, and that the kinds of claims in their very nature often don't lead to extensive litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.595" offset="13519099">As I was indicating before in my response pertaining to the Erika decision and the idea of review in the court of claims, there are certain... there are some kinds of cases that simply don't generate massive litigation, but to... but to draw the inference that a system is completely fair because... because it is not used is, I think, a not completely wise position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.714" offset="13639576">I think, if I could continue with the... the statement... my concerns about the originality of this system, the experience of our system with private boards, private operations of this kind has always allowed a wide scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.896" offset="13732362">The Medicare system, which allows no review from the insurance companies, is to be contrasted with private occupational licensing boards, where there is extensive judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.137" offset="13785339">For example, in the case of Gibson versus Berryhill, which was the Alabama Optometry Board, that is a case in which there were bias concerns about the tribunal, and the tribunal was struck down notwithstanding the fact that there was extensive judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.949" offset="13856496">So, in a system, as here, where we have given the carriers not only the first say, but the last say in deciding claims, grave constitutional problems arise.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3461.643" offset="13923370">Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.259" offset="13933819">First, the statistics show that approximately 50 percent of the claims that are submitted to the hearing officer are reversed, and that statistic, contrary to the suggestion of the plaintiffs this morning, we do not for a minute suggest that those statistics, which have held fairly constant over several years, are in any way distorted or don't reflect realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.708" offset="14027546">They also don't reflect computer coding errors, which is what the plaintiffs suggested this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.095" offset="14045100">Most of those sorts of errors are caught at the review stage, which is the second stage of the review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.564" offset="14062968">And finally, they don't reflect reversals where only about 50 cents is involved, which is another statement that the plaintiffs made this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.334" offset="14094106">The statistics in the record, which are printed in the Joint Appendix, show that the average amount at issue, the average amount that is reversed at these hearings is about $200, which is a very substantial amount when, as my opponent just answered in response to Justice Stevens' question, the amount at issue in any of these hearings total is about $600, and even that overstates the actual amount of each claim, because claims can be aggregated over a six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.718" offset="14195670">So, we think that these statistics don't show any timidity, on the part of hearing officers to reverse when they think that the claim is meritorious.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.480" offset="14270694">There are various estimates, because of the manner of allocating, but it was several hundred dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.667" offset="14291383">In fact, that is one of the reasons why Congress in 1972 put in... put in this provision only requiring a fair hearing when more than $100 is involved, because there was evidence that the hearings were costing more than $150 and people requesting hearings--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3633.878" offset="14612271">It also occurs to me, if the physician is normally a necessary witness at these hearings, as to the reasonableness issue, that probably explains why there are an awful lot of cases that are not appealed, because doctors do not come that inexpensively.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3644.586" offset="14655112">--Well, the physician is not always a necessary witness, and in fact the record shows that there is never any problem in getting the physician to show up when he is requested to show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.025" offset="14692833">In fact, a lot of these cases are assignment cases in which it is the physician that is actually taking the appeal, and not the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.946" offset="14716552">Now, if I could just for a minute talk about this Medigap question that the plaintiffs raised, because once again it raises the specter which seems to pervade their entire presentation that there is some sort of sinister force at work here, while it is true that some Medicare beneficiaries have so-called Medigap coverage, the record doesn't show that they have that coverage, for example, with the insurance company that happens to be the carrier, the Medicare carrier for that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.294" offset="14809966">Unless they have the coverage with the insurance company that was also the Medicare carrier, even the plaintiffs' argument on its own terms doesn't make any sense, because that carrier, the insurance carrier would have no reason to vary depending upon whether the claimant had Medigap coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.721" offset="14867644">In fact, the record in this case shows that the Occidental Life Insurance Company, which is one of the two carriers in the case, didn't even offer Medigap coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.891" offset="14900349">And finally, there is no suggestion that the hearing officer, who after all is the person that the plaintiffs are claiming is biased, is ever told whether the claimant has Medigap coverage or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.846" offset="14936085">So once again, we think it is another example of the totally unsubstantiated speculation that pervades the plaintiffs' argument.</text>

I would like to leave the Court just with this last point... we don't think there is any due process problem in the Part B hearing appeal system, obviously, but if the Court disagrees, if they think, for example, as the Plaintiffs allege, that there is too close a connection between the carrier and the hearing officer, then it seems to us that the proper remedy is simply to ask the Secretary to take a closer look and pre-screen who are selected as hearing officers, and not to judicially legislate and superimpose an entire ALJ system on top of the Part B hearing system.</text>
