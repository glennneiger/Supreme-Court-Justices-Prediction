            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140702">We will hear arguments next in Jacksonville Bulk Terminals against the International Longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.974" offset="196500">Mr. Gies.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_p_gies" startTime="50.266" stopTime="137.205">
            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Gies</label>
            <text syncTime="50.266" offset="341740">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="54.051" offset="356891">This case concerns the propriety of an injunction issued by the District Court pursuant to Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, to restrain a work stoppage in violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.125" offset="409136">The reason for this work stoppage... the union's disapproval of Occidental's continuing trade with the Soviet Union after the invasion of Afghanistan... is the decisive fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.885" offset="464202">As I will develop this afternoon, it is the motivation for this work stoppage that makes this injunction fully warranted under Section 301, contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.843" offset="512059">We submit very simply to this Court that Norris-LaGuardia does not apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.080" offset="541002">The admitted objective of the union's work stoppage has concededly and always been a purely political motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.221" offset="577574">The concern over the invasion of Afghanistan is not even remotely related to the union's status as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.827" offset="615922">Accordingly, that work stoppage is totally unrelated to the purposes of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.914" offset="644343">The Court obviously has never held that Norris-LaGuardia protects purely political union work stoppages, and the cases construing Norris-LaGuardia, we submit, are clear.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="137.205" stopTime="140.907">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="137.205" offset="689482">What's the language of Norris-LaGuardia, labor disputes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_p_gies" startTime="140.907" stopTime="193.708">
            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Gies</label>
            <text syncTime="140.907" offset="704320">Section 4 of Norris-LaGuardia, Your Honor, forbids federal courts to enter injunctions in labor disputes as defined elsewhere in that statute; and the labor dispute definition is defined broadly to include wages and terms and conditions with the purpose of assisting unions in organizing employees, and in engaging in collective bargaining, and for other mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.926" offset="816333">And I submit that even under the broadest possible reading of the mutual aid and protection clause that it is clear that any effort by a union in order to be protected by Norris-LaGuardia must make some effort at improving the lot of the employees as employees; and that an objective that is purely political has absolutely no bearing under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="193.708" stopTime="200.462">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="193.708" offset="915494">I suppose it could reasonably be said that this would be against the interests of the employees because it would cut down their work.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_p_gies" startTime="200.462" stopTime="370.203">
            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Gies</label>
            <text syncTime="200.462" offset="942452">Indeed, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.045" offset="944855">Not only against the interests of the employees, but the record is clear in this case that this is against the interests of the United States foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.966" offset="976516">And that provides another reason why the protections of Norris-LaGuardia should not be extended to a case of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.305" offset="1005878">In short, it is clear under Section 301 that unless this conduct is protected by Norris-LaGuardia, there is no serious obstacle to the injunction entered by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.295" offset="1053838">It is only if the union can convince this Court to take what we submit to be a radical step in extending the scope of Norris-LaGuardia that there is any case here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.503" offset="1098664">If Norris-LaGuardia does not apply, the ordinary equitable principles warranting an injunction were present in this case, and the injunction properly issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.157" offset="1129280">It is not sufficient, we submit, that there be an incidental work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.311" offset="1149864">The objective of the union is the determinative factor for answering the question of whether or not Norris-LaGuardia applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.751" offset="1183615">There are strong policy reasons for not extending Norris-LaGuardia to cover a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.488" offset="1206602">This Court has recognized in the Eastex case and elsewhere that there are definite limits to protected activity that unions are entitled to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.110" offset="1249130">The Eastex case, of course, grew out of the National Labor Relations Act, which significantly, that contains the same definition of labor dispute as does Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.353" offset="1298031">Under this Court's decision in Eastex, recognizing that purely political conduct is not protected by Section 7, we think that it is equally clear that the conduct would not be protected by the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.446" offset="1358426">A second aspect of policy that we think is very critical here is the national labor policy favoring industrial peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.968" offset="1392490">The major objective of Section 301, at least one of those objectives, was to permit enforcement of collective bargaining agreements containing no strike pledges.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.109" offset="1441078">Irrespective of the motivation for the work stoppage, we submit national labor policy favors industrial peace and favors enforcement of no strike provisions in collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.417" offset="1494367">I've already referred briefly to the foreign policy interference at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.321" offset="1513907">The union here has demonstrated a long history of taking what the First Circuit in the Allied case called whimsical political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.759" offset="1547657">It is very likely to happen again, and the Solicitor General has agreed with our position that the Union's conduct here does indeed interfere with the conduct of American foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.501" offset="1598648">Because of that and because of the other two policy reasons already articulated, it is clear--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="370.203" offset="1621427">I gather the Government's position is that there is a labor dispute here, isn't it?</text>

          <turn speaker="thomas_p_gies" startTime="375.238" stopTime="376.707">

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_p_gies" startTime="379.392" stopTime="422.152">
            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Gies</label>
            <text syncTime="379.392" offset="1658207">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.309" offset="1665835">And frankly, we are somewhat unclear as to the source of the Government's concern in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.813" offset="1691853">They articulate only that Section 203(1) of Taft-Hartley governing the operation of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service might somehow be impacted by a decision in this case that a purely political strike is not a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.472" offset="1750576">We frankly see no reason why the FMCS should get involved in trying to mediate the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, and see no negative impact, more important, on federal labor policy if the definition of labor dispute were clarified to exclude purely political conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.723" offset="1851513">Your Honor, I think that the Court need not reach Buffalo Forge and that it would have no impact on Buffalo Forge, if the Court takes the narrow approach here and holds that this is not a labor dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.803" offset="1931866">The question has never come up directly, Your Honor, as far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.255" offset="1945659">I rely very heavily on every case that the Court has decided under Norris-LaGuardia, none of which extend the protections of the Act to purely political conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.261" offset="1985678">And I submit, Your Honor, to reach the exception of Norris-LaGuardia unless the Act applies in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.283" offset="2021832">And that is our position.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="471.169" stopTime="476.620">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="471.169" offset="2025280">But if you lose that first point, then what about Justice Rehnquist's question?</text>

            <text syncTime="476.620" offset="2047118">If we lose the first point, Your Honor, then obviously the Court must face again the difficult question of when does a labor injunction issue, assuming the applicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.928" offset="2096333">We submit here again that Buffalo Forge is easily distinguishable from this case, and that even if the Court were to extend Norris-LaGuardia to include this kind of dispute, that there is sound reason why injunctive relief was proper under Boys Markets in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Gies</label>
            <text syncTime="507.240" offset="2169580">There are two principal distinctions, Your Honor, that I would make between this case and Buffalo Forge.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.060" offset="2192882">The first and most important is that this conduct is not statutorily protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.797" offset="2219840">It is purely political conduct and not protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.784" offset="2243768">Buffalo Forge, on the other hand, involved the right of employees to refuse to cross a picket line... one of the most fundamental of union rights, very clearly protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.825" offset="2291938">And the Court there necessarily had to grapple with the competing tensions of statutorily protected conduct on one hand, and the statutorily protected right of the employer to enforce this no strike clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.518" offset="2682730">The work stoppage grew out of an affirmative act of the employer of these particular employees; that is, the decision to continue trading in Soviet cargo after the invasion of Afghanistan.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.329" offset="2757962">Buffalo Forge, on the other hand, involved a sympathy strike in support of other employees, not within that collective bargaining relationship that the employer sought to force through an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.073" offset="2808953">It's understandable in that kind of a case that the Court might indeed conclude that the arbitrator could not resolve the underlying dispute, because the underlying dispute was the complaint of another group of employees against that employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.249" offset="2869662">Here, there is no other group of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.349" offset="2878021">Here, the only issue between the employer and the union is whether or not we can force these employees to handle Russian cargo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.934" offset="5116402">It's clear to me that pursuing either damages or discipline of employees does nothing to promote industrial harmony and does everything in fact to exacerbate industrial strife, which we submit is totally contrary to the purposes of national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.443" offset="5182439">In fact, we think that this is probably the most ironic kind of no strike clause violation that the Court could ever see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.215" offset="5213473">In the typical case the union strikes because of something the employer does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.567" offset="5230922">The employer, as in Boys Markets, assigns supervisors to do what the union considers to be bargaining unit work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.090" offset="5257045">The union has a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.323" offset="5265926">They claim that the company has violated the contract warranting them to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.042" offset="5276793">In this case if you believe the union, the employer here had absolutely nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.898" offset="5304274">They claim their dispute is solely with the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.933" offset="5316395">And if you believe that argument, here we have a situation where an employer had absolutely nothing to do with causing the breach of the no strike clause in the first instance, and he cannot obtain an injunction, whereas if he had done something to precipitate it in the first place, he could obtain an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.943" offset="5380447">And our view is that that again is inconsistent with the goals of national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.179" offset="5405316">The concern about Buffalo Forge to the effect that there might be usurpation of the arbitrator in the event that a pre arbitration injunction were issued in this case we think mischaracterizes the real concern of what federal courts do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.224" offset="5477518">In every Boys Markets case we submit a federal court has to examine two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.545" offset="5498834">The court must look first to see whether or not the strike does indeed violate the no strike clause, because if the no strike clause excepts from its prohibition certain kinds of conduct, then there is obviously nothing to enjoin in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.804" offset="5559856">Secondly, of course, the court in a Boys Markets situation must look to see whether or not there is an independent underlying dispute, as has been interpreted in Buffalo Forge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.462" offset="5606459">In neither situation does the court's initial interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement usurp the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.885" offset="5636238">It is merely that initial determination of arbitrability that the Court has required federal courts to take since the Steelworkers trilogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.741" offset="5671660">And in our view, allowing a pre arbitration injunction in this case would in no way either cause an influx of cases into the federal courts or amount to a usurpation of the arbitration function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.500" offset="5730697">The vice with the way the lower courts have interpreted Buffalo Forge is, very frankly, the notion of coterminous application of the no strike clause in the arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.641" offset="5783255">It must be remembered that the genesis of the quid pro quo coterminous application theory was this Court's decisions in Gateway Coal and Lucas Flour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.764" offset="5823693">Both of those cases involved implied, not express, no strike clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.834" offset="5843964">And while it may make sense there, and probably does make sense there, to imply a no strike clause only as broad as the arbitration provision, where you have an express no strike clause that on its face obligates the union not to strike for any reason whatsoever, that is beyond arbitrable questions, that it is imperative that the Court analyze, as admonished in Gateway Coal, that provision separately and distinct from the arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.437" offset="5962351">Here, of course, in this case the arbitration provision is also very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.491" offset="5982622">It is not limited to grievances over terms and conditions of the contract, but it covers all matters under dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.780" offset="8667801">It is in aid of arbitration, not in aid of stopping strikes, of keeping people from being involved in management rights or anything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.219" offset="8713567">So that this Court in Buffalo Forge held that if the underlying dispute, if the thing over which the union is striking cannot be resolved by arbitration, then Boys Market doesn't apply; because all you would be doing by granting an injunction would be enforcing some substantive provision of the contract other than the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.918" offset="8808340">But the Court also recognized that even though the underlying dispute cannot be arbitrated, the union's action in response to that dispute could violate a broad no strike clause, and that's where the no strike clause comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.278" offset="8873750">If you had a narrow no strike clause, let us say as we did in the case in the Northern District of New York, which is, I think, attached to one of the papers before the Court, the no strike clause merely said the union won't strike while arbitration is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.870" offset="8932160">But once you find there can't be any arbitration going on over the invasion of Afghanistan, the no strike clause is never triggered, and the District Court very quickly dismissed the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.978" offset="14068565">In response to Justice Powell's question, it is very conceivable that domestic political disputes may indeed arise, and that raises the point of who has control over the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.701" offset="14107435">If a union strikes to protest a political contribution made by the employer, the employer in theory could resolve that dispute by giving the money to some other candidate more in the interest of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.724" offset="14151530">That to me would be something that is even less a problem than we have in this case; because here again if you believe the union, the employer can do absolutely nothing about the underlying cause of the strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.571" offset="14234913">We could easily have converted this work stoppage to an arbitrable situation... and by arbitrable I mean a pre arbitration injunction... under Buffalo Forge and Boys Market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.897" offset="14284232">Had we discharged the employees and the question then became whether or not we had the right to do so, that would clearly raise a separate arbitrable question as the courts have interpreted Buffalo Forge and Boys Markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.122" offset="14337104">It seems to me that that shows that Buffalo Forge should not be extended to apply to a case like this.</text>
