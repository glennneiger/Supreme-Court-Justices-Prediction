            <text syncTime="6.820" offset="163559">Mr. Wickham, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry T. Wickham</label>
            <text syncTime="59.753" offset="375255">Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court, these cases were consolidated for trial and remain so.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.226" offset="421126">The Patterson case is a class action case brought by private litigants under Title 7 as well as under 1981, alleging race discrimination only.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.986" offset="472222">The EEOC case was brought alleging both race and sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.509" offset="514227">The issue before this Court is whether the Fourth Circuit below in holding that 703(h) of Title 7 did not apply to seniority systems established or revised after the effective date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.820" offset="595520">In other words, the issue is, as a practical matter, whether post Act seniority systems must be analyzed under the impact test of Griggs with the defense of business necessity, or should it be analyzed under 703(h), which provides for intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.942" offset="715996">If the Fourth Circuit is right, seniority systems are no longer provided with the special treatment that the Congress very clearly gave them in enacting 703(h) of Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.955" offset="808052">Our position simply is that the plain language of 703(h), its legislative history, the labor policy, and the leading decisions of this Court all dictate that 703(h) was intended to apply to all seniority systems, whether enacted pre Act or post Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.874" offset="919751">The particular seniority system at issue here are lines of progression that are in effect at two plants in Richmond, Virginia, one a Virginia branch that manufactures cigarettes; the other is a Richmond branch that manufactures pipe tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.419" offset="997910">These branches are under separate management and are located approximately eight blocks apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.608" offset="1026645">There are six lines of progression at these two plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.346" offset="1045662">Two of these lines were in the prefabrication department, and involved jobs which prior to 1963 were all black.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.736" offset="1095190">Two other lines involved in this case involve jobs which were traditionally all female prior to 1965, and the remaining two jobs were traditionally white male jobs prior to 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.948" offset="1171990">At the trial of these cases in 1974, all aspects of the seniority system were declared invalid under Title 7 on the grounds particularly that it continued the present effects of past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.646" offset="1266867">The district court ruled that it was fair, that the seniority system was fair on its face, but for the static conditions of the industry and the fact that American had not hired for ten years, from 1955 to 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.144" offset="1348787">It may not even need any implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.231" offset="1373133">But because of those facts, he required certain relief, and for American to do certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.236" offset="1405211">On appeal, the Fourth Circuit, the panel of the Fourth Circuit in what we call Patterson One affirmed the court's ruling concerning the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.798" offset="1479399">This Court denied cert in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.400" offset="1489848">On remand, during back pay proceedings, this Court handed down its decision in Teamsters, which, as we all know, really dramatically altered the previously prevailing rule concerning impact and the defense of business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.567" offset="1606458">Upon moving for relief, the district court summarily dismissed our contentions, holding that the seniority system was not bona fide and on appeal of this decision in Patterson Two a panel of the Fourth Circuit remanded the case as to one aspect of the seniority system, which was what we have called the no transfer rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.246" offset="1773224">This system did not permit a transfer from one branch or one plant to the other branch or plant without a loss of competitive seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.185" offset="1812930">The panel of the Fourth Circuit held that that aspect should be remanded to the district court for determination under 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="432.242" offset="1865175">But it held on its own motion, so to speak, that the lines of progression were not a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.787" offset="1931422">On rehearing en banc, the Fourth Circuit also remanded a case concerning the no transfer rule, but it held also for the first time that since the lines of progression were established or substantially revised in January of 1968, they were not covered by 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="484.025" offset="2072378">They went on to hold that there was not sufficient evidence in the record to determine the bona fides of the no transfer rule, and that they did not have to reach the question of whether or not the lines of progression were a part of a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.354" offset="2161613">We believe that the Fourth Circuit's holding is plainly wrong, when we read the language of the statute and the legislative history which all point to the fact that all seniority systems are to be given special treatment, two memorandums to the contrary, one being the Justice Department memorandum and another the case memorandum, which were both published to answer the specific question of whether or not vested seniority rights would be denied under Title 7, and those two memorandums answered the question presented and nothing more, and said that existing seniority rights, of course, would not be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.933" offset="2431928">All the other legislative history, including statements by Senator Humphrey, Senator Williams, other questions submitted by Senator Dirksen all point to the fact that all seniority systems are to be included within the cloak of 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="600.983" offset="2540179">To hold otherwise really does away with the special treatment that this Court has said must be afforded to seniority systems, because of our national labor policy concerning collective bargaining, and of course seniority is a very major part of collective bargaining.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="630.085" offset="2656581">Well, these systems could still be attacked on the grounds they were bona fide, couldn't they?</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry T. Wickham</label>
            <text syncTime="637.775" offset="2687301">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.625" offset="2690749">It is just a question of whether or not these systems should be attacked under the intent analysis of 703(h) or under the impact test of Griggs, and we say that that is the big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.385" offset="2753756">That is what we are here for, and we say that new systems do not lose that immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.256" offset="2793254">Indeed, employers and unions would be reluctant to change any system for fear that they would lose the intent analysis of 703(h), and therefore it does not further... our labor policy of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.439" offset="2886040">The petitioner's interpretation seems to say that in some instances a new system might be protected by 703(h), but of course our system should not be protected, and the bottom line seems to be that while our system shouldn't be protected because it is a discriminatory system, and it continues the present effects of past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.577" offset="3010592">It seems to me that Patterson and EEOC always come back to the fact that we have got a bad system, but that is not what is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.099" offset="3048627">All we are asking here is that we be tried under the proper statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.020" offset="3080287">We are not asking this Court to set us free, but we should be tried in the court below under Section 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="747.577" offset="3126576">I think that Teamsters and Evans and Hardison all point the way to the interpretation being urged in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.593" offset="3210586">Again, to hold otherwise would be to take away the special treatment that has been afforded seniority systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.400" offset="3265861">In conclusion, I would like to state that the Fourth Circuit judgment should be vacated, and the district court should be directed on remand to decide the issues here of our seniority system under 703(h).</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="814.955" offset="3396055">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issue in this case and the problem that this Court must address is to reconstitute the values that existed as the Congress decided this controversial and critical piece of legislation in 1964, and the question is how to apply the traditional mechanisms of statutory interpretation to this situation and to recreate 1964, a troubled time in American history.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.062" offset="3540460">In 1964, this bill was before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.866" offset="3559686">It was controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.901" offset="3567836">The debates on it were protracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.103" offset="3580689">The alliances in support of the bill were under constant attack, and they were under particular attack in the area that this Court must now address, and that is to what extent were the beneficial provisions of Title 7 to deal with the difficult questions of seniority that were repeatedly used as a method for challenging the passage of Title 7 by its opponents who acted vigorously indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.257" offset="3717257">And thus, the proponents of the bill, considering the charge that this bill would attack seniority, that this bill would affect seniority rights, were called upon repeatedly to lay to rest what they considered to be a canard, that the bill would affect seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.853" offset="3803670">And ultimately, as that debate continued, not only did the various proponents of the bill speak broadly and without qualification that the bill would not affect seniority rights at all, ultimately they found it necessary in order to obtain final passage of this critical bill to add to the statute Section 703(h), which confirmed as a part of the actual statute rather than its legislative history the acknowledgement that they had made that seniority, the seniority principle was a preferred value that was to be maintained so long as seniority was not used as a subterfuge, compressed within the phrase, the provision that ultimately became 703(h), the phrase "bona fide" and the provision that there is to be... seniority systems would be protected if they were bona fide, and not themselves a demonstration of intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.062" offset="4068447">The Congress had compressed in 703(h) its strong desire to deal with these conflicting policies, policy that could have separated the alliance that had created Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.155" offset="4132813">And so, against that legislative context, we must look to the development of this statute as it worked its way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.796" offset="4179415">As Justice Rehnquist has pointed out, and as Mr. Wickham responded, the impact of the decision here in our favor would mean that we would go through a determination as to whether or not the seniority systems here involved were in fact bona fide or the product of intention to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.728" offset="4267187">A reversal of the court of appeals would not end this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.613" offset="4282651">It would merely give us the opportunity on the remand to show what we have consistently maintained, that these systems are indeed bona fide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.238" offset="4325178">But let us look for the moment to the legislative history as it developed through the Congress in 1964, looking at that legislative history from the view of the proponents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.833" offset="4403546">With respect to a pre Act seniority system, it is safe to assume that it would have had impact that might have raised Title 7 problems if you didn't apply an intent test, so that you can understand why an impact test would not be sufficient for a pre Act system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.692" offset="4466971">When you look at a post Act system, one that is brand new, I wonder if there is really that much difference between an intent test and an impact test, because isn't it almost necessary that when the system is designed, the people are going to predict how it will operate, and aren't they going to know whether or not it is going to have an adverse impact?</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.154" offset="4544816">In this case, for example, wouldn't you know what the probable consequences of this line of progression would do and what it would not do?</text>

            <text syncTime="1118.781" offset="4611376">--No, because the seniority principle is a broader principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.967" offset="4624124">We might well be operating in order to enhance the seniority principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.054" offset="4644499">Our intent might be a bona fide intent, an intent not to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.025" offset="4664352">When one views the entirety of the situation, there could be situations where by reason of technological change or the like, there is a need to adopt what could be referred to as a new system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.485" offset="4726210">Well, but as applied to this particular case, and these lines of progression, it really seems to me that whatever happened, and I am not suggesting what the proper answer is, but it must have been quite predictable, and I am just wondering if there is really that much practical difference that you are asking to have the trial judge face up to on retrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.928" offset="4811996">We could introduce evidence that would show... of our intention, show corrective measures that we had taken in the past, and show that we were intent upon preserving the seniority principle, not upon discriminating, and that adverse impact will follow in almost every instance from the seniority principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.426" offset="4897991">There is a tension between seniority and the potentiality of the perpetuation of past discrimination, but yet we can adopt the seniority principle without an intent to discriminate, because we are adhering to the seniority principle, which is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.006" offset="8008235">There are two basic questions before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.625" offset="8018684">First, whether the Fourth Circuit panel was correct in holding that the lines of progression are not a part of a seniority system, and therefore are not entitled to the protection of 703(h), and second, whether the lines of progression system instituted by an employer and a union after the effective date of Title 7 is protected by 703(h) where the system perpetuates the employer's and the union's own intentional, prior intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.108" offset="8136653">In our judgment, it is not necessary for the Court to address the case presented by the outer limits of the rule announced by the Fourth Circuit, that no post Act seniority system is protected by 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.666" offset="8178867">The case actually in issue before the Fourth Circuit and actually decided by the Fourth Circuit was decided correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.355" offset="8209691">Now, we believe the Fourth Circuit panel was correct in concluding that the lines of progression are not a part of a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.175" offset="8236963">In the lines in question here, neither the length of time served in the line nor the length of time served in a lower job is a factor in determining which employees can bid on the top jobs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.172" offset="8324943">So, what we have here is clearly an eligibility requirement which must be met before an employee can exercise his seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.410" offset="8353887">It is something that runs counter to seniority rather than something that is implementing a seniority system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2233.288" offset="9069433">So no matter how much seniority an employee had, he had to have served in a bottom job in order to get to the top job, and because the bottom jobs in the most desirable lines of progression had been deliberately reserved for whites over the years, the decision to adopt the lines of progression operated to freeze the status quo of the prior discriminatory employment practice, so this Court could affirm on that ground without reaching the interpretation that we urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.705" offset="9183014">However, we believe that our reading of 703(h) is more consistent with the legislative history, which I will get to in a minute, and with the underlying purposes of Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.875" offset="9215719">If you have to adopt a plain meaning, which is what the union and company observe, or ask you to do, we think the government's plain meaning is certainly more reasonable than the company's plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.349" offset="9269636">We submit the second question assumes that the lines of progression are part of a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.503" offset="9290220">We submit that in enacting 703(h), Congress did not intend to protect this system here, because the actual overt and departmental segregation which has confined blacks to these prefab department jobs until 1963 was modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.528" offset="9358347">The racially motivated discrimination continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.630" offset="9370782">Until 1968 black employees were excluded from white jobs by intentional discriminatory policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.320" offset="9397531">As I indicated, the white work force continued to restrict black employees to the black jobs by subjective, unwritten standards, selection procedures, and it was against this background that the company and union in November instituted the lines of progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.330" offset="9457508">Clearly, a post Act system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.781" offset="9467330">And it was these lines, a brand new system, which created new rights for white employees, after the Act, and prevented senior black employees from securing the higher paying white jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.903" offset="9511843">It is these lines for which immunity under 703(h) is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.041" offset="9528352">Now, what the union attorney urges is that in deciding whether 703(h) applies to this system, the Court can make that determination by focusing exclusively on the literal language of the statute, but the government has a different plain meaning, so it shows that there is an ambiguity in the statute, and it demonstrates why, as this Court held in Franks, and Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.019" offset="9608287">703(h) must be read against the legislative history, against the background of its history and the prior decisions of this Court, and the context in which Title 7 arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.226" offset="9649143">The three documents introduced into the Congressional record by Senator Clark which were hailing Teamsters as the authority of indicators of 703(h)'s purpose, point out that 703(h) was referring to the rights existing at the time it takes effect, or vested, or established seniority rights, or existing systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.438" offset="9725943">The Clark case memo states that Title 7 would have no effect on established seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.942" offset="9747990">In fact, it makes this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.211" offset="9753110">"Its effect is prospective and not retrospective. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.746" offset="9767216">Now, Senators Clark and Case were the bipartisan co captains of Title 7, and their statements should be given a lot of weight rather than statements made by other Senators in response to other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.653" offset="9814863">These statements indicate that the purpose of Title 7 was to assure the bill's opponents that Title 7 would not require preferential treatment of minorities at the expense of rights existing at the time Title 7 took effect, and Franks and Teamsters, after very careful study, the entire court seemed to agree that the thrust of 703(h) was the validation of seniority systems in existence on the effective date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.186" offset="9916950">It certainly appears that Congress did not intend to immunize post Act seniority systems, and even if it did, it was not the intent of Congress in passing 703(h) to protect a system like this, a post Act system which perpetuated the effects of prior intentional discrimination by the very company and union which were involved in perpetuating that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.701" offset="10003049">Now, on this business about the national policy of collective bargaining, there are circumstances where there may be a conflict between the national policy supporting collective bargaining and the Congressional priority to eliminate discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.192" offset="10056966">When those situations exist, this Court has said that the resolution depends on the facts involved, but that conflict cannot exist in this case, where the industry involved, the company, and the union involved have a long history of actively operating and maintaining a caste like system of confining black employees to the lowest paying and the most menial jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.141" offset="10144842">That conflict can't exist here, where such system was perpetuated up until the very day of trial, three years after the effective date of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.253" offset="11145227">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is our position that Section 703(h) does not protect an employer's decision to adopt an aspect of the seniority system, although it may afford some protection to subsequent employment decisions made pursuant to or in the course of implementing that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.167" offset="11224953">This is not a belated position, really, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.552" offset="11238432">The court of appeals decided this matter on its own before both the panel and the en banc court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.955" offset="11260062">No party addressed this general issue of whether 703(h) applied in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.009" offset="11284303">The first time we ever had occasion to consider this matter was when the case came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.163" offset="11304888">The reason we take this position is that no other interpretation of Section 703(h) is suggested by the language of that provision, and the interpretation for which petitioners contend would defeat the basic antidiscrimination policies of Title 7 without furthering any of the purposes of the Section 703(h) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.564" offset="11410527">Section 703(h) provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different standards of compensation or different terms or conditions of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.959" offset="11488058">Now, whatever else might be said about the decision to adopt a new aspect of the seniority system, that decision is not made pursuant to a seniority system, and indeed, the petitioners, who place a great deal of emphasis on the language of Section 703(h) and describe it as a carefully crafted section, when they are attacking the court of appeals decision, have not shown any way in which that language can be read to immunize the decision to adopt an aspect of the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.478" offset="11614178">In a similar fashion, the legislative history shows that Section 703(h) was designed to protect what its drafters called seniority rights, that is, the accumulated expectations of employees who had worked under a system and relied on its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.658" offset="11694844">The debate over seniority in Congress at the time Title 7 was enacted as part of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, was conducted almost entirely in terms of seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.901" offset="11747820">As this Court said in Teamsters, critics of the bill charged that it would destroy existing seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.888" offset="11775823">The consistent response of Title 7's Congressional proponents was that seniority rights would not be affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.350" offset="12273613">Well, the court of appeals also said that Section 703(h) does not apply to the decision challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.920" offset="12303915">It cast its net wider, and assumed that even if applications as well as adoptions were legitimately challenged, that its rule would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.943" offset="12339964">In fact, the court of appeals did not need to go that far, since the adoption was challenged in a timely fashion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.864" offset="12367654">That is a sufficient basis for... that would have been a sufficient basis for the court of appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.720" offset="12399105">As I said, the concern of the drafters of the Act, of its opponents, indeed, the language used in this Court's opinions, and even in the arguments of my brothers representing petitioners, has been that of seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.395" offset="12461799">And a challenge, a timely challenge to the adoption of a new aspect of a seniority system simply occurs before those rights develop, and does not interfere with or affect those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.805" offset="12511431">Indeed, typically, as in this case, a challenge to the adoption of an aspect of a seniority system will serve to vindicate seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.161" offset="12552914">Here, employees who thought their seniority would entitle them to certain jobs discovered when the lines of progression policy was instituted that suddenly seniority was not enough, that they would also have to have served in the bottom jobs in the lines of progression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.674" offset="12634938">Their challenge therefore served to uphold seniority rights, not to interfere with them or affect them, and to bar that challenge would not promote any of the purposes of Section 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.815" offset="12691467">There are a couple of points that petitioners raise in opposition to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.802" offset="12711425">One is that it would somehow be meaningless to draw this distinction, because the remedy for an unlawful adoption of the seniority system would necessarily affect the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.693" offset="12763043">There are a variety of answers to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.811" offset="12771507">The most straightforward answer is the one the Court gave in Franks against Bowman, which is that the fact that a remedy might affect seniority rights is immaterial to Section 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.786" offset="12819363">Section 703(h) is simply not addressed to remedial adjustments of seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.309" offset="12849456">In addition, as we say in our brief, under the National Labor Relations Act, which was the model for much of Title 7, this distinction between adoption and application of unlawful features of collective bargaining agreements is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.084" offset="12912568">Justice Harlan, when he wrote that opinion, Machinists Local 1424, saw no difficulty with outlawing the adoption of a collective bargaining agreement, although not its application, even though obviously the remedy would have to run to application as well.</text>
