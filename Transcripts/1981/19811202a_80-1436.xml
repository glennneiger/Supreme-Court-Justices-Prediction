            <text syncTime="65.020" offset="424420">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, these two cases present the question whether Congress in the Census Act has prohibited the disclosure to local government officials of address lists prepared by the Census Bureau in the course of conducting the decennial census.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.170" offset="501011">Baldrige versus Shapiro involves a request under the Freedom of Information Act for the Bureau's lists of all street addresses of residential units within Essex County, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.618" offset="542807">McNichols versus Baldrige concerns a civil discovery request made during a lawsuit challenging the census results for the Bureau's lists of vacant dwelling units in Denver, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.378" offset="593798">We submit that the different factual postures of the two cases should not lead to different results.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.517" offset="618353">Our view is that the language, structure, history, and purpose of the Census Act compel the conclusion that raw census data in the hands of the Census Bureau relating to particular census respondents, including the address data at issue here, may not be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.885" offset="691809">My argument will proceed as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.993" offset="700273">First, I will give a brief description of the enumeration procedures employed in the 1980 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.522" offset="726396">Second, I will outline the procedural backgrounds of the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.490" offset="742278">Third, I will explain why the Census Bureau's address lists come within the confidentiality mandate of the Census Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.158" offset="772894">Finally, I will show that the confidentiality mandate applies regardless of whether the information is sought under the FOIA or under civil discovery rules.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="171.213" offset="849171">The 1980 census, like the two decennial censuses that preceded it, was conducted primarily through the use of the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.975" offset="892221">The Census Bureau mailed out questionnaires for response on or about the census date of April 1st, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.472" offset="922209">Beforehand, the Bureau had compiled master address registers for each of some 300,000 enumeration districts in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.922" offset="955960">In urban areas an enumeration district consists of fewer than 325 street addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.559" offset="986575">The master address registers are bound books listing separate street addresses for each residential unit, and it includes such information as householders' names, the number of units at that address, whether the unit is vacant or occupied, and the number of persons in each unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.724" offset="1059196">The appendix to the amicus brief filed by the MDL plaintiffs, the Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs, contains a sample copy of the page from... of a page from the address register, and I refer the Court to that appendix, if the Court is interested in seeing what one of these things actually looks like.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.841" offset="1135682">The lists of addresses included in the registers were compiled from commercial mailing lists, census postal checks, pre-enumeration canvassing in the field by census personnel, and from direct responses to census questionnaires and to interviews conducted by census employees during the enumeration process.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.552" offset="1214467">After most of the questionnaires were returned, the Bureau conducted two follow-up procedures to check the status of addresses from which responses had not been received, and to check units that originally had been listed as vacant.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.686" offset="1270996">The enumerators were instructed not to classify a unit as vacant without verifying that fact through interviews with either the owner or a neighbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.230" offset="1305165">In addition to these follow-up procedures, the Census Bureau gave local government officials an opportunity to review and comment on the Bureau's population and housing tabulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.585" offset="1350618">As part of this local review program, the Bureau provided aggregate information for each enumeration district, including the number of housing units, the number of vacant units, and population figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.002" offset="1400250">In the Shapiro case, Respondent, the executive of Essex County, New Jersey, filed an action under the Freedom of Information Act seeking disclosure of the Census Bureau's address registers for all of the enumeration districts in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.120" offset="1468796">Respondent Shapiro contended that as part of his participation in the Bureau's local review program, he needed the address registers in order to compare the Bureau's address lists with the county's lists, and thereby to determine whether the Bureau had counted all of the housing units within Essex County.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.565" offset="1538595">The Bureau claimed that the Census Act bars release of all raw census information relating to particular census respondents, including lists containing addresses of buildings in which individuals reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.357" offset="1589690">And the Bureau further claimed that this information was therefore exempt from disclosure under Exemption 3 of the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.840" offset="1619679">The district court in an oral opinion held that the Census Act does not bar disclosure of Census Bureau address lists to local government officials seeking to participate in the local review program.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.647" offset="1666908">The court ordered the Bureau to disclose its address lists to Respondent Shapiro and his agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.237" offset="1693240">The court further ordered that the lists were to be edited as far as possible to delete information other than street addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.985" offset="1720198">Finally, the court directed that Respondent's agents be sworn to observe the confidentiality requirements of the Census Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.029" offset="1748410">The third circuit affirmed without opinion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="405.837" offset="1787594">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.180" offset="1789057">In McNichols, after the Census Bureau submitted to Denver officials its working figures for each enumeration district as part of the local review program, Denver challenged the Bureau's vacancy figures, claiming that its own vacancy estimates were much lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.878" offset="1847780">Denver requested the Bureau to produce address lists of all vacant housing units within the city, so that the city could determine the validity of the Bureau's data.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.593" offset="1886650">The Bureau refused to turn over the requested information, contending as it did in the Shapiro case that its address lists of housing units are subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Census Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.620" offset="1934820">Petitioner McNichols, the Mayor of Denver, then filed an action claiming that the Bureau had substantially undercounted Denver's population in reliance on its allegedly arbitrary and unreasonable vacancy figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.692" offset="1987065">Denver requested discovery of the Bureau's updated address registers.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.815" offset="2007545">The Bureau again responded that this material was confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.125" offset="2024786">The district court, however, ruled that Denver needed the address registers in order to mount a meaningful challenge to the Bureau's vacancy figures, and did order the Bureau to disclose either the address registers themselves or an address list of vacant units derived from the registers.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.041" offset="2096466">The Bureau was directed to delete the names and other information that might identify census respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.394" offset="2297818">I am now addressing myself to the request, not to the April 1st date of the Census Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.972" offset="2316208">Did the request fix a narrow time frame, or was it addressed to April 1st?</text>

          <turn speaker="elliott_schulder" startTime="544.780" stopTime="743.530">
            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="544.780" offset="2343375">--The actual request by the petitioners in McNichols was for a list of the follow-up address registers that had been compiled by the Census Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.152" offset="2380887">Those registers, as far as I am aware, were directed as ascertaining the status of individual housing units as of April 1, 1980, the census date.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.710" offset="2431147">The Tenth Circuit reversed the district court's discovery order in McNichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.159" offset="2464897">The court noted that public cooperation with the census depends to a great extent upon the government's promise to keep census information confidential, and it held that both the language and history of the Census Act established that Congress intended, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="590.013" offset="2524352">"both a rigid immunity from publication or discovery and a liberal construction of that immunity that would assure confidentiality. "</text>
            <text syncTime="596.228" offset="2549220">Our argument, in a nutshell, is that the language, structure, history, and purpose of the Census Act's confidentiality provisions all point to the conclusion that the Census Bureau may not reveal raw census data relating to individual census respondents, including address lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.048" offset="2636469">We have developed these points at length in our briefs, and will not repeat them in detail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.062" offset="2656531">However, I would like to highlight some key themes.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.748" offset="2671264">First, examination of the language and structure of the Act reveals Congress's purpose to erect a wall of confidentiality for identifiable individual census data.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.196" offset="2713060">Section 8(b) of the Act provides that the Bureau, or the Secretary of Commerce and his agents, which in this case essentially means the Census Bureau, may disclose numerical tabulations and statistical materials, but there is a very important limitation placed upon that disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.251" offset="2789338">Even numerical tabulations and statistical materials may not be disclosed if that disclosure would reveal information reported by or on behalf of any particular census respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.746" offset="2851300">This limiting language serves the same essential purpose as the confidentiality provisions that are contained in Section 9(a) of the Census Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.272" offset="2897380">Section 9(a)(1) of the Act prohibits the Secretary of Commerce and his agents from using information furnished under the Act for any purpose other than the statistical purposes for which it is supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.907" offset="2955894">The local governments in these cases have asserted that they are entitled to the address lists because they wish to use those lists for statistical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.995" offset="3016289">But the Census Act provides that only the Secretary and his agents may use information furnished under the Act, and then only for statistical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.728" offset="3023186">There is no provision for use of this material outside the Census Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.899" offset="3039904">And I might add that in a 1937 report by the Director of the Census Bureau to the Secretary of Commerce, the Director noted that it was then the practice of the Bureau not to... not to employ any outside individuals for the purpose of tabulating the Bureau's statistical information.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.292" offset="3169472">In any event, even if disclosure to local officials challenging the census may be deemed a statistical purpose, our submission is that disclosure is nevertheless barred under other provisions of the Census Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.034" offset="3236449">Section 9(a)(2) of the Act bars any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular census respondent can be identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.686" offset="3275006">The local governments in these cases have argued that the Census Act bars only disclosures that would identify individual census respondents, and that they seek not names but merely addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.620" offset="3314817">But this contention ignores the language of Section 9(a)(2) which prohibits the Secretary from making any publication that could identify the data furnished by any particular establishment or individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="816.811" offset="3431532">The point of all of these provisions in Section 9(a) is that Congress wanted to make it clear and meant to leave no room for doubt that all raw census data within the hands Census Bureau could not be disclosed to outside persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.756" offset="7871303">There is no question that they had numerous other sources for the same information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.331" offset="7897635">One of the points we are trying to make here is that each of these local governments is trying to carve out a special exception, a special narrow exception to the Census Act's confidentiality mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.764" offset="7943401">For example, Respondent Shapiro argues that unlike the petitioners in McNichols, he should be entitled to disclosure of address lists, because those lists will not reveal the occupancy status of a building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.711" offset="7991153">The McNichol petitioners, on the other hand, claim that disclosure of addresses of vacant dwellings is permissible because that information supposedly concerns non-existent persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.005" offset="8036293">These approaches demonstrate the unworkability of a policy providing for a limited, piecemeal disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.549" offset="8066490">The next case that may come down the road will seek yet another exception to the confidentiality provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.374" offset="8097837">Exceptions of this sort would undermine the confidence of the public in the security of census information in the hands of the Census Bureau, and in the long run would reduce census accuracy by deterring numerous persons from cooperating in the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.523" offset="8154366">We submit that our construction of the statute, unlike that of the local governments in these cases, is both workable and consistent with the language and history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.269" offset="8193341">Because the Census Act absolutely bars disclosure of the information at issue here, there can be no exceptions of the sort urged by the local governments, regardless of whether the information is sought under the FOIA or under civil discovery rules, and regardless of the motives of the particular local government seeking the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.871" offset="8275783">Under the FOIA, if a particular matter is exempt from disclosure, the FOIA simply does not apply, and the needs of a requester are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.664" offset="8314967">Similarly, under the civil discovery rules, privileged matter is not discoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.036" offset="8332417">In the Census Act, as we have argued, and as we argue more fully in our brief in the McNichols case, Congress established an absolute privilege barring official disclosure of raw census data relating to individual respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.671" offset="8402947">Thus, Congress has already struck the balance, and there is no occasion to balance a party's need for this information against the public's need to preserve confidentiality in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.418" offset="8437952">Finally, even if the needs of the particular requesters here were relevant, they are not sufficient to overcome the important public policy against disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.959" offset="8480165">As I indicated at the outset of my argument, in its local review program, the Census Bureau provided local governments with aggregate statistical information on housing, vacancies, and population for each enumeration district, and as I pointed out earlier, enumeration districts constitute very small geographical units within urban areas, less than 325 street addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.324" offset="8581625">Now, the local review program was established to enable local officials to provide information to the Bureau, and was not intended to provide local governments with an opportunity to conduct what would amount to an internal audit of the Bureau's operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.319" offset="8645573">There is no reason why Essex County and Denver could not have participated in the local review program in a meaningful way without access to confidential census information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.095" offset="8680681">For the reasons I have stated today and those articulated in our briefs, we submit that the Court should reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit in Shapiro and affirm the judgment of the Tenth Circuit in McNichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.918" offset="8735956">I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.338" offset="8773677">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue before this Court is one of first impression, and it is most properly framed as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.428" offset="8805965">Is a bare list of undifferentiated street addresses in the possession of the United States Bureau of the Census absolutely privileged from disclosure and furnishing under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.360" offset="8857687">Our position is that Title 13 does not provide a blanket of confidentiality for all census materials, but rather is restricted exclusively to barring disclosure of information which would identify any individual census respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.807" offset="8915470">That is the conclusion which has been reached by the Third Circuit, by the concurring opinion of Judge Stevens in the Second Circuit in Carey versus Klutznick, and by the district courts of Colorado, New York, and New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.692" offset="8967088">What the county of Essex is not seeking in this case is access to vacancy information, to use information, to occupancy information, or as to units, and it is not seeking discovery, and it is not seeking at this juncture to challenge the validity of the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.903" offset="9043888">Rather, the county's purpose is to ascertain what addresses, if any, have been overlooked by the Bureau, with the result that those addresses would not have been canvassed, and any persons residing within those addresses would not have been included, and the census resulting in an undercount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.976" offset="9108149">The starting point in the analysis of this request of necessity must be the Freedom of Information Act, and that is a statute which stands high in the hierarchy of various legislative enactments in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.016" offset="9156319">The clear mandate of that statute is full public access to government records, subject only to very carefully delineated exceptions, which must be narrowly construed and which the government has the burden of establishing in every case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2626.598" offset="10670689">So, disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act is the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.378" offset="10685841">The exception is one which the government must establish under its burden, and it must do so in a de novo trial, in which there is an opportunity to challenge and obtain judicial review of their determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.482" offset="10742265">The Census Act itself, which is at the heart of the determination which this Court must make, is one which must be examined in the context of the recognition that it is the interest of the citizenry as opposed to the interest of the Bureau which is primary, and that the confidentiality provisions of the statute were enacted precisely for the purpose of ensuring that there would be an accurate census and that individual would participate in that census.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.533" offset="10858458">Section 9, 9(a) of that statute is one which is exclusively directed towards affecting the activities of Census Bureau personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.092" offset="10900672">That is, that they should not engage in abuses with that information when it is in their hands, such as using it for personal gain, not that it should affect the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.506" offset="10966291">Even the petitioners concede in their court of appeals brief that 9(a)(1) is not intended to create standards and criteria for release of information to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.849" offset="10987712">This Court has directed itself and concurred in that conclusion in the St. Regis case, and the express introductory language to 9(a) indicates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.127" offset="11020835">If in fact 9(a)(1) were construed to apply to the citizenry, then citizens could only use published census data to the extent that it was not used for non-statistical purposes, and that is not a workable standard, and it is not one that the Congress conceivably could have intended once information was in the hands of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.193" offset="11133057">So, it is our position that it is irrelevant whether or not there is a statistical purpose on the part of an inquirer under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.803" offset="14411529">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the government's counsel has indicated to the Court the general chronological order of events in the McNichols case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.421" offset="14465968">If I may, I would add only very briefly to his description.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.761" offset="14499300">One of the very important things that happened during the census or just subsequent to the actual census day in Colorado as well as all through the nation is what was enumerated or described as a local review program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.257" offset="14553321">This local review program has been mentioned by the government as being an opportunity wherein the local governments and local officials can participate in the review of the census.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.361" offset="14597729">One of the things that is in the record, and which I feel obligated to bring forward to the Court, is the fact that whether or not and to what extent living units were vacant could not be discussed was not an issue in the local review program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.385" offset="14669827">Subsequent to that, the city and county of Denver did file our action, and have made our request, but prior to making our request, we had a hearing before the district court on our application for a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.287" offset="14721445">At that hearing, we presented evidence showing very clearly, I believe, that the total count of the population of the city and county of Denver was too low, and the total count of the vacancy units, that is, the living units in the city and county of Denver was too high, and that there was a causal connection between the too high vacancy rate and the too low population count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.635" offset="14830846">In other words, they didn't count people who lived in these what they felt were vacant units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.084" offset="14860626">The district court, after having heard this testimony, and having heard all of the rest of it at the application for a preliminary injunction, issued its order which was very restrictive, and obviously it issued its order under Rule 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.313" offset="14913498">It indicated that we could only have lists of units that the... of addresses of units, living units which the Bureau deemed to be vacant on census day, and no other, that these lists or whatever it was that this information was kept on could be... should be redacted to eliminate all reference to the source or the respondent who provided whatever information led to the conclusion or the deduction that the unit was vacant--</text>

            <text syncTime="4831.853" offset="19491718">This had never happened before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.884" offset="19495793">There was never, at least insofar as we can tell, an occasion where another branch of government wanted to have these kinds of things which are retained by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.395" offset="19545844">When this case came to this Court almost 18, 20 years ago, this Court held that Congress didn't provide for that, therefore they have to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.530" offset="19586386">That same situation exists in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.248" offset="19601328">No one really dreamt, as it was brought up by some of the questions that I have answered, in '70 and in '60 that we would, that is, the localities would be so aware that there is a problem with the Census Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.993" offset="19656289">No one anticipated that in learning that there was a problem, that we would start asking for information such as this, least of all Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.083" offset="19692652">This is the identical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.675" offset="19706967">This statute which restricts the truth, this privilege must be strictly construed, just as it was in St. Regis, and in the event that Congress doesn't feel that it is correct, in the event that Congress feels that this is a hole in the dike, that a finger must be pushed, then it is up to them as they get into St. Regis to fill it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4914.273" offset="19821383">Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to make several brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.101" offset="19824727">Counsel for Essex County has attempted to argue that if our interpretation of the Census Act is correct, then the Census Bureau has no authority to disclose even the statistical information that it normally does after conducting the decennial census.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.793" offset="19919499">Well, the point is that Section 8(b) of the Act specifically provides authority for disclosure of tabulations and statistical materials, so long as those disclosures do not refer to information reported by or on behalf of individual respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.396" offset="20001837">Now, the test that we have proposed for interpreting the confidentiality mandate of the Census Act can be found at... summarized at Page 17 of our brief in McNichols.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.918" offset="20075921">And basically what that test is, under the Act, only aggregate statistical information may be disclosed, and even then the information may not be disclosed if those statistical figures may disclose information reported by or on behalf of an individual respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.849" offset="20151676">This interpretation is supported by the opinion of the Attorney General that we have cited in a footnote on Page 30 of our brief in Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.407" offset="20185948">In that opinion, the Attorney General addressed an inquiry concerning the disclosure of names and addresses of certain employees in an upstate New York city, and also names and addresses of people who the Census Bureau had found were illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.133" offset="20272779">The latter group of names and addresses were sought by educational and other public service institutions that were attempting to conduct a literacy campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.360" offset="20345713">The Attorney General's opinion indicated that the Census Bureau felt its obligation to preserve the secrecy of this sort of information to be so strict that it would not disclose even statistical information in certain communities, if that information would lead an individual to identify the particular establishments or individuals that the information related to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.478" offset="20418229">Next, I would like to point out and underscore what I attempted to say earlier, that even a bare list of addresses such as is being sought by Essex County could be harmful to individual respondents, because the address lists that are maintained by the Bureau refer not to commercial properties but to residences, so that if a commercial property contained a residence, and the Bureau discovered this in the course of the census, that address would be listed on the Census Bureau's address lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.650" offset="20574859">Now, the address on the county's... the county may not have a residential listing for that particular address.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.584" offset="20610595">Therefore, the disclosure of this information would identify particular units that are being used for residential purposes that the county or local government may not know about, and such use may be in violation of local housing codes or zoning ordinances.</text>
