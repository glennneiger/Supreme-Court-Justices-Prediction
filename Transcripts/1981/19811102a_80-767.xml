            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="121504">The Court will hear arguments first this morning in the United States against Lee.</text>

            <text syncTime="10.789" offset="164658">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Appellee in this case is a member of the old order Amish religious sect who employed other members of that sect on his farm and in his carpentry shop during the taxable years involved, 1970 through 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.362" offset="302898">He did not withhold social security taxes from their wages or pay the employer's share of those taxes, and after an Internal Revenue Service assessment in 1978, he paid the taxes for one quarter of one year for an employee, and brought this suit for a refund, claiming that the tax as applied violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.166" offset="430167">The basis for this claim is the belief of the old Amish sect to which he adhered that the members are to care for their aged, their sick, and their unemployed, and do not need any form of social welfare benefits from outside their religious community, and that it is a sin either to accept social security benefits or to pay the social security taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.019" offset="557540">The District Court upheld his claim that the tax was unconstitutional as applied, and the United States appealed to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.818" offset="644684">Well, the ordinary enforcement procedures to collect the taxes would be utilized, Mr. Chief Justice, but of course this case has been litigated, and none of those procedures have been put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.310" offset="702676">The case was tried on a stipulation, and counsel have agreed that the amount of taxes owing will be agreed upon should the United States prevail in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.149" offset="862023">He made it under a claim of right to a refund, and perhaps that reconciled it with his belief.</text>

S. Reports that upheld the constitutionality of the Social Security Act itself, and that established that the payments as Congress characterized them are taxes, and not insurance premiums, as is sometimes confused, and on Page 28 of our brief, we have set out the key paragraph of that opinion, and I would like to, if I may, turn our attention to it, because it seems to me to go to the heart of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.040" offset="4865654">There are many contributions made in the community at large that contribute toward the maintenance of the way of life that the Amish have fashioned, and that under Wisconsin against Yoder they have a constitutional right to maintain as they choose to fashion it, but the fact is, it is not only through their efforts that that way of life can be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.441" offset="4979235">There are others in the community in general who are willing, for example, to train themselves in the advanced technology that is needed to defend the Country in today's world, and to protect the constitutional form of government which provides for the free exercise of religion, and others who are willing to serve in the armed forces, et cetera.</text>

I could not identify the cases... was there not a series of cases of Jehovah's witnesses and other groups, perhaps Quakers, who are strongly opposed to war in any form, who sought to have the aggregate amount of the income taxes levied on them segregated between that part which went to the maintenance of the military and the civilian?</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.421" offset="5483084">I think the Court did not decide any of them, but regularly certiorari was denied in those cases, for whatever that is worth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.813" offset="5524671">That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.848" offset="5536792">One of the most prominent of those more recent cases in which certiorari was denied in 1970 is a case in which we have set out a quotation in our reply brief, on Page 3, called Autenrieth v. Cullen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.560" offset="5603666">In that case a large number of people with very serious, they claimed, conscientious scruples against the activities that the government was engaged in in Vietnam wished not to pay the share of their income taxes that would be attributed to supporting that activity, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected that claim, and we have quoted a passage of its opinion, and this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.900" offset="5745040">There are other cases collected in our principal brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.018" offset="5757475">In a way, this is a more serious claim of conscience than we are involved in in this case, and I don't mean in any way not to respect the claim that is being made here, but there is no claim in this case that the religious views of the Amish are offended by the use to which these moneys will actually be put, to take care of the social welfare problems of other persons in the general community, whereas in many of these other cases in which people have claimed a conscientious scruple against paying taxes, they found it contrary to their conscience to have the money spent the government was planning to spend the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.700" offset="5960289">Here, the money need not be spent in a way that would offend their religious beliefs, but it is the payment of the tax itself which they construe to be a sin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.675" offset="6008146">Now, I do think it is important to keep in mind that while the social security laws do use the word "insurance" and use a trust fund concept, the payments that are involved here have from the beginning been recognized to be taxes and not insurance premiums, as they are sometimes loosely called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.919" offset="6169164">This may be very obvious on the facts of this case in which the payments are due from the employer but the credit is to go toward the account of the employee, for himself or his survivors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.227" offset="6226320">Nonetheless, there can be some confusion about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.612" offset="6247950">On Page 16 of the Appellee's brief he refers to this as the payment of insurance premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.200" offset="6282222">Any possible doubt on this subject was dispelled by a decision of this Court not cited in any of the briefs which I want to call to the Court's attention, and I called it to counsel's attention, Fleming against Nester, decided in 1960, 363 US 603, which made it clear that there is no accrued property right under the system, that it is, as Congress provided, in a savings provision subject to change and adjustment through the normal exercise of the Article I legislative powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.777" offset="6440524">From the beginning, the cases have construed the payments due as taxes, as Congress characterized them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.483" offset="6683359">Perhaps it is not permissible and proper for an attorney to become so personally involved with a particular issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.672" offset="6724110">But I think the Court has to remember in this case that religion is something like beauty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.061" offset="6761726">I think that religion is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.146" offset="6770085">I think religion also has to be in the eyes of the believer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.764" offset="6788475">Religion means different things to different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.168" offset="6802164">To some people, it may seam go to church on Sunday, or the Sabbath.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.239" offset="6834451">But to some people the basic and the underlying principle of religion is the salvation of one's soul.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.309" offset="6866738">That basically is what the Amish people are about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.897" offset="6885024">It is pretty hard, really, to describe the Amish people without living with them, without going to see them, visiting their homes, talking to them, and I think by doing that you perhaps gain an insight into what the Amish people are about.</text>
