            <text syncTime="56.837" offset="353052">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.156" offset="374368">This case involves a totally different aspect of the same union conduct that gave rise to the Jacksonville Bulk case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.429" offset="411462">In that case you had an employer suing under Section 301 of the Labor Act to enforce his no strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.916" offset="441451">In this case you have a customer of a customer of the longshoremen's employer who brought an action for damages under Section 303 of the Act, alleging that the union's conduct was a secondary boycott in violation of Section 8(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="98.164" offset="518355">That section provides or forbids a union from picketing or refusing to handle goods where an object thereof is to force someone to cease doing business with someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.589" offset="584079">This Court granted certiorari to review an order of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which by a divided panel reversed the District Court's dismissal of the Section 303 suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.849" offset="641131">There were other causes of action pleaded which we will allude to, but they are not the subject of the proceeding this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.253" offset="662760">The union takes the position in this suit that just as Occidental said so strenuously, there is no labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.846" offset="717095">We are now echoing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.929" offset="721483">There is no labor dispute, because the ingredient of suit on a collective bargaining agreement under a provision to provide labor is not at issue in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.487" offset="763697">The only dispute here, we say, is that non-labor political, and most important, foreign dispute between the union and the Russians.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.795" offset="816883">We feel that the First Circuit was in error when it held that the activities in this case were in commerce so as to be even subject to the provisions of Section 303 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.221" offset="874665">We also feel that they were in error when they held that there was a violation of the Act when in this case there just isn't any primary labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.993" offset="905699">And we also would urge this Court that the activity of the longshoremen is protected under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.730" offset="936628">That's a long way down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.432" offset="943420">Actually, the jurisdictional point on whether the case is in commerce disposes of everything, and you go beyond there to whether you have a primary labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.705" offset="976543">That the Court should get to the First Amendment question is probably doubtful, but I think it casts, if you will, a shadow forward because so much of what I will say has to do with the fact that this is a political, but more important that it is a conscientious refusal to be involved in evil.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.916" offset="1049372">Well, do you suggest you can't give up First Amendment rights by contract?</text>

            <text syncTime="234.884" offset="1065255">That's why we really didn't urge the First Amendment case too strenuously in the Jacksonville Bulk thing, because the arbitrator could very well say yes, but you've waived them by contract, and you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.307" offset="1102976">But in this case it's not a contract case, and the ILA has not waived their rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.053" offset="1397950">--Well, I don't think there is any primary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.338" offset="1407041">There may be a secondary labor dispute; that is, whether we have to work or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.623" offset="1424177">But there is no primary labor dispute, and in the course of my argument I will get to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.777" offset="1448837">But much more fundamental is the threshold issue of whether the activities here are in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.717" offset="1476631">And here the union relies on the decisions of this Court a few years ago, or a whole line of decision really going back for some 20, almost 25 years, but particularly the last two statements in the Windward and Mobile cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.928" offset="1553431">Over a period of years the Court has ruled that the NLRA was just not intended by Congress to be thrust into affairs that did not concern domestic commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.104" offset="1614140">The phrase that the Court has used to denote what was not under the Act is "not in commerce".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="379.508" stopTime="382.126">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="379.508" offset="1643815">But the latter is really a shorthand form of the former.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ernest_l_mathews_jr" startTime="382.126" stopTime="679.843">
            <label>Mr. Ernest L. Mathews, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="382.126" offset="1654264">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.760" offset="1656771">It's a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.776" offset="1660847">And sometimes you might say it's not subject to NLRB jurisdiction, sometimes you might say it's not subject to the Act, sometimes you might say it's not in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.096" offset="1690104">Al the time you are talking about the same thing: what did Congress intend to cover by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.584" offset="1708076">And the phrases they weave in and out, but I think they always mean the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.369" offset="1727198">And the Court has said... of course, the ramification if they are not in commerce and not subject to the Act, then they are not subject to regulation by the NLRB, and they also cannot be made the subject of an action under Section 303 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.680" offset="1800445">Most of these cases have involved causes of action brought by foreign entities themselves against the union who has picked a dispute or gotten involved in a dispute with the foreign entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.238" offset="1854675">And in most of the cases the foreign 7 entity has gone into state court, and the union has tired to say no, this is under the federal act; and this Court has consistently told the union no, it is not under the federal act; the foreign entity may pursue its remedies in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.615" offset="1924161">In Windward this Court held that the union activity to protest wages and conditions on a foreign ship was not in commerce when it was complained of by the foreign ship owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.256" offset="1982780">It was the classical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.391" offset="1987273">The foreign ship owner went to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.910" offset="1997408">The union said no, there's no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.760" offset="2004827">I believe in that case the state court agree with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.528" offset="2015798">It went up through the highest court of the state, came to this Court, and the Court said no, this is not even arguably protected by the federal act, it is matter of state law, and sent the case back.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.420" offset="2063446">That arose in the Port of Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.538" offset="2083926">Then a few months later in the Port of Mobile, Alabama the union did the same thing to the same ship company, but instead of the ship company bringing the action, an American employer who hired longshoremen... in this case the longshoremen were not the picketing people... but the American stevedore brought a state tort action saying you're interfering with my contract to unload the ship, and I believe a soybean farmer brought an action saying you're interfering with my contract to have my soybeans carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.747" offset="2232719">And the union said look, what they're arguing here is a secondary boycott subject to Section 8(b)(4) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.185" offset="2270440">It is under federal jurisdiction and you can't bring a state court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.839" offset="2289039">And this Court again instructed the union no, that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.224" offset="2310669">We held in the Windward case that your activity directed towards a foreign entity was not in commerce, and we can't say that the same activity, just because it's complained of by a different plaintiff, is now capable of being split off or, and the word the Court uses the key word, is bifurcated, and made the subject of a domestic dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.490" offset="2395723">No, leave it to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.724" offset="2404605">I think this case would not have presented any difficulty to anyone if we had had our companion Windward case.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.916" offset="2453402">If the first time that this Russian action of the longshoremen had been triggered was when a Russian ship came into port... and they were on their way when the thing was called... when this Russian ship came into port if the longshoremen had refused to handle the goods, whatever they might have been, and the Russians had gone into state court, I think anyone would see that the principles in Windward apply even more persuasively than they did in Winward.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.518" offset="2579834">Not only is this not a dispute aimed at the concerns of the domestic Labor Act... the wages, conditions, hours of employment, the relations between domestic employers and employees... but it's not even concerned with labor at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.862" offset="2637199">It's concerned with military policy, if you will, foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.599" offset="2656112">The thrust of the union's action is in no way directed toward a labor objective and is outward directed away from our shores a half a world away to Afghanistan.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.740" offset="2712745">I don't think anyone would have any difficulty seeing that that was not a labor dispute in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.512" offset="2739808">I confused my terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.797" offset="2748899">Labor dispute was the last case.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.847" offset="2753078">The key word here is that was not in commerce for purposes of federal jurisdiction and preemption, so that these Russians could not go into state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.536" offset="2799890">If we'd had that case, as I say, the Windward principles would apply, and then there would be no difficulty in seeing that once you had your Windward, your Mobile would follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.491" offset="5699691">Let me first address the issue of jurisdiction and the foreign flagship cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.579" offset="5724037">One essential thread that comes through all of the foreign flagship cases, starting with Benz through Windward and Mobile, is the question, the concept, the issue of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.838" offset="5785059">Again and again this Court in those cases has said it is because of comity and comity considerations alone that we find either the given activity in question to be in commerce or not in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.283" offset="5850887">I think initially we need to step back a bit to take a look at these foreign flagship cases and perhaps put them into perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.758" offset="5892788">To my knowledge, and neither the ILA or the AFL-CIO in its amicus has cited anything else, the foreign flagship cases are the only cases anywhere in our jurisprudence that hold that comity considerations preclude a federal statute from applying and regulating and governing the conduct of Americans on American soil that has a substantial effect on other Americans.</text>

            <label>Mr. Duane R. Batista</label>
            <text syncTime="1513.737" offset="6180657">Which I hope to demonstrate is very, very different in terms of comity considerations than the conduct involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.210" offset="6214616">Now, the foreign flagship cases basically by and large, and particularly Windward and Mobile, involved picketing by Americans right at the immediate site of a foreign flagship and its crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.004" offset="6281803">It was picketing designed for the purpose of either forcing American law or American standards upon the management and particularly labor relations of that foreign flagship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.395" offset="6331331">I think one might reasonably view, and certainly one might reasonably not view, but one could reasonably view that kind of conduct as creating a comity problem with respect to relations with the foreign nation under whose flag the ship was flying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.574" offset="6416073">Here we have a very, very different, totally different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.260" offset="6434776">I think we could perhaps view our situation if we took a mirror image.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.247" offset="6458705">Let's assume that the United States found it necessary to intervene militarily in El Salvador.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.568" offset="6483991">Let us assume that as a result of this a Brazilian labor union interfered with trade between Brazil and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.126" offset="6526205">Let us now assume that the Brazilians applied their national labor law, national Brazilian labor law, to regulate or control the action of that labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.551" offset="6583988">I can't imagine there's anybody in this room that would feel that somehow the Brazilians were interfering with either internal United States law or internal United States policy by applying their Brazilian national law to cover and regulate the conduct of that Brazilian labor union in Brazil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.786" offset="6692866">And that of course, flipping the mirror image back again, is exactly the situation we have in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1650.224" stopTime="1675.792">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1650.224" offset="6726616">Mr. Batista, apart from the comity argument, hasn't this Court in the Treefruits case and in the Safeco case indicated that Section 8(b)(4) is directed to an isolated evil, and due to the First Amendment concerns given that a very narrow meaning quite apart from the foreign comity issue?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="duane_r_batista" startTime="1675.792" stopTime="1928.420">
            <label>Mr. Duane R. Batista</label>
            <text syncTime="1675.792" offset="6828912">Well, that really goes to the second issue which is not jurisdiction but whether or not there has been a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.363" offset="6855139">And I think if we turn to that issue, we really, Allied and I think the NLRB, reading their opinion, are strongly relying on Safeco and precisely the distinction made by this Court between Safeco and Treefruits, which is fundamentally that when a union induces employees to, in this case, refuse to handle a product, and it is reasonably foreseeable that substantial business disruption will result from that inducement, and that inducement can no way be viewed as a primary strike, then by applying the simple, plain language of the National Labor Relations Act, of Section 8(b)(4), you have a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.424" offset="7131410">As far as the impact of the constitutional element is concerned, Safeco specifically drew the distinction between on one hand the substantial business disruption, on the other hand contrasting Treefruits, the slight business disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.187" offset="7210509">Also, I think an excellent point was made by Occidental in their amicus brief with respect to the constitutional issue, and that was there would be no constitutional issue raised in this case if this were just a run-of-the mill, ordinary hot cargo secondary boycott arising out of a run-of-the-mill, ordinary labor dispute over wages, hours, terms, or conditions of employment that caused this degree of disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.677" offset="7352406">On the other hand, if this degree of disruption had been caused arising out of a political objective... for example, protestors blocking exits or entrances to a nuclear power plant... again, there would be no question that those protestors who are disrupting the operation of that nuclear power plant didn't have First Amendment protection to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.744" offset="7468703">So in other words, what we're suggesting is what the ILA is trying to do here is add nothing to nothing and get something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.850" offset="7505170">We really submit and we think that the briefs, not only our brief, the brief of the Solicitor General, the briefs of the amici dealing with the constitutional issue show very conclusively that there really is absolutely no substantial constitutional issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.727" offset="7576641">The scale of disruption on one hand when balanced again against whatever residual constitutional interests might be involved, remember, we are not talking here about rights of individual workers to refuse individually or even spontaneously in concert to handle product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.093" offset="7678100">We are talking about an order issued by the head of a major labor union who has the power... which labor union has the power to shut down trade, East Coast, Gulf Coast, and the Great Lakes ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.506" offset="7755736">And as far as we can see, the only constitutional right involved is that of allegedly a Mr. Gleason to apply his own beliefs and his own feelings; and we feel that that certainly is not balanced out vis-a-vis the extraordinary disruption involved in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1928.420" stopTime="1969.997">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1928.420" offset="7839433">Mr. Batista, may I go back to the jurisdictional issue for a moment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.789" offset="7852912">You emphasize the comity theme that runs through those cases, and the point being, as I understand it, that the American activity that's not protected would interfere with foreign interests in running its own affairs with respect to labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.083" offset="7922084">But isn't there the same comity interest here in that the activity of the international labor association or... I'm sorry... the Longshoremen's Association, ILA, clearly must cause friction with Russia if they're not going to ship goods to Russia because of this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.510" offset="7987808">Why isn't the comity... I don't understand why the comity argument you make doesn't cut against you.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="duane_r_batista" startTime="1969.997" stopTime="2049.097">
            <label>Mr. Duane R. Batista</label>
            <text syncTime="1969.997" offset="8005676">Well, for one thing, the activity, governmental regulation of that activity can only create a comity problem if that government regulation tends to protect the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.958" offset="8077565">In this situation, as we've tried to develop in our brief and also some of the amici, the activity in question can't be protected because unlike the primary picketing at the primary situs of a foreign flagship, which could be arguably protected activity depending on the nature of the picketing, statements perhaps some of the pickets have made, and what not... here, the conduct occurring in the United States, the order of Mr. Gleason, which is the conduct in question, is clearly secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.714" offset="8228553">And secondly, as also demonstrator argued by Mr. Gies in the JBT case, it can't be protected in any event by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act because it's devoted towards a political objective by virtue of this Court's... at least language in this Court's Eastex decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.045" offset="8309950">So for that reason we cannot see--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2049.097" stopTime="2053.317">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2049.097" offset="8322071">Your point is that it's friction caused by governmental activity as opposed to the private activity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="duane_r_batista" startTime="2053.317" stopTime="2182.065">
            <label>Mr. Duane R. Batista</label>
            <text syncTime="2053.317" offset="8338998">--Well, the friction can be caused by the private activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.019" offset="8357807">The question of comity comes into play where the governmental activity tends to protect something that causes the friction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.124" offset="8394274">Here we're going in the other direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.410" offset="8403364">I think here we're going in the direction really of the question that was raised in the Plumbers Union v. Dorr County case before this Court in the late 1950s where the issue was whether secondary boycott applications law could apply to a dispute with the county or municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.740" offset="8480687">And the question was raised does this interfere with the municipality, and this Court's answer was no, if anything, applying the secondary boycott provisions to terminate the disruption furthered the interest of the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.368" offset="8559158">So for these reasons we really feel that the foreign flagship cases are totally distinguishable and apart from this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.907" offset="8601372">One final element which is also quite distinguishable and should be kept in mind, the essential inherent dispute or difference in this case revolves around the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.615" offset="8652154">Now, while Mr. Gleason's order also involves Russian ships, Russian ships are not involved in any way, shape or form in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.756" offset="8696771">We used the example, hypothetical in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.076" offset="8718087">This case conceptually could have arisen just as easily in the middle of Nebraska where on a trucking dock in Omaha a teamster local union order its members not to handle Russian cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.419" offset="8779423">And it just simply escapes Allied what possible relevance foreign flagship cases could have to this essential product and cargo dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.346" offset="8831145">So it's only the cargo dispute and the product dispute that is before this Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2182.065" offset="8854029">Your basic comity argument, though, would be equally strong even if there were Russian flagships.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.570" offset="8880047">I think unless the Court has any further questions... well, let me just cover one point further relating to the secondary boycott issue, and that is that one particular statement that my brother Mr. Mathews made I feel is particularly cogent relating to the situation faced by Allied in terms of the Russian boycott, and that was that a safety factor, he said, in restricting political strikes and disruption of this nature is the union members' need to and interest in being able to eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.073" offset="9110029">The critical element as far as Allied is concerned is we don't have that safety factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.429" offset="9139495">Russian trade is but a relatively small percentage of the trade that passes through every or most of the ports in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.369" offset="9179201">As long as those ports are reasonably busy, the union can order its members not to handle Russian cargo, and those members will lose little or nothing in terms of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.044" offset="9237924">Also, the shipping association employers, as a result of this, as long as the ports are reasonably busy, losing little or nothing in profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.436" offset="9287452">So they have no interest in terminating the dispute, the union members have little or no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.458" offset="9323606">It is only Allied and the interests of American foreign policy and others involved in Russian trade that are adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.230" offset="9358610">That's precisely why we feel it is absolutely necessary to have protection under the National Labor Relations Act to ensure that parties such as Allied can have protection, and the public can have protection, and the national interest can have protection against this kind of union conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.394" offset="9443351">Allied asked the Boston Shipping Association to file and commence a 301 action under their labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.465" offset="9475638">They refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.750" offset="9480758">It just wasn't important enough to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.452" offset="9491521">And indeed, only five 301 actions, according to the union's brief, were filed against this Russian boycott that involved, oh, perhaps over a billion dollars' worth of trade potentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.092" offset="9546065">One of those, of course, was Occidental's in the JBT case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.580" offset="9564037">So we cannot rely on contracting parties to resolve this kind of issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.948" offset="9577516">We need the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="2375.756" stopTime="2908.509">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2375.756" offset="9628716">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.028" offset="9669885">I would like to touch briefly on each of the three issues in the case: the in commerce issue, whether there's a violation of 8(b)(4), and the First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.419" offset="9715443">The in commerce issue, it seems to us, would be clarified if one would pose the question whether a primary labor dispute with these particular employers would be covered, a dispute between the union and what the Court of Appeals called the all-American cast of characters here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.468" offset="9815648">It seems that the answer is obvious, and the fact that the dispute here is secondary in nature doesn't give a reason for reaching a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.026" offset="9873849">It's only in cases where that dispute and its manifestations coincided with the primary labor dispute that was outside the jurisdiction that the Act that the court has reached a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.237" offset="9934662">Here there is no primary labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.022" offset="9945843">Even though there is a primary dispute of a different nature, there is no reason for concern that somehow the Act on the board's scope because of a primary dispute that coincides with the secondary one will be improperly extended beyond the area where Congress intended it to extend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.901" offset="10025359">And for that reason, there's no reason to reach a different result with respect to a secondary dispute between the union and these employers than would be reached with respect to a primary dispute which would clearly be within the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.993" offset="10089725">Mr. Mathews has posed the hypothetical that a different result or the result would be clearer if this were a Russian ship rather than an American ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.718" offset="10136641">That question happens to be pending before the board now, and the board has not yet spoken on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.038" offset="10165898">But what is apparent is that the analog that he draws to this Court's decision in Windward and Mobile does not seem on the face of it to be the closest analog, because those two cases involved a dispute about the terms of employment of the foreign seamen on the foreign ship wherein so far as a labor dispute is involved here, the question is whether American longshoremen will service the foreign ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.615" offset="10324200">That is the type of question that was involved in the Ariadne case rather than in Windward or Mobile where the opposite result was reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.840" offset="10373101">And the Court held that picketing with respect to the longshoremen and the terms under which they would service a foreign ship was arguably protected by the Act and therefore could not be enjoined by the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.384" offset="10439243">And that at least on the face of it seems to be the closer analogy to the hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.122" offset="10466202">With respect to whether this is a secondary boycott prohibited by 8(b)(4), in one sense it is the classic example of a secondary boycott, a refusal to handle hot cargo, regardless of the reason why the union considers it to be hot cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.403" offset="10567348">It certainly, as we show in our brief, within the terms of 8(b)(4), and as we indicate, the legislative history discussed the purpose of 8(b)(4) in very comprehensive terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.615" offset="10632236">At one point during the debate Senator Taft said after hearing weeks of testimony no one ever succeeded in explaining to us the difference between a good secondary boycott and a bad secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.375" offset="10687198">Now, it is true that most of the testimony and most of the discussion concerned what typically had been experience, which was an effort to engage in secondary boycotts in support of primary labor activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.836" offset="10765043">Political strikes were not commonplace and certainly weren't in the forefront of the discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.173" offset="10798479">Minority views were expressed in the committee reports and were supported by President Truman in which they tried to limit the prohibition of 8(b)(4) so as to preserve the legality of secondary activity that would be in support of legitimate primary labor-related activity that the union would have an economic interest in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.961" offset="10929614">But even that effort to preserve secondary activity in that limited context failed, even when it would be in the union's economic self-interest to engage in the secondary activity, because the prevailing view was that the secondary activity unfairly had adverse effects on other employers and businesses that were not offending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.848" offset="11053121">And there is also one indication that political strikes were not wholly beyond the attention span of Congress in enacting Taft-Hartley, and that was the fact that they included in Taft-Hartley a now repealed section, Section 9(h), the anti-communist affidavit section, that was discussed in this Court's opinion in American Communications Associations against Downs, which is not cited in the briefs but it's 339 U.S. 382.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.937" offset="11201496">And the reason that Congress put the non-communist affidavit into Taft-Hartley was because of concern that union officials with an allegiance to a foreign power or to a party directed by a foreign power might use their office to conduct political strikes, and that would be an unwarranted disruption of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.207" offset="11318525">So that this concern was not wholly beyond the purview of those who enacted Taft-Hartley and spoke in such comprehensive terms about prohibiting secondary boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.133" offset="11378293">Now, to turn briefly to the First Amendment claim here, which arises not in the context of picketing where there is arguably greater protection of free expression, but in the context of a union-directed work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.361" offset="11455198">The hot cargo, the refusal to handle the hot cargo here really amounts to an adoption by the union of a trade embargo with a foreign power, what might be thought to be a quintessentially governmental decision whether to engage in a trade embargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.626" offset="11544223">The First Amendment claim of a right to do this is really quite an extraordinary claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.864" offset="11577242">This is a matter that not only is a matter of high governmental policy but a matter of concern to all citizens in the country and to all aspects of opinion in the country, to be expressed through the representative processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.992" offset="11641712">But the union, because it is strategically located to do so on its own, is claiming a right to short-circuit anyone else's discussion of the matter or efforts to influence governmental policy and to decide on its own that a trade embargo with a foreign nation will in fact be effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.589" offset="11728125">This is an extraordinary claim of a First Amendment right which is really antithetical to the purpose of the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.332" offset="11911087">But in United States against O'Brien in an opinion of this Court by Chief Justice Warren a similar's claim was made with respect to the First Amendment right to burn draft cards as a form of political protest and was rejected by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.544" offset="11975870">And this is certainly conduct that has detrimental effects on other persons that might even be analogized more to a First Amendment claim of right to engage in acts of political terrorisms, but one needn't go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.839" offset="12053088">There simply is not a basis for a legitimate First Amendment claim to engage in conduct of this sort.</text>
