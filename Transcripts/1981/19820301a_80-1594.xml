            <text syncTime="80.368" offset="398211">I think the questions of... the question of judicial review and administrative review by the Secretary are two quite different questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.056" offset="428931">The structure and the administration of the Part B program were discussed at some length in the previous argument, and I will not go through all of that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.495" offset="466756">I would just like to briefly summarize at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.780" offset="479817">As Mr. Geller pointed out this morning, the Medicare program is divided into two parts.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.177" offset="665496">As Mr. Sohnen pointed out this morning, if the question of bias goes to the question of whether the facts might be found in a particular way, it is unclear under the court of claims decision in this case how closely it would look into the facts in a particular case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="164.972" offset="736653">But let me rephrase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.772" offset="739788">If we found there was a remedy for a provider, would it necessarily follow there would also be a remedy for the insured?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="172.645" offset="767373">Oh, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.412" offset="770403">I misunderstood your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.278" offset="773851">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.545" offset="774896">Under... under the Part B program, the individual beneficiary can either submit his claim himself or he can assign it to the doctor or other person who furnished the services, but the procedural rights of the two are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.304" offset="825992">The Act and the implementing regulations make clear that the doctor or other furnishers' procedural rights derive entirely from those of the beneficiary, and in fact the Act provides that when the doctor is paid on a particular claim, that the claim is really on behalf of the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.014" offset="892761">So, for purposes of judicial review, as for purposes of the administrative review involved in the earlier case, the rights are the same.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="212.701" stopTime="213.786">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="213.786" stopTime="681.290">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="213.786" offset="931944">As I mentioned, the Part A program provides insurance for hospital and related post-hospital services.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.159" offset="965381">Part B, involved in this case, provides insurance for doctor services, medical supplies, ex-rays, laboratory tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.162" offset="997355">Under Part B, 80 percent of the reasonable charge for these services is paid by Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.899" offset="1020343">As the court of claims described it in this case, the Medicare Part B program is vast and complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.424" offset="1058482">There are many millions of claims submitted annually by or on behalf of 27 million beneficiaries, and largely for... because of the scope of the program, Congress provided that the claims would be administered by private insurance carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.601" offset="1119190">Now, as I mentioned, claims can be submitted when a person finds or believes that he has received services that are covered by the Act, the claim can be submitted either on his own behalf or by the physician, but as I mentioned, this has no effect on the jurisdictional question in this case, but when the claim is first submitted to the carrier, if the claimant, either the beneficiary or the assignee, is dissatisfied with the carrier's determination of the amount, if any, that should be paid on that particular claim, he can seek the fair hearing by the carrier that was discussed in the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.540" offset="1266939">However, the Act does not provide for judicial review of that benefit amount determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.861" offset="1288150">This is in contrast to the scheme under Part A, the hospital insurance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.931" offset="1308421">Under Part A, Congress has expressly provided for a right of judicial review when a request for payment for hospital services is denied, and in that case the review is not in the court of claims, as the court of claims held in this case, but it is pursuant to Section 405(g) of Title 42, which is the standard judicial review provision of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.047" offset="1404970">This provision is consistent with the fact that the Medicare Act, which is simply Title 18 of the Social Security Act, and Congress incorporated the standard judicial review procedure under Part A for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.972" offset="1464633">The Respondent in this case is a distributor of medical supplies used by patients who are undergoing kidney maintenance dialysis in their homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.447" offset="1510504">Many of these patients, customers of Respondent, are beneficiaries under the Part B Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.153" offset="1549375">Respondent would mail the medical supplies, often in the forms of kits containing all the necessary supplies for home dialysis, to patients around the country, and when the patients were enrolled under Part B, they would in return assign their right to be reimbursed for 80 percent of the reasonable charge for these supplies back to Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.318" offset="1637982">Respondent would then collect these assigned claims and submit them to the Prudential Insurance Company, which is the carrier designated for the processing of the claims received by Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.293" offset="1685943">The period involved in this case in particular is the years... are the years 1974 through 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.765" offset="1731814">Respondent became dissatisfied over a period of time with the amount that it was receiving in reimbursement for the supplies that were furnished to the patients, and Respondent requested that Prudential recalculate the reasonable charge on which the reimbursement would be made, and requested that this be done both retroactively for charges that had already been paid and prospectively for the remainder of the particular fiscal year.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.249" offset="1833796">Prudential did choose to make a prospective adjustment for one particular product because of exceptional circumstances affecting the price of that product, but for other items, the carrier declined to make an adjustment, principally because of a provision in the Act which limits the amount of reimbursement to the prevailing for the particular service in the locality during the preceding calendar year, so the Act has a built-in limit or ceiling on the amount that can be... that can be paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.070" offset="1969006">Prudential's determinations in this regard were sustained after the fair hearing by the carrier, and Respondent then brought this action in the court of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.161" offset="2005368">Again, Respondent alleged that the amount that Prudential had paid on its assigned claims was insufficient, and it sought to recover from the United States a money judgment equivalent to the amount of these alleged underpayments.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.969" offset="2052598">There is no issue in this case of whether the particular supplies were covered by Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.371" offset="2074227">This is simply a question of the amount that would be paid for those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.009" offset="2088751">The United States argued in the court of claims that the court was without jurisdiction, because the text and legislative history of the Medicare Act demonstrated that Congress intended to foreclose judicial review of individual benefit determinations under Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.268" offset="2153848">The government also argued that Section 405 (h) of the... of Title 42 as incorporated into the Medicare Act precluded judicial review of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.659" offset="2199406">The court of claims, however, rejected these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.944" offset="2212571">In that's... in that court's view, judicial review must be available in the court of claims of Medicare claims pursuant to the Tucker Act absent clear and convincing evidence of the Congressional intent to bar judicial review in a Tucker Act suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.888" offset="2272340">The court acknowledged that Congress had expressly provided for judicial review under Part A, but not under Part B, but the Court declined to view this omission as a foreclosure of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.428" offset="2318420">In the court of claims' analysis, the express provision for judicial review under Part A simply demonstrated that Congress wanted those particular provisions followed, but in other cases, such as in Part B, where Congress declined to provide for judicial review, that review would be available under what the court of claims termed general jurisdictional provisions, such as the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.127" offset="2409221">The court also rejected the argument based on Section 405(h) of the Social Security Act, observing that it had previously declined to extend this Court's decision in Weinberger versus Salfi, concerning the meaning of 405(h) to Medicare cases in the court of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.070" offset="2473064">On the merits, the court of claims remanded to Prudential for a recomputation of the prevailing charge level in the preceding years, and also remanded for Prudential to reconsider whether to grant a retroactive adjustment for the cost of the particular product that Prudential had granted a prospective adjustment in the reasonable charge for.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.317" offset="2558015">The court of claims rejected as insubstantial Respondent's constitutional challenge to the... to the means of reimbursing it subject to a ceiling based on the previous year's prevailing charge limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.159" offset="2613394">The United State petitioned for certiorari in this Court only on the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.947" offset="2632516">Neither party has requested the Court to review the merits of the court of claims decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.499" offset="2650697">The position of the United States in this case is that the jurisdictional holding of the court of claims is inconsistent with the decisions of this Court concerning the scope of the court of claims' jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.909" offset="2704405">The decision below is also directly contrary to the text of the Medicare Act itself, and to the clearly expressed Congressional intent, both when the Medicare Act was enacted in 1965 and when it was amended in 1972, to bar judicial review of individual reimbursement disputes on Medicare claims in order to avoid deluging the courts with these sorts of claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.463" offset="2842645">The first... the first ground concerns the established principles governing Tucker Act jurisdiction in the court of claims, and as... as to that we submit that the court of claims was plainly wrong in concluding that judicial review in the form of a suit under the Tucker Act must be presumed to exist in the court of claims absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.695" offset="2935536">In fact, the rule is precisely opposite, as this Court's recent decisions in Testan and Mitchell make clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.432" offset="2958524">In those cases, the Court has reiterated the established rule that the United States as the sovereign is immune from suit, except as Congress consents to suit, and that waiver of sovereign immunity and consent to suit cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.392" offset="3026338">The Tucker Act, to which the court of claims referred, is simply a jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.877" offset="3048281">It confers jurisdiction on the court of claims to consider individuals' suits only when some other statute confers a right to recover a money judgment against the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.069" offset="3101048">Thus, in this case, Respondent had... had a cause of action against the United States, and the court of claims therefore had jurisdiction only if the Medicare Act contains the necessary unequivocally expressed waiver of sovereign immunity, and a grant or... or put another way, a grant of a right to recover, substantive right to recover money damages against the United States when the Medicare Act is violated or not followed allegedly by a carrier.</text>

It happens not all that infrequently that an individual claimant will sue a carrier, and the standard procedure for the United States is to seek to have the case removed to federal court, and dismissed on... on the theory that the carrier's immunity is the same as the Secretary's immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.856" offset="3652127">The overall conduct of the contractual relationship between the Secretary and the carrier would be principally a matter between the two parties, I should think, so the... and there is no indication in the record in this case or... that I am aware of of substantial breakdowns in that sort of... in that sort of contractual relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.787" offset="3739899">Now, as I mentioned, under the Tucker Act, in order for the court of claims to have jurisdiction, it is necessary to find the waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.127" offset="3777306">Respondent concedes that there is nothing on the face of the Medicare Act and nothing in the legislative history indicating specifically that Congress intended to remove the sovereign immunity of the United States in the Medicare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.368" offset="3826207">Now, this should be dispositive of the case, because of the line of this Court's decisions concerning Tucker Act jurisdiction that I discussed before, but I think this is particularly so when we consider the nature of the Part B Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.627" offset="3883259">A court should not lightly infer that Congress would have exposed the executive and judicial branches to the possibility of suit without regard even to the amount in controversy every time a carrier is alleged to have made an error in the particular computation of the amount due on a particular claim or the application of a regulation or instruction to a particular claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.708" offset="3971553">These determinations generally involve a relatively small amount of money, often involve the exercise of medical judgment, and in addition, the reimbursible reasonable charge for a particular service may vary from locality to locality, and in fact, it was precisely for this reason that Congress chose to rely on the expertise of the carriers who service the particular areas to determine the reasonable charge rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.210" offset="4081580">But it is not necessary here to rely only on the nature of the Part B program and Respondent's concession that there is nothing specific in the Medicare Act consenting to suit, for in this case the text and the legislative history of Part B demonstrate convincingly that Congress intended to foreclose review of the determination of the amount of benefits due in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.093" offset="4177084">Indeed, it is difficult to conceive how Congress could have expressed its intent any more clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.895" offset="4196310">First, the text of the Medicare Act makes clear that Congress did not intend to expose the United States to suit in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.852" offset="4240196">Of particular significance, we submit, is Section 1395(ff) of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.189" offset="4265482">This is the provision in the Medicare title of the Social Security Act that deals with the circumstances under which an individual beneficiary is entitled to judicial review of matters under the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.166" offset="4317414">Section 1395(ff) provides for judicial review under Part A, the hospital program, both with respect to the individual's entitlement to participate in the program at all, in other words, his initial enrollment, and in addition, in certain circumstances with respect to individual claims for reimbursement for hospital services, although the Act provides for judicial review only where the amount in controversy is $1,000 or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.499" offset="4430785">Under Part B of the Medicare program, however, 1395(ff) provides for judicial review at the behest of the beneficiary only with respect to his initial enrollment in the Part B program, whether he is entitled to enroll, and whether there is any factual question about whether he has enrolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.247" offset="4513750">1395(ff) does not contain a provision for judicial review of benefit determinations, and we regard this as quite significant, because that is the only section that deals with a beneficiary's right to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.070" offset="4565055">Therefore, the clear import of Congress's provision of judicial review in one circumstance, one-half of the program and not the other, would appear to be that Congress didn't intend for judicial review under Part B.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.577" offset="4703086">--Yes, if this were a standard APA type judicial review of agency action, that would be so, but there is another feature of the Medicare Act which runs up against that presumption, and that is Section 405(h), but while this case specifically concerns the court of claims' Tucker Act jurisdiction, we submit that the provisions that Congress has... or Congress's failure to provide some other method of judicial review is equally relevant, because again the standard provision for judicial review of determinations under the Social Security Act, whether it is under the old age and survivor portion or under Part B of Medicare, or SSI, is through Section 405(g) of the Social Security Act, standard review in the district court, and an action filed within 60 days after the individual determination by the Secretary that is being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.778" offset="4911856">Now, there is no reason to think that... and incidentally, I should add that the court of claims has held that it is without jurisdiction over individual social security claims in cases that we have cited in our brief, because Congress has established this separate statutory--</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.803" offset="5063993">That's correct, but Congress has separately addressed that problem by barring review there, but the court of claims has inappropriately applied the presumption in favor of judicial review to the... to the court of claims in which the... the opposite principles apply that a right of action does not exist unless Congress has affirmatively granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.430" offset="5130449">Now, it does, going back for a moment to the fact that Congress has provided for judicial review in other circumstances under the Social Security Act in Section 405(g), there is no reason to think that Congress would have somehow thought that that particular form of review is inappropriate for Part B Medicare claims, and decided that somehow the court of claims would be a better forum for those particular disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.099" offset="5241104">In fact, one would assume that exactly the contrary would be true, because these are relatively small claims for which Congress would more reasonably have wanted to have review in the district courts, not concentrated in the court of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.090" offset="5293140">Now, Respondent has suggested that the failure of Congress to provide for judicial review in 1395(ff), which contains the judicial review provisions of the Medicare Act, is not significant because individual reimbursement disputes are handled under another section of the Medicare Act, 1395(u), which is the section dealing with the carriers' obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.872" offset="5388225">The difficulty with that argument is that Congress didn't provide for judicial review of a carrier's decision under that section, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.776" offset="5411840">So, in the only two sections that Respondent has identified as being relevant, there is an absence of any provision for judicial review, and we think that this is particularly significant again in light of Section 405(h) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.288" offset="5477878">The second sentence of Section 405(h) provides that no findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any tribunal except as specifically provided in the Act, and as incorporated in the Medicare Act, that would mean except as specifically provided in the Medicare Act, and as I have mentioned, there is no such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.118" offset="5557185">Now, as Justice Stevens asked, it is our position that the carrier for these purposes and for purposes of Section 405(h) and the manifest Congressional purpose underlying it, that the preclusion of judicial review by any other tribunal, and that would include the court of claims, would apply equally to Part B claims as it would apply to Part A claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.500" offset="5658749">If there were any doubt lingering after examination of the text of the Medicare Act regarding Congress's intent to foreclose judicial review, we think that would be dispelled by an examination of the legislative history of both the original 1965 Act and the 1972 amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.330" offset="5742028">We have set forth that legislative history at Pages 27 through 30 of our opening brief, and at Pages 7 through 9 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.053" offset="5781002">Of particular significance is the passage in the Senate report which outlines the different means of review of determinations under Part A and Part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.894" offset="5820291">The Senate report points out that there is a right to a hearing by the Secretary and judicial review under Part A where there is at least $1,000 in controversy, but under Part B, the Senate report points out that the carriers would review beneficiary complaints regarding the amount of benefits, and</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.021" offset="5892807">"the bill does not provide for judicial review of a determination concerning the amount of benefits under Part B where claims will probably be for substantially smaller amounts than under Part A.. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.013" offset="5940767">Congress had made a legislative judgment that in the generality of cases, the sorts of claims that would arise under Part B were relatively trivial amounts, that it was inappropriate to burden the courts with reviewing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.503" offset="5994789">But Congress just didn't do this in 1965, it revisited the statute in 1972 and revisited the judicial review provisions because some lower courts... court decisions had carved out what appeared to be an unintended loophole allowing beneficiaries under Part A and Part B to obtain judicial review of essentially coverage questions as to whether a particular service was covered by the statute, without regard to the amount of controversy under Part A, and without regard to the absence of any judicial review generally under Part B, and this was... the introduction and passage of this is discussed on Page 30 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.201" offset="6177541">Senator Bennett, who introduced the revisions to 1395(ff), pointed out that it was the intention of the... of Congress in 1965 to keep these relatively small claims out of court when it enacted the 1965 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.211" offset="6237623">The conference reported adopted Senator Bennett's language, and the conference report states, the Senate amendment added a new section to the House bill which would make clear</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.019" offset="6284852">"that there is no authorization for an appeal to the Secretary or for judicial review on matters solely involving amounts of benefits under Part B.. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.706" offset="6623608">Those points of agreement, I think, add up to acknowledging Erika's central proposition to this Court today, which is that under these circumstances where, as was earlier conceded, a unique or sui generis system has been evolved to deal with 27 million covered beneficiaries in a voluntary program, where $11 a month, going to $12.20 soon, I understand, is paid in premiums, is delegated fully and finally with no judicial recourse anywhere to a private insurance carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.281" offset="6785881">And it is our proposition today that due process, meaning some review by some court, is fundamental in this circumstance, and given the particular context in which Erika's claim a rose, namely, a claim by assignment in this case in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for Part B benefit claims, money, that the appropriate forum to review at least the constitutional and statutory aspects of that claim is the United States Court of Claims under the Tucker Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.578" offset="7083050">The starting point in that analysis has to be the inquiry as to whether the intent has bean expressed to wholly deny judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.084" offset="7113038">In this case, we are in... we are in, in my judgment, at least, a stronger position in insisting that due process requires judicial review, because you don't even have an agency of the government which has been presumed at more fairly, at least in many cases, making the review through an ALJ, where you have a private insurance carrier with a built-in bias interest that was pointed out in McClure making a total and final determination if the government is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.851" offset="7228186">But the specific answer to your question is, you would have to look at whether Congress had clearly and unequivocally intended to deny any right of review from the administrative decision in the government, and then see on the balancing test under Mathews and Eldridge whether in this Court's judgment that was still an appropriate action for Congress to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.783" offset="7315853">The only instance that I have been able to locate in the cases that the government cited where there hasn't been a specific provision for such a review would be in the veterans' benefit cases, for example, Johnson and Robinson, although that case didn't go off on at such, which seems to have been the review issue recognized by Congress as a special area, because they view pensions as a special area, and there is legislative history in that area which you cited in Johnson and Robison where Senator George in 1940 says, in substance, we just have always seen pensions as different, and you don't get judicial review because we want a uniform system, which today would be treated again, I think, by this Court on a Mathews and Eldridge balancing test, but the fact is--</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen H. Oleskey</label>
            <text syncTime="2032.528" offset="8206838">Well, I would say principally, Mr. Justice Stevens, because the beneficiary here, rather than simply having benefitted as someone whose wages were taken involuntarily over the course of his working life under the social security system, has voluntary agreed with the government to make an extra payment monthly, which as I say is now $11, in order to have the benefit of Part B coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.643" offset="8299311">He has stepped forward and agreed to enter into an undertaking that is different in kind and amount that anybody enters into in any other benefit program, including social security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.601" offset="8343197">In return for that, he is entitled to the assurance that the claims will be paid in accordance with the statute and the regulation, and ultimately that comes down to whether or not either the beneficiary or the carrier in this... the provider who was supplied by assignment is going to be paid in accordance with this reasonable charge language in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.216" offset="8437656">One of the problems here, as the court of claims saw, was that the statute on its face was not being honored by the carrier in the fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.339" offset="8478093">The constitutional claim that we raise which was a denial of just compensation under the due process clause, was denied, but the court of claims, as its decision makes clear, found fundamentally that the statute on its face as applied by the carrier had not been honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.736" offset="8555729">There was for Erika here as for other... as for other suppliers in other instances no other place to go in this circumstance, if the government is right that the court of claims is foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.293" offset="8601913">Although the government in its brief has attempted to mitigate or downplay the implications of its position, it has-argued consistently, to my knowledge, since at least 1976 in every circuit and in the court of claims that Congress intended that there being no review of any type of benefits denial under Part B, no matter how egregious the denial... the action by the carrier, including the affirmation in the fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.913" offset="8728451">The answer to the question that was posed earlier, I think, which was that the Secretary himself could be expected to be the final authority who would ensure that at in effect due process was done is illusory, and not really accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.041" offset="8796891">There is no more reason to believe that the Secretary is going to deal ultimately in a due process sense fully and fairly with law questions under the statute and certainly under the Constitution, the latter being beyond his authority anyway, than the... than the hearing officer will, and that is the vice of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.688" offset="8875468">The McClure Joint Appendix makes it clear that the hearing officer, and we would say the ALJ if Judge Orrick's decision was going to be sustained, are in exactly the same position, and that Joint Appendix, at 21 and 51 respectively, points out that the authority of the hearing officer is limited to the extent that he must comply with all provisions of Title 18 of the Act, all regulations, all HCFA rulings, general instructions and other guides issued by HCFA or the Medicare Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.657" offset="9003363">The hearing officer does not have the prerogative of overruling the provisions of the law or interpreting them in a way different than that of the Medicare Bureau when he is in disagreement with their intent, nor may he use hearing decisions as a vehicle for commenting upon the legality, constitutionality, or otherwise of the provisions of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.452" offset="9074521">It goes on to say that his authority is definitively restricted by these parameters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.255" offset="9093747">So, if the Secretary, as my brother has argued, is overlapping and fully to be seen, which in fact he is not, since you don't get a review to the Secretary under the government's position at all, nor do you get an appeal to the Secretary, but to the extent they find the Secretary in his functions overlapping with the hearing officer, the manual itself, which is before you in the Joint Appendix, makes it clear that in effect whatever the interpretation is that HCFA, the child of HHS, puts on the statute or the regulations is going to be binding both on the hearing officer and on the Secretary in this supposed watchdog function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.063" offset="9252989">In effect the question, I think, becomes the old one of who is watching the watchdog where there is no judicial recourse, when the watchdog is supposed to be watching the carrier, with all the interest that you heard earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.702" offset="9299592">Well, the government's answer, fairly put, here is, no one is watching their watchdog, the Secretary of HHS, and that is the vice, if they mean their concession today, which I am sure they do, namely, that due process requires some opportunity for a review by a fair tribunal when property is about to be taken, and the government has conceded here and in other cases before this at lower levels that this interest under Part B benefits is a property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.640" offset="9419337">To address the second aspect of where we find the waiver of sovereign immunity besides the contractual relationship which we say Erika enjoys both as a third party beneficiary and in its own right, that is in a reading of the Medicare statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.285" offset="9493838">Now, in Testan, this Court said, and in other cases which the government and we have cited, that sovereign immunity waiver can be found in the Tucker Act by reference to a substantive right, either a contract right, which I argue is present here in several respects, or in a statute fairly read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.900" offset="9588297">The government continues to confuse in my view the notion that you have to look to that outside statute with its substantive rights in effect to fill the Tucker Act jurisdictional vessel, as if that statute itself need state explicitly, yes, you may sue the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.695" offset="9659559">I don't think that is what Testan or any of the other decisions of this Court in fact stand for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.349" offset="9682129">They stand for the proposition, as you said there, that you have to find the substantive right to money damages or compensation in the other statute, not the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.722" offset="9723611">Indeed, were it otherwise, the Tucker Act, which is a general grant to sue the government under various circumstances, as the Court is aware, wouldn't have any meaning, because you would have to go ahead on every statute and say, as the Congress, and, by the way, the Tucker Act may be invoked if things go awry under this statute and you have a money claim against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.866" offset="9800202">The fact is that the Congress has known when it wanted to very clearly how to limit Tucker Act jurisdiction when it would otherwise be found by reference to some other statute conferring a substantive right, either by contract, as here, or by virtue of the statute itself, as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.995" offset="9868748">For example, I believe it is 28 United States Code 1500 to 1502, provide three very explicit limitations on the jurisdiction of the court of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.202" offset="9913574">Those are that you can't sue in the court of claims where you have brought a suit in some other court in substance on the same ground; you can't sue for pension rights... that same theme that seems to be a special area of the Congress... and you can't sue for rights arising under treaties with foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.312" offset="9978044">So that Congress has known very clearly when it wanted to limit Tucker Act jurisdiction, which the court of claims has been asserting here broadly since 1976 how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.768" offset="10015869">In addition, there are Acts like--</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.870" offset="10024229">Well, Testan and Hopkins, and cases like that, where we have held the court of claims overreached itself under the Tucker Act, certainly weren't barred by those three examples that you gave of limitations on court of claims jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.529" offset="10078877">--That's correct, but in Testan, for example, when you examine the two statutes which the Petitioners had pointed to for the substantive rights, there being no contract claim, unlike this case, you found that neither the Back Pay Act nor the Classification Act conferred a substantive right for money damages for the misclassification that had gone on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.341" offset="10158080">By contrast, here, under the Medicare statute, we are looking at a statutory scheme, an insurance policy, as I think you yourself described this, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in Salfi, which provides for payments in accordance with a policy term, which are the statute and the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.382" offset="10310322">In addition, to follow up on the concern, in cases like the veterans' statutes, in Robison, specifically, when you were discussing what Congress had done there, you pointed properly to explicit statutory bars, not silence, which the government insists on reading as a concession here, but explicit statutory bar which say, the decision of the administrator shall be final, it shall not be reviewed in any tribunal anywhere under any circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.338" offset="10546051">As the government has argued here today, however, the decisions in fact are fairly few in number that are not resolved in some respect or other to the claimant or assignee's benefit ultimately by the time the fair hearing is over.</text>

            <text syncTime="3748.361" offset="15070145">The court of claims rejected Respondent's constitutional objections to the method of reimbursement in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.199" offset="15097522">Respondent has not sought review of that decision, and it is simply not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.003" offset="15116748">All that is involved is Respondent's objection to the manner in which the carrier calculated the claims as a matter of administrative procedure, and this Court has never suggested that that would be unconstitutional, and in fact the veterans' program, for example, that involved in Johnson v. Robison, there is no... it is quite plain, and it was an assumption of this Court's decision in Johnson v. Robison that the ordinary benefits claim under the Veterans Act is not subject to judicial review, and that is all that... that is the only issue that is involved in this case.</text>
