            <label>Mr. John C. Zimmermann</label>
            <text syncTime="59.622" offset="364537">May it please the Court, the State of Tennessee seeks review in this case of a judgment of the Court of Appeals from the Sixth Circuit affirming the judgment of the lower court which granted a writ of habeas corpus to Noah Lundy, ordering that he be released from his sentence unless he was retried within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.618" offset="448547">Following his direct appeal in which his convictions for rape and crime against nature were affirmed, Mr. Lundy sought state petition for post-conviction relief, and it was denied in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.843" offset="501418">No appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.045" offset="506225">Then, later, he petitioned for Federal habeas corpus review of four constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.949" offset="537885">The first two claims had been presented to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.435" offset="555753">The second two claims had never been presented to any state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.756" offset="577069">In our answer, the State of Tennessee objected to the review of the petition in the District Court on the ground that Mr. Lundy had not exhausted all his claims in available state remedies, he had not presented all his claims to the state courts, and therefore, the court, in accordance with the exhaustion requirement, should dismiss his habeas petition until such time as the state conviction and all the Federal constitutional claims which Mr. Lundy sought to raise were adjudicated finally and completely in the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.416" offset="743730">Mr. Zimmermann, what do you make of the paragraph in Judge Morton's opinion in the Joint Appendix on Page 88, where he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="165.205" offset="786884">"Since Grounds 3 and 4 have not been presented to the state court, there has been no exhaustion of remedies as to those two. "</text>
            <text syncTime="173.544" offset="820217">"Thus this court will not consider them in the constitutional framework. "</text>
            <text syncTime="177.830" offset="837353">"However, in assessing the atmosphere of the cause taken as a whole, these items may be referred to collaterally? "</text>

            <label>Mr. John C. Zimmermann</label>
            <text syncTime="184.935" offset="865774">Your Honor, his statement there, I think, presents to this Court and illustrates to this Court how it is difficult for a Federal court to separate the exhaustive and unexhaustive claims from habeas review, which frustrates the exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.913" offset="941738">In this case, Your Honor, he correctly noted, in accordance with our contention, that Claims 3 and 4 had never been presented to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.669" offset="976742">And here he said that he would not consider them in the constitutional framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.757" offset="997118">However, he later says in his opinion that the four claims were... constituted such a mixture of constitutional violations that they could not be separated one from another.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.730" offset="1048945">He relied not only upon Claim Number 4, which was the instruction issue, but also the statement of the prosecutor set forth in Claim Number 3, which had never been presented to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.688" offset="1096801">He used those to illustrate how Mr. Lundy had been denied his right to due process of law, together with the first two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.830" offset="1133373">Not only did he do that, but he saw numerous others, a litany, actually, of statements by the prosecuting attorney that had never been presented in the petition, many of which had never been presented to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.255" offset="1199097">He took this litany of remarks by the state prosecutor and said, look at all these remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.159" offset="1226682">I find possible misconduct, and I find because of all this, because of all these remarks, he is entitled to habeas relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.813" offset="1261268">What we are asking this Court to do is to require that in cases like this, that a state prisoner proceed first all through the state courts, take all his Federal constitutional claims before he goes to the Federal courts, because, you see, in this case many of the constitutional claims, or many of the remarks which Judge Morton, the District Judge, found to be constitutionally defective, we submit, have been waived under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.534" offset="1384148">No objection had been made as required by state evidentiary rules, procedural rules, and therefore, if the whole case and all the constitutional claims had been given to the state courts, our courts could have conducted whatever evidentiary hearings were necessary, they could have made--</text>

            <text syncTime="341.518" offset="1492086">The problem here is, the claims of prosecutorial misconduct... it was a different claim in the Federal court from what it was in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.539" offset="1528240">The identity of the claim, if you please, of prosecutorial misconduct was twofold in the state courts: Number One, whether or not this remark of Mr. Lundy's violent character was constitutionally defective, and Number Two, in the state court, Mr. Lundy alleged, that the prosecutors had made disparaging remarks about his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.120" offset="1618519">Now, those were the only two acts of prosecutorial misconduct presented to the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.033" offset="1702215">Well, it is a due process claim, essentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.235" offset="1714963">It could be other claims, such as a Fifth Amendment violation, where a prosecutor comments upon a defendant's failure to take the stand, or it could trigger other constitutional rights, but under Donnelly it is a due process analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.607" offset="1848501">I think the teaching under Picard v. Connor is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.741" offset="1861040">Give the state courts fair notice of what your constitutional complaint is, your Federal constitutional complaint is.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.597" offset="1896462">Tell them what your complaint is.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.632" offset="1904612">And that claim itself can be brought over to the Federal Courts, because then you have identified a specific constitutional violation, not requiring, of course, to cite book, chapter, and verse, but you have given the courts, state courts fair notice of what your complaint is.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.642" offset="1968560">Now, the lower Federal courts, for example, have found such claims as ineffective assistance of counsel to constitute different identity of claims, such as, there might be a conflict of interest in effective assistance of counsel, where a lawyer represented two defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.209" offset="2078901">Say one was a Fifth Amendment claim, another a Sixth Amendment claim; one a compulsory incrimination claim and another a denial of jury trial or something, or denial of counsel, wholly independent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.191" offset="11638777">I am aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.991" offset="11645987">Your Honor, I think that Rule 9(B) and the Code Section 2244 give the District Courts ammunition to deal with something like that, and I don't feel that because some people have abused the writ, that we should take the man who has a meritorious claim and say, you've only got one shot at this, and you are going to sit in jail until you put everything through the state Courts, all these possible claims, before you can come to the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.947" offset="11785794">I feel that is denying him access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.649" offset="11796661">As to the restriction of cross examination of the complainant witness, that one error in itself I feel would call for granting of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.347" offset="11883387">Everything else set aside, the right of cross examination is so vital, especially in a case like this, to the guarantee of a free trial, that the denial of that restriction is prejudicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.755" offset="11941066">This Court has found so in the Alford case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.707" offset="11952873">There is reference made in the Petitioner's brief to a jury-out hearing.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. D. Shannon Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2965.244" offset="11987041">That claim was exhausted, and it was so admitted in the state's answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.765" offset="12005118">There was reference to a jury-out hearing where some of these questions were posed to the complainant witness, but a jury... or a hearing... a cross examination outside the trier of the fact is of absolutely no value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.655" offset="12056631">The jury has a right to see that witness when she is asked that question and when she answers that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.678" offset="12088710">Can she look them in the eye?</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.911" offset="12093725">Does she hesitate?</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.213" offset="12098845">Does she... they have a right to observe her demeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.748" offset="12113056">And that issue alone, I think, calls for the granting of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.633" offset="12132595">In closing, the writ of habeas corpus is designed to give relief to those unjustly imprisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.072" offset="12170316">It is a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.674" offset="12176690">I stated before, that most of these petitioners file these pro se, and most petitioners are uneducated, at least in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.761" offset="12201036">The exhaustion rule as treated by the court is a law of timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.267" offset="12231129">It is not a rule of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.633" offset="12236563">It is not and neither is it meant to he an obstacle to be put in the path of a prisoner who is imprisoned unjustly, and merely to say that because there are those who file frivolous claims, we must deal more harshly with those who have meritorious claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.681" offset="12316811">I don't feel that is the correct way to interpret the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.799" offset="12333216">There are two courts now that have found merit in Lundy's petition.</text>
