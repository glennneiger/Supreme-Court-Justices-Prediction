            <text syncTime="15.120" offset="137841">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.025" offset="149544">This case is here on a writ of certiorari at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, three questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.132" offset="173890">First, the United States violates a criminal defendant's Fifth Amendment due process or Sixth Amendment compulsory process rights when it deports an illegal alien after making a reasonable investigation in concluding that the illegal alien has no material exculpatory evidence to make available to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.468" offset="247242">Second, assuming that the Government acts at its peril in deporting illegal aliens while the defendant in order to state a constitutional violation still must demonstrate that the laws of the illegal alien has caused him a concrete loss of material exculpatory evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.718" offset="316310">Finally, assuming that the Court of Appeals is correct, that the -- that the respondent's constitutional rights are violated when the defendant is deprived of no more than the loss of a conceivable benefit or the proper remedy for that technical constitutional violation is dismissal of the indictment against the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.044" offset="389557">On March 29th, 1980, respondent was captured in the process of transporting five illegal aliens from Escondido, California to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.169" offset="426024">The circumstances surrounding respondent's arrest were explained by respondent in his own post arrest statement volunteered to Border Patrol agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.511" offset="459461">Respondent is an illegal alien from Mexico, he entered the -- he entered this country approximately six days prior to his arrest with the assistance of an illegal alien smuggler.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.189" offset="498122">He had been kept in a house in Escondido prior up to the day of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.460" offset="523199">On the day he was arrested, he agreed with the illegal alien smuggler to transport five additional illegal aliens to Los Angeles in return for the price of his illegal entry into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.271" offset="578475">Respondent had been told that the Border Patrol agents at the Temecula checkpoint were not actually checking for illegal aliens; unfortunately, for respondent, he was misinformed and was pulled over to the side or at least was motioned over to the side.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.412" offset="631033">He slowed the car down and then drove away at a very high rate of speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.612" offset="643885">Border Patrol agents chased him, two agents in a single car and respondent stopped his car approximately a mile away from the checkpoint and fled on foot along with the other five illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.825" offset="700728">Respondent and three illegal aliens were captured by the Border Patrol agents; two other illegal aliens, however, escaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.227" offset="738344">The Border Patrol agents then returned the respondent back to the Border Patrol checkpoint, informed the respondent of his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.850" offset="764780">He, however, waives the right and agreed to make a statement under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.048" offset="781603">In the recorded statement, he explained his decision to flee from the Border Patrol checkpoint on the basis, “I already knew that I had had it, too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.841" offset="816711">It was done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="185.811" offset="820682">Later, he told the agents, “I acknowledge the charge of driving.”</text>
            <text syncTime="189.951" offset="837191">The agents also interviewed the other illegal aliens and they all admitted that they were in the county illegally and the respondent had been the driver of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.743" offset="868329">The Border Patrol agent at that point or soon thereafter called the Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of California for advice as to how to proceed in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.902" offset="905005">The Assistant U.S. Attorney based on the information regarding the respondent's apparent confession, the accumulative nature of -- of the statements made by the three additional illegal aliens and the general circumstances surrounding the arrest, the flight, et cetera, decided that no useful purpose would be served either for the Government or for the defendant in requiring two otherwise none -- not prosecutable by our -- in our discretion, however, but not prosecutable illegal aliens to remain in custody and therefore authorized the release of those two illegal aliens back in Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.474" offset="6755284">First is the issue of what the statute with which Mr. Valenzuela was charged required for proof of conviction and what the defense in the case was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.016" offset="6797498">Secondly, the way in which the Government's action in this case violated the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.937" offset="6825188">Third, what the actual procedure is in the Southern District of California in implementing the Ninth Circuit decision in Mendez-Rodriguez, a decision that has been adapted by the Circuits -- of the three other Circuits, the Fifth, the Seventh, and recently in Armijo-Martinez, the Sixth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.919" offset="6945038">And in that case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that deportation of the witnesses before an interview is a violation of due process, the sanction for which is dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.538" offset="6987565">However, they said we reject the automatic dismissal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.083" offset="7005746">The Ninth Circuit of course does not have an automatic dismissal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.317" offset="7022674">And in a subsequent case (Inaudible), the Fifth Circuit said that the standard is that the defense in order to obtain relief must show either a plausible theory or some slight suggestion concerning which the witnesses could have helped.</text>
