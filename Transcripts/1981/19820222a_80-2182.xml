            <label>Mr. Milton A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="98.747" offset="549084">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="102.716" offset="564967">In this dispute between generic manufacturing companies and brand name companies, the generic manufacturers are seeking to get a larger share of the drug industry, of the drug market.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.910" offset="637692">The brand name companies are seeking to retain or increase their dominant position in the prescription drug market.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.616" offset="672487">It has been variously reported that they have approximately 90 percent of the prescription drug market at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.657" offset="712715">What the brand name companies are asking, what they're asking for the Court to give them is a monopoly on color.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.131" offset="758586">They're asking this for a competitive advantage, and that's why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="779902">Both sides in this dispute claim they speak in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.856" offset="805502">We believe that our position weighs more heavily in the public interest than that of the brand name companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.712" offset="844895">If the brand name companies are given a monopoly on color, I respectfully submit they will be able to use that advantage for unfair competition whether or not it is found by this Court that there is functionality present.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.362" offset="947504">The question of whether there is functionality will depend upon the definition that this Court lays down.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.635" offset="980627">But irrespective of whether there is a fact of functionality, even then I believe it will be used to the great advantage of the brand name companies and to the disadvantage of the generic companies for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.478" offset="1043948">The Respondent and the PMA, the association that represents the brand name companies, have submitted briefs to this Court, and they have said to this Court color serves no function other than to deceive the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.606" offset="1112493">They have said that to this Court in order to get the color monopoly they seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.510" offset="1140079">But when they speak outside of this Court, they do not say color has no purpose or no function.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.234" offset="1183024">On the contrary, we have found that one company, for example, issued a document to its salesmen for discussion with physicians to convince them that they should prescribe the brand name product and not the generic product.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.945" offset="1257839">And they said... they didn't say what they told the courts, color has no function; they said color has advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.218" offset="1294933">If you change, some patients may become concerned that it's been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.705" offset="1316875">They said particularly in the hospitals, if you change the color, if you don't keep prescribing the brand name product, you'll have problems with all personnel handling the medications.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.632" offset="1372569">Explanations alone will be time consuming.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.333" offset="1387406">They'll require additional checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.952" offset="1397855">Possible confusion and additional effort will result.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.237" offset="1414991">Now, that's--</text>

            <label>Mr. Milton A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="331.911" offset="1481656">Correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="333.029" stopTime="337.998">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="333.029" offset="1486149">We're not concerned properly, are we, with the 43a question, would you agree?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="milton_a_bass" startTime="337.998" stopTime="433.043">
            <label>Mr. Milton A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="337.998" offset="1506002">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.183" offset="1510809">The case comes up on an alleged violation of Section 32, and more precisely, whether the defendant manufacturers are guilty of contributory liability or contributory violative conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.407" offset="1559710">But I would respectfully submit, Your Honor, the question of functionality is essential, in my view, to a consideration of this problem because when these cases have been presented in the district courts, in the lower courts, that is the argument that has been presented to the court time and time again: color has no purpose except to deceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.642" offset="1668588">And I believe that is the reason we're here today; that the lower courts have accepted that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.396" offset="1695651">And therefore, with due respect, I merely wish to point out that no matter what Your Honor decides is the definition of functionality, well, I believe this itself is functionality, that our ability to effectively compete... I'm not saying we cannot compete... to effectively compete will be damaged if they can say to the doctor do not prescribe the generic because you'll cause confusion, mistake, error, patient resistance, whether that's true or not, even though we will submit, as I will discuss now, it is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.921" offset="1845698">So that the strict legal question, Your Honor, you are correct, is are we guilty of contributory violative conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.325" offset="1879344">But I--</text>

            <text syncTime="441.815" offset="1921349">I believe that must be done, and I can do it now, or I intended to address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.584" offset="1936395">The reason I wanted to--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="447.969" stopTime="458.677">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="447.969" offset="1945904">It just seemed to me that maybe a lot of time was spent in the briefs arguing something that we wouldn't end up resolving if we stuck to the question that we were supposed to resolve.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="milton_a_bass" startTime="458.677" stopTime="847.322">
            <label>Mr. Milton A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="458.677" offset="1988745">--Well, that is true, Your Honor, but there is one other factor that is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.729" offset="2004941">Inherent in applying the standard that the Second Circuit discussed both in Ives II and Ives IV, both the first decision written by Judge Friendly and the second by Judge Mansfield, one of the rules laid down is that you will find contributory liability if you suggest even by implication that you should commit illegal substitution or mislabeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.462" offset="2119880">The second part that Judge Friendly mentioned was if you continue to sell to someone you know is illegally committing these acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.734" offset="2156973">In discussing the question of whether you come within the first prong of that rule, if that is the rule this Court should adopt, that if you suggest even by implication, whether or not there is functionality becomes relevant, separate and apart even from the question of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.398" offset="2243700">But even liability itself will hinge on whether there is a complete absence of functionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.218" offset="2270972">And the reason why the Respondent and the other briefers make great moment of that question is precisely because I believe they cannot sustain any position unless they can convince this Court that color serves no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.132" offset="2346622">If color serves a purpose, they have then lost their basic position to get a color monopoly, because that is what they are saying to the Court constituted the suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.190" offset="2394792">Now, I will, Your Honor, be happy to address it right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.975" offset="2409943">When Judge Friendly in Ives II said the standards we're using are twofold... either you suggest even by implication that you should commit the wrongful act, or you continue selling... he said also he was adopting Judge Wyzanski's discussion and rule in the Coca-Cola-Snow Crest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.590" offset="2500431">When it came to the Ives IV decision in which the majority opinion was written by Judge Mansfield, he said he was applying that rule, and to come within that rule he said there were a number of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.433" offset="2567827">He said the color, which was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.718" offset="2580889">He said there were catalogs and price lists which compared prices and mentioned the color of both products.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.407" offset="2611713">Significantly, when the Respondent submitted its brief in this case, it did not adopt what Judge Mansfield said, even though he ruled in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.898" offset="2665630">They are trying to contend and argue that color alone, color alone comes within the rule to constitute the suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.456" offset="2703873">And I would respectfully submit, Your Honor, twofold: first, that is not a proper rule to be adopted; and secondly, that this Court of Appeals did not properly apply the rule in terms of showing that there was compliance with the requirement laid down in Ives II, if that is the rule this Court agrees with.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.138" offset="2806586">Because when Ives II came before the Court of Appeals, the court effectively said color is not enough to constitute a suggestion by implication or otherwise that you should commit an illegal act, violate the criminal code because we sell it in the same color, because if that were adequate, the Court would not have sent it back and said a trial will have further evidence to see what each side can introduce to try to come within or negate compliance with that rule of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.096" offset="2958410">And in that regard I would like to point out what is relevant and significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.119" offset="2986518">When Judge Friendly sent the case back for trial, he said you've give us 15 instances of illegal substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.975" offset="3021940">I don't think this is of any moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.260" offset="3035106">This is not extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.460" offset="3039912">Though I might point out we later found out there were really only four; they found four cases of illegal substitution in the United States... one in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one in Tylertown, Mississippi, and two in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.269" offset="3099158">And what did they do when they came back with the additional evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="739.471" offset="3111906">They did not conduct a study, which Judge Friendly asked them to do, to try to show more extensive illegal substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.296" offset="3159240">They showed... there was an indictment against six pharmacists for illegal substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.802" offset="3189228">That was all they showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.235" offset="3194975">But the study they conducted, allegedly to follow the direction of the Court of Appeals, was on legal substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.506" offset="3232069">And, Your Honors, I respectfully ask how can legal substitution be connected with or related to contributory violative conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="784.433" offset="3291837">In other words, if the substitution isn't legal under the law, how can we say the manufacturer is suggesting to the pharmacist that he comply with the law, sell my product, the generic product but put his trademark on it?</text>
            <text syncTime="808.132" offset="3386609">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="810.149" offset="3394655">What motive is there for the manufacturer to tell the pharmacist you have the legal right, the law says you can legally substitute?</text>
            <text syncTime="819.837" offset="3433421">Ives isn't losing a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.039" offset="3442198">It's not its sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.989" offset="3446064">Under the substitution law it's mine, the generic companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.008" offset="3462051">So what they did to try to prove what the Ives II court asked them to do was come in with a survey on legal substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.132" offset="3506564">And I would respectfully submit there was a complete failure of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.620" offset="3524536">But what we are trying to ask this Court today is not--</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.677" offset="6520781">The name Ives to identify source or some distinctive little star I would put in the same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.314" offset="6547321">The color is the overall appearance that the patient sees to identify his medicine, as I see it, Your Honor, and I separate what functions they're playing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.205" offset="6594864">You see, in this industry there's something very unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.026" offset="6610120">We are not looking at products that are sitting on a shelf, and a consumer comes in and chooses a product, and there's a question of deception or palming off when he chooses one product against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.416" offset="6659752">In the prescription drug industry he doesn't even seen it until he goes home after he picked it up at the pharmacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.004" offset="6690054">The doctor prescribes the product and decides what he'll get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.558" offset="6704265">So that the overall appearance and color plays no function in the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.128" offset="6730596">The whole classic or historical purpose is not present here, so there is a basic distinction, Your Honor, in what we are contending here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.651" offset="6768631">In answer to Justice Powell's question of functionality, though, if I might state, although we submit that all of these elements that constitute functionality... questions of patient-doctor communication, the co-mingling problem, the confusion problem, or even what Parke-Davis calls the psychological problem in which they actually issued a paper that color itself answers a positive or negative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.943" offset="6925783">You wouldn't have a certain kind of black pill or a certain kind of other negative pill, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.263" offset="6943129">We think the emergency aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.463" offset="6951906">We think these are functional, but our submission, as stated earlier, even if the rule or definition of functionality does not encompass all of those, the reality of the commercial dispute that competition exists here will still exist, and we know that that is not speculation but actually the fact of what is occurring.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.638" offset="7100595">The United States contends that the Court of Appeals incorrectly found contributory infringement in the trade name Cyclospasmol.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.731" offset="7152944">This case presents important questions as to federal competition policy, on the one hand between the policy favoring product imitation, which will ultimately hopefully allow for reduced prices to consumers; and on the other hand, the federal policy favoring competition by product differentiation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.459" offset="7227863">Do you think the Lanham Act is the federal policy favoring competition by differentiation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerrold J. Ganzfried</label>
            <text syncTime="1773.347" offset="7247403">It states so in the legislative history, in the Senate report that we cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.501" offset="7272062">It is certainly one aspect of the federal policy favoring competition by product differentiation, so long as there is a distinctive trademark or so long as the company that is seeking the protection has established that the symbol it seeks to protect has acquired in the minds of consumers an identification with the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.830" offset="7357431">Now, in this case the only trademark that's involved is the name Cyclospasmol, and any claim of infringement under Section 32 must be rooted in the misuse of that particular word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.774" offset="7421169">Keeping this as a central fact in the case in mind, we approach the issues presented under the legal standard described by Judge Friendly in the first appeal in this case and nominally applied by the majority in the second appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.849" offset="7473414">Now, that standard that Judge Friendly announced has been referred to by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.901" offset="7489715">We contend that the problem with the majority's opinion on the second appeal is that in effect it read the intent element out of the standard and found liability on a lesser showing that Petitioners merely facilitated infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.895" offset="7549692">In addition, there was error in the Court of Appeals' conclusion... Justice O'Connor's question earlier as to the standard of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.299" offset="7575292">They did not find that any of the findings of the District Court were clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.036" offset="7590234">Rather, the words they used were "unconvincing" and "unpersuasive".</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.655" offset="7604653">That, we submit, is not an appropriate standard for reversing findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.808" offset="7625342">Now, as to the question of what the Court of Appeals did find on the second appeal, there was indeed evidence of trademark infringement by a small number of retail druggists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.699" offset="7676856">However, the record is absent any proof that the Petitioners in fact suggested or implied this course of conduct to the druggists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.174" offset="7722727">To the contrary, the record does support, and the District Court found, that the generic manufacturers label their bottles only with the generic name cyclandelate, never with the trade name Cyclospasmol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.065" offset="7770270">And each bottle manufactured by the manufacturing Petitioners clearly states the name of the appropriate manufacturer; thus, there was no direct infringement by the manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.455" offset="7819902">There was, however, direct infringement when those few retailers mislabeled the generic name as the brand name and failed to inform customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.228" offset="7855011">But the Petitioners could be vicariously liable for these isolated acts of druggists as contributory infringers only if they have the knowledge or intent required by Judge Friendly and the cases recited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.321" offset="7911331">And as I previously indicated, Ives has no evidence on that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.391" offset="7939648">It merely showed facilitation and relied on the assumption that when presented with identical capsules, pharmacists as a group will be so tempted that they will disregard their professional obligations and statutory responsibilities simply in order to make a fast buck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.019" offset="8006103">Now, this is a pessimistic assumption that's similar to one that the Court was asked to make in Virginia Board of Pharmacy, and the Court properly refused to do so, because in any event this temptation to deceive, which is presented when any product is imitated, whether it be a Singer sewing machine, or Shredded Wheat, or cocoa quinine, or Hungarian bitter water... whenever a product is copied, there is some temptation presented to those further down the line in distribution to pass it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.841" offset="8145388">But this has never been held to be a sufficient nexus between the manufacturer, who makes no suggestion, merely facilitates, and the ultimate infringement by the retail person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.833" offset="8205365">In fact, the language of the Court of Appeals in the Coca-Cola-Snow Crest case... I realize that Judge Wyzanski's opinion tends to get a lot of comment, but there is some language in the Court of Appeals decision in that case which bears on this very issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.247" offset="8279031">And that is that the court said that all that Snow Crest did to make substitution possible was to make their product identical, which it had a right to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.894" offset="11249675">Color change comes about fairly frequently in this industry because there are many companies that sell generics that do not duplicate the appearance of the pioneer or market leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.268" offset="11291158">And while the patients may inquire and may say I notice why is this green this month, it's always been red, hasn't it, the testimony is when the pharmacist or the physician explains you're getting a generic because it's the same product, we believe it's cheaper, patients accept that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2818.156" offset="11426681">On the other hand, we have significant evidence that color changes all the time, for example, in institutional settings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.428" offset="11459804">Hospitals and government institutions for years have bought generics, and they buy on the basis of the best price, also quality, and their colors change frequently.</text>

            <text syncTime="3959.509" offset="15992049">I believe I was in the middle of an answer to a question from Justice Stevens about the frequency of the infringements, and we have to look at those infringements in a few ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.185" offset="16046802">When we're talking about the legal substitution but followed by mislabeling or passing off, our survey showed that this occurred 29 percent of the time in the pharmacies in New York where the shopping was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.409" offset="16103749">In this particular case, while we have many instances of illegal substitution and mislabeling, that is not projectable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.932" offset="16137813">There was not a projectable survey done on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.467" offset="16147948">So I cannot say what the percentage is, but it's clear from the history of the pharmaceutical industry, from the FTC report that is referred to many times in the briefs, and from other look-alike cases, of which there have been many recently, that there is a substantial amount of illegal substitution and therefore infringement involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.868" offset="16249512">In the FTC report I believe it was said to be as high as 25 percent of the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="4745.312" offset="19135311">Nine of those 10 told the patient you're getting a generic.</text>

            <text syncTime="4783.004" offset="19286090">They asked do you carry a generic after he gave them the prescription and charged them the lower price, and he answered I gave you a generic.</text>

            <text syncTime="4793.328" offset="19327364">Also, Justice O'Connor, your question about the name Ives on the capsule is most appropriate, because not only do my over-50 eyes read that Ives, but they refused to include the Ives pill in those pills she showed the patients when the very company doing the survey recommended they put the Ives there; but we can only surmise why they didn't want to include for those test subjects the word Ives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.847" offset="19453483">Now, Justice Powell, I'd like to correct an answer I gave you because I misunderstood your question earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.103" offset="19482426">You asked me about manufacturers of Cyclospasmol in the same color.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.506" offset="19504056">I thought you were asking me today, and I answered as I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.708" offset="19520879">However, I am told you asked in more general form.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.094" offset="19538433">Prior to the decision in the Second Circuit there were about 22 companies selling Cyclospasmol in the same color.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.600" offset="19572497">One company, this Hauck from Georgia, sold it in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.004" offset="19590051">This is a practice and this record that shows goes back 40 years, the generic companies selling the products in the same color.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.526" offset="19632160">Counsel has referred in answer to your question, Justice Stevens, about Judge Wyzanski's decision in the Court of Appeals decision in Snow Crest and Coca-Cola, and she referred again numerous times this afternoon about the pharmacists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.154" offset="19698720">And I would only humbly suggest it is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.106" offset="19714498">Judge Wyzanski said bartenders are not so unique that they would be deemed to be people who would commit a wrongful act in substituting another cola for Coca-Cola.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.383" offset="19767579">There's nothing in this record that shows that pharmacists should be denominated worse than bartenders and should be considered unique to commit criminal acts to have premised their argument made to this Court today.</text>
