            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="11.499" offset="123509">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.012" offset="141481">The question presented is whether a motion to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens must be denied when dismissal would result in the change in applicable law unfavorable to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.296" offset="210653">The action arises out of a crash of a small airplane in the Scottish highlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.728" offset="240433">The pilot and all five passengers were killed instantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.017" offset="257569">The decedents as well as their heirs and next of kin were all Scottish.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.866" offset="288916">The respondent is an American who is acting as representative of the victims in States.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.518" offset="323502">She filed a damage action in the United States District Court against petitioners, the American Corporation that manufactured the aircraft and its propellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.861" offset="376896">She concedes that she filed a suit in the United States solely because American law was more favorable than Scottish law.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.568" offset="419737">Petitioners moved to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens claiming that the trial should take place in Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.072" offset="453801">The District Court granted their motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.969" offset="465399">It found that the private interest relating to the convenience of the litigants and the public interest relating to the convenience of the Court itself favored trial in Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.611" offset="519943">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.460" offset="531332">That Court noted that the dismissal and trial of the cases in Scotland would lead to a change in applicable law that would be unfavorable to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.109" offset="593922">It ruled that dismissal should be automatically barred in such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.704" offset="616282">The Court of Appeals further held that that dismissal was inappropriate because the District Court had not properly balanced the private and public interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.591" offset="659855">Today, in an opinion filed with the clerk, we hold that the possibility of an unfavorable change in law could not automatically bar dismissal on the grounds of forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.342" offset="710846">Automatic dismissal would be inconsistent with the purposes of a forum non conveniens doctrine and would pose substantial practical problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.488" offset="755463">We also hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the private and public interest favored trial in Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.753" offset="792452">Thus, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.012" offset="801543">Justice Powell took no part in the decision of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.104" offset="817948">Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.218" offset="838323">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.753" offset="860475">And Justice Stevens joined by Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
