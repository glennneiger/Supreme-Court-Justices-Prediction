            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="127480">The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Searle and Company against Cohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.966" offset="163320">Mr. Richmond, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="13.730" offset="182337">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is the constitutionality of a New Jersey statute which places unique discriminatory burdens on corporations which are located entirely outside the state of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.316" offset="256734">On its face, the statute involved here is one that simply states that the New Jersey tolling statute will not run against a corporation... unless... I am sorry... will not run as long as the corporation is not represented in the state of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.886" offset="334997">Our position is that the purpose of the tolling statute has been satisfied by the adoption in New Jersey of long arm jurisdiction and service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.756" offset="378464">The statute also places a heavy penalty upon out of state corporations, and finally, that the purported justifications for the tolling statute are either fictions or are improper, and each of these justifications could be accomplished in less discriminatory fashions.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.264" offset="468535">There is no question, Mr. Richmond, is there, that Searle does business in New Jersey, and is subject to the long arm statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Richmond</label>
            <text syncTime="94.478" offset="505315">There is no dispute in this case, Your Honor, that New Jersey does have long arm jurisdiction over G. D. Searle and Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.398" offset="541051">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.787" offset="542618">There is also no dispute in this case that Searle does not do business within the state for purposes of its qualification statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.332" offset="572711">Tolling statutes exist in many states, but their purpose is to protect a plaintiff against having his cause of action lost as a result of not being able to serve the defendant within the state, but the New Jersey statute has a unique and critical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.995" offset="659438">In New Jersey, the only way a foreign corporation may get the benefit of a statute of limitations is by registering to do business within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.537" offset="705622">This means that New Jersey denies the statute of limitations to all corporations that may be served by long arm jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.502" offset="753478">I take it it is your position that to appoint an agent for service, you must qualify to do business within the state of New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.263" offset="788482">Our position is that there is simply no procedure under New Jersey law by which a corporation could appoint an agent for service of process without more.</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Richmond</label>
            <text syncTime="177.444" offset="837175">--No, but the opposition's position is based upon a footnote in the Velmohos case from the New Jersey Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.833" offset="866745">The court was not considering in that footnote the extent of the qualification which would be necessary in order to appoint an agent for service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.407" offset="909064">All the court was doing was addressing the question of whether a corporation could terminate the running of the statute of limitations by appointing an agent, and the body of the Velmohos case makes it obvious that the court was considering that only two kinds of defendants could be exempted from the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.960" offset="995268">One was the domestic corporation and the other one was the one that was licensed within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.536" offset="1017524">As I say--</text>

            <text syncTime="230.689" offset="1050229">We agree entirely that the New Jersey Supreme Court has the right to interpret its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.704" offset="1070291">However--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="236.404" offset="1073008">What about the court of appeals, though?</text>
            <text syncTime="237.937" offset="1079173">Did the court of appeals have anything to say about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.232" offset="1092339">The Third Circuit?</text>

            <text syncTime="243.214" offset="1100280">--The court of appeals, as a matter of fact, adopted obviously the interpretation of the New Jersey law by the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.224" offset="1156287">However, the New Jersey Supreme Court was not addressing the point that the respondent here is arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.285" offset="1184603">The New Jersey Supreme Court in Velmohos was not stating that in fact the New Jersey statutes permitted a designation of agents for service of process without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.171" offset="1236117">As I say, it was merely that footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.717" offset="1246252">The body of the case makes it obvious that what they were addressing was the question of only two exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.728" offset="1274360">One was for the domestic corporation, and the other was for the corporation license in the state, that is, qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.726" offset="1302363">Now, many companies, like Searle, may not be sued in New Jersey except under long arm jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.535" offset="1333606">All they do in New Jersey is send their products into the state for eventual sale, and they promote the products.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.532" offset="1361504">They don't have offices there, other facilities, and they are not doing business there.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.983" offset="1387313">These companies are subject, however, to product liability suits for... in instances where citizens of New Jersey claim that the products have caused them some harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.963" offset="1431304">Then, long arm jurisdiction is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.571" offset="1445723">As a matter of fact, in this case, long arm jurisdiction was in fact used to serve process on Searle.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.522" offset="1469547">This happened ten years after the event which gives rise to the cause of action here, and four years after the plaintiffs concede that they realize that they had a cause of action, or discovered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.032" offset="1531509">The New Jersey tolling statute therefore has the effect of never foreclosing the plaintiff's case on limitations against corporations which may be sued under long arm jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.867" offset="1606847">Yes, Your Honor, there would perhaps be a Latchees defense, although that is an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.302" offset="1628685">This is a law case.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.052" offset="1635686">But Latchees would certainly be an inadequate substitute for the certainty and predictability of a statute of defense based... a statute of limitations defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.812" offset="1682706">There is simply no comparison between the two defenses on the basis of planning opportunities for the corporation or its ability to have a reliable defense against liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.379" offset="1960962">It is the position of the New Jersey Secretary of State and our position in this case that there is simply no provision in the law which permits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.811" offset="2006624">If you examine the corporation law, it has only provisions which provide for full scale qualification, not simply for designation of an agent for service of process.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.103" offset="3011816">Now, what happens in connection with the commerce clause is that this does indeed constitute a heavy burden on interstate commerce because the defendants are placed in a position of having the added expense and the possibility of adverse judgments when New Jersey defendants would not be subjected to those risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.204" offset="3104290">There is no justification for this discrimination, and every one of the legitimate state interests can be fully accomplished by less discriminatory means.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.604" offset="3153818">The justification for the tolling statute has been basically on the ground that it makes it easier to serve process, or that there are purported difficulties in service of process for New Jersey residents against unrepresented foreign corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.519" offset="3233544">However, when you look at the justifications, we believe that it is clear that they are either fictional or that they are in themselves improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.278" offset="3284535">The first of these is that it said that it is harder to locate perhaps the out of state defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.135" offset="3315986">However, in this case Searle is a Fortune 500 company.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.257" offset="3332496">There was never any question in this case as to whether or not the defendant could be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.507" offset="3353498">Furthermore, the tolling statute really goes too far in that it permits the plaintiff to avoid the statute of limitations indefinitely, even though he does indeed find out the location of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.437" offset="3417132">Decades could pass during which the plaintiff knew the location of the defendant, and yet he would not be subject to the statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.604" offset="3473870">--Yes, sir, to the extent that Latchees can be considered any kind of adequate substitute for the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.961" offset="3499261">The problem of locating a defendant, were one to exist, would also apply to in state and out of state corporations alike, and there wouldn't be any basis for discriminating only against out of state corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.769" offset="3554536">As a matter of fact, a fly by night local corporation may often be much more difficult to locate than a national corporation which is of the size and visibility of a G. D. Searle and Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.355" offset="3620887">Now, there are alternates in the New Jersey law which could be adopted in order to accomplish the legitimate purpose and those include the notion that since New Jersey now has a statute of limitations which applies only when the plaintiff could reasonably be said to have discovered this cause of action, it might be said that the plaintiff would not be subject to limitations until the plaintiff reasonably discovered the location of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.481" offset="3757351">Also under existing law, as a matter of fact, the toll... the statute is tolled by the filing of the lawsuit, and time is given after that within which to file the... to serve the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.476" offset="3817328">As a practical matter, cases are not dismissed in New Jersey when the plaintiff reports that he is trying to find the defendant but has been unable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.504" offset="3861423">Finally, I suppose the state could adopt the statute which tolls only when the defendant cannot be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.342" offset="3892770">A second justification of the three... there are three justifications basically which have been used... is that the statute relieves the plaintiff of his burden under New Jersey rules of satisfying the court that long arm jurisdiction may not... or that long arm service may not be made within a state and of filing an affidavit to that effect, but the alternative obviously is to ease access to the use of long arm jurisdiction and service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.001" offset="4035398">This would lift any burden that the plaintiff has without continuing the discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.763" offset="4070507">For example, the requirement for an affidavit at all could be eliminated, and that would lift some of the burden of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.303" offset="4124633">It could be adopted, a provision could be adopted whereby elimination of proof to the court at all that service of process by long arm jurisdiction isn't possible would be an alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.813" offset="4198716">I think few, if any, states have this affidavit provision, probably because its only purpose is... or the only purpose it really serves is to facilitate harassment of the plaintiff by the defendants in connection with service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.227" offset="4268306">The third and last justification for the tolling statute is that it relieves plaintiff of the burden of satisfying the court that long arm jurisdiction or service is consistent with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.503" offset="4329433">Respondent is apparently saying that New Jersey has some interest in forcing the defendant to waive its right to due process or in simplifying litigation by eliminating the jurisdictional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.135" offset="4403934">This is too heavy a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.320" offset="4420757">The burden can't be justified on the basis that the state is relieving the plaintiff of satisfying minimum contact requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.286" offset="4460567">This Court in Shaffer v. Heitner said that cost is just too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.893" offset="4478958">None of the justifications raised to support the tolling statute based on the alleged difficulty of services justifies the indefinite tolling of the statute of limitations only against out of state corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.152" offset="4548025">Requiring plaintiffs to utilize long arm jurisdiction is a far less burdensome alternative to the present tolling statute, but there, the respondents contend that this is not a burden on interstate commerce at all, this tolling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.302" offset="4624616">That is just plain wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.424" offset="4637155">It is a very heavy burden, because the corporations are subjected to having their assets and... placed under constant jeopardy, being subjected to suits and possibly judgments with local or in state defendants would be able to have dismissed on summary judgment or preliminarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.476" offset="4753348">The lower courts never relied on this justification, presumably because they recognized, as this Court has held in cases like Allenburg, that interstate businesses may not be compelled to register, but the statute effectively requires a registration by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.996" offset="4859405">Indeed, the plaintiff argued in the district court that one of the purposes of the tolling statute was to compel registration by the interstate corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.664" offset="4898066">The defendant is faced with choices under this tolling statute which we believe to be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.051" offset="4939653">On the one hand, it can fail to register, in which case it continues to suffer the burden that has been imposed upon it, and may be paying judgments when other corporations would not have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.248" offset="4992420">On the other hand, it can qualify in New Jersey, but by qualifying, and nothing short of qualification is available, by qualifying, it therefore gives up its right not to be treated as a domestic corporation, and is consenting to any and every suit, whether or not it satisfies the minimum contacts requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.457" offset="5097224">It is subjected also by compulsion to a licensing scheme with all the attendant requirements for maintaining an office, a registered office, filing reports, and paying franchise taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.903" offset="5159082">We also believe this statute violates--</text>

            <text syncTime="1267.368" offset="5196907">We also believe that the tolling statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment, and it is a problem in that it requires the corporation to give up its fundamental right under due process not to be sued in the state unless minimum contacts are met, that there is no substantial relationship between this discrimination and any legitimate state goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.322" offset="5336714">I might add that it is important to realize that even if one were to qualify today, it would not cure the harm caused by the tolling statute, because for two years, the statute of limitations period, the corporation would continue to be subject to suits which may have arisen many years in the past and are still viable because of the prior applicability of the tolling statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.397" offset="5677038">The franchise taxes, Mr. Justice, are based upon our gross income of the amount of business done in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.301" offset="5708593">It is a minimum tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.816" offset="5714654">And they can be exempt from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.487" offset="5725416">There is another section of the New Jersey Corporation Business Act, part of the Act quoted by both counsel and myself, which gives a reporting section, and I know it is not before the Court, but it is the same Act that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.088" offset="5787797">And in the reporting section, a foreign corporation has the option of exempting itself from any franchise taxes by reporting and by having a representative in New Jersey and by filing a form with the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.552" offset="5845684">It is an amendment to the Act which was passed in 1973, and will you indulge me by mentioning it, and permit me to, because of the question raised by the Court today?</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.305" offset="10512616">Presuming that there is any burden, it is so minuscule that I submit to this Court that it is not such that you can overturn a statute which can easily be complied with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.424" offset="10873106">It is not before this Court, because Judge Garth of the Third Circuit said, I do not have to get to the question of whether or not insanity, quote, end quote, constitutes a disability under the tolling provision of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.778" offset="10926500">We argued that the emotional bar of the plaintiff, Susan Cohn, was sufficient so that we could not start this lawsuit until psychiatric treatment was complete in 1974, and that was when we started suit, as soon as we knew that we were able to psychologically and psychiatrically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.348" offset="11004868">Now, that period happened to be very short in this case, but that is not the real reason that this statute could be argued as constitutional or unconstitutional.</text>
