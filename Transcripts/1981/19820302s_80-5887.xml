            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.671" offset="112049">This case comes to use on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.740" offset="132320">The substantive controversy is irrelevant to the issue that prompted us to take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.832" offset="156771">Before trial, the parties reached a settlement agreement favorable to the petitioner, the plaintiff in the case below, but the agreement made no mention of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.108" offset="201806">Four months after the District Court had approved the settlement, the petitioner as a party, primarily prevailing filed a motion for attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.069" offset="245692">Although the respondent argued that the settlement agreement had implicitly waived any such right the District Court awarded fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.137" offset="285920">The Court of Appeals reversed relying on Rule 59(e) or the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, it held that the request for fees was a motion to amend the final judgment which must be made within 10 days of its entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.095" offset="361780">As petitioner had not filed within this period, the Court of Appeals ruled that the request was time barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.379" offset="394903">Rule 59(e) was adopted to permit District Courts to correct errors in their decisions promptly within a 10-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.577" offset="435759">Request for attorney's fees are not applied of the substantive decision of a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.732" offset="468359">On the contrary, they may be awarded under the Fees Act only to the prevailing party and this cannot be determined until a decision on the merits has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.887" offset="512976">Even though Rule 59(e) does not apply, District Courts have discretion to set their own time limits either by a general rule or in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.439" offset="563132">No such limit has been set in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.162" offset="578074">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.526" offset="591553">Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
