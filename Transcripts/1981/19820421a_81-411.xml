            <label>Mr. Joseph S. Kaufman</label>
            <text syncTime="61.664" offset="378401">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.036" offset="391880">This case directly brings before the Court today the provisions of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.142" offset="432318">The issue presented to the Court today is whether by enacting UMTA, and particularly Section 13(c) thereof, Congress silently required federal courts to federalize municipal transit labor relations over federal grant recipients by creating a federal common law to resolve public sector transit labor disputes and thereby preempt state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.160" offset="568363">In the first instance, the District Court in this case answered that question negatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.281" offset="592918">the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in a two-to-one decision reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.420" offset="617474">It implied a federal private right of action by default.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.495" offset="645686">Since the decision of the Sixth Circuit, another Circuit Court has reviewed this matter comprehensively and ruled to the contrary, that being the Eleventh Circuit in the MARTA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.286" offset="708902">This controversy that reaches the Court today is between two private parties, Jackson and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.875" offset="747250">There is no federal interest in the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.249" offset="764700">There are no federal parties presently before this Court, and the substantive outcome of this controversy requires neither construction, interpretation nor vindication of UMTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.883" offset="831260">Additionally, in this case there is no conflict between any federal interest and the law of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.113" offset="872220">Tennessee law clearly establishes collective bargaining between municipalities and its transit workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.422" offset="909418">The outcome of this case will have no substantive... will have no effect on the substantive rights or duties of the United States.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="207.510" offset="961767">Well, that's true in a lot of cases, Mr. Kaufman, where nonetheless a federal right of action has been implied, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="214.009" offset="987785">J. I. Case v. Borak and cases like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="218.569" offset="1006071">--Well, yes, sir, but the J. I. v. Borak has been somewhat cut back by your more recent decisions.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="225.754" offset="1034806">But even in some of our... those cases where a private right of action has been implied, say Cannon v. University of Chicago, there there was no federal party or the United States wasn't a party.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_s_kaufman" startTime="238.607" stopTime="580.658">
            <label>Mr. Joseph S. Kaufman</label>
            <text syncTime="238.607" offset="1086215">But there was a direct command in the statutes involved in those cases which is not true here, as I will point out in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.541" offset="1121950">I might point out, sirs, that UMTA was on the books for some 12 years before the union sought to utilize the federal courts to bring actions such as this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.973" offset="1183599">This was one of the first attempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.816" offset="1191018">If the decision of the Sixth Circuit is affirmed, municipal transit labor relations will be decided in two courts, in state courts as well as federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.060" offset="1259981">Now, the events in this case are somewhat unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.199" offset="1280566">Prior to 1966, for approximately 20 some odd years, there was a private transit operator in Jackson, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.960" offset="1315570">The union represented the transit workers in that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.084" offset="1332079">In 1966 the Jackson Transit Company, as was happening throughout the country with other transit systems, went defunct.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.767" offset="1370845">The city, in its judgment, as a public function, took over the operation of a bus system containing 12 buses and 18 unionized employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.528" offset="1421836">Jackson filed for and received an Urban Mass Transportation Act grant in the amount of $275,000 to assist in acquiring 12 new buses and rehabilitating its maintenance facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.769" offset="1498845">As part of the grant application process Jackson entered into what is commonly known as a Section 13(c) agreement whereby the rights of the workers and the interests of the workers are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.186" offset="1560494">That 13(c) agreement was certified by the Secretary of Labor as creating fair and equitable arrangements for the protection of the interests of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.758" offset="1610754">From 1966 through 1975, Jackson and the union entered into three collective bargaining agreements which were obviously honored since there was no litigation between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.095" offset="1676164">In 1975 a fourth collective bargaining agreement was negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.077" offset="1700092">It contained a COLA provision, a cost-of-living escalator which is the underlying basis of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.262" offset="1732798">The city, after the execution of the agreement, found that it had never been properly ratified by the Board of Commissioners and refused to honor the COLA, and sought to renegotiate the collective bargaining agreement with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.521" offset="1797790">The union declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.973" offset="1807612">It first demanded of the Secretary of Labor that he decertify Jackson for future UMTA grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.157" offset="1848363">The union, in its wisdom, decided to try to make a federal case of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.200" offset="1880546">Now, did Congress, in light of the aforegoing, intend for the federal court in Tennessee to create and apply federal common law to this contract dispute between Jackson and its 18 unionized employees as a result of this single UMTA grant made some ten years previously?</text>
            <text syncTime="461.455" offset="1977617">It is Jackson's position that the answer to this must be emphatically no.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.515" offset="2005829">Congress, through UMTA, and particularly Section 13(c), did not intend to displace the traditional public policy enunciated in both the Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Act excluding by definition state and political subdivisions from all obligations of the Labor-Management Relations Act in order that local governments and communities regulate and manage their affairs and arrangements with their own employees free from federal interference, control and federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.421" offset="2165385">What is UMTA?</text>
            <text syncTime="512.763" offset="2182835">It is a typical federal funding statute which requires at the time of federal assistance certain conditions be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.009" offset="2219825">They include long range transit plans and public hearings thereon, special efforts for the elderly and handicapped, environmental impact statements, charter bus assurances so there will be no competition, and maximum participation by operators in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.969" offset="2307596">One of the conditions is the conditions to protect the interests of the workers, and that is to be determined by the Secretary of Labor, and he must certify that fair and equitable arrangements have been made to protect the interests of the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.259" offset="2380739">Section 13(c) did not create federal collective bargaining rights, and only required the Secretary of Labor during the application process to look at state law and determine if it was hostile to collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.658" offset="2454404">Mr. Kaufman, to what extent is the continuance of state law a binding obligation?</text>
            <text syncTime="589.154" offset="2488363">Suppose after the grant is made the state changes its law, wipes out collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.011" offset="2515844">If that were to happen, Your Honor, there is adequate provision in UMTA itself, in Section 1602(f) and (g) of the law, the Secretary is instructed to bar further grants to those communities which do not comply with their grant contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.642" offset="2598287">There is a cutting off of funding mechanism built right into the act itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.646" offset="3958326">And I think you also have to look at what the legislative history was because time and again both the sponsor of the bill, the Kennedy administration, the floor leader of the bill, Senator Williams, the Chairman of the Committee that handled the bill, Senator Sparkman, and the Floor proponent of the bill, Senator Morse, said time and time again that this was not intended to supersede state law, that it was not intended to override state law or preempt state law in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.477" offset="4089669">It was truly to encourage states to adjust their laws, modify their laws to have collective bargaining, and if they didn't, they wouldn't get the funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.128" offset="4132301">I think probably the best example of how the law was intended to work is in the City of Macon case which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.562" offset="4166052">When the City of Macon refused to make the necessary adjustments to make its laws compatible with collective bargaining, after the Secretary used all kind of jawboning, they didn't get their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.181" offset="4224461">And that's exactly how this act was intended to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.249" offset="4332713">And it has been the consistent national policy to leave the states' handling of their own labor relations to the states without federal interference by either federal administrative bodies such as the NLRB, or the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.114" offset="4588190">We are dealing with situations that have never happened, to the best of my knowledge, where a state has absolutely repealed its law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.049" offset="4619955">Now, we do have situations where states have modified their laws, and there's a matter that's pending before you on cert right now at MBTA where they modified their laws regarding interest arbitration, but it didn't end collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.042" offset="4687874">Now, as I said, UMTA is, must be viewed as a typical federal funding statute such as the Court had before it in Pennhurst, and its purpose was not to create federal transit relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.191" offset="4764569">Its purpose was to salvage, and yes, it was the survival of a badly deteriorated urban mass transit industry in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.826" offset="4815038">It was structured to require local solutions to local problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.775" offset="4838861">13(c) arrangements were to be the product of local negotiation and bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.430" offset="4865506">Neither UMTA nor Section 13(c) contains any express private remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.145" offset="4896331">If one exists, it exists only by implication, and then I respectfully submit, not warranted under the circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.251" offset="4940739">It is clear from the language of the statute itself that UMTA was to meet the requirements of local needs, and it was to improve the mass transit facilities in order to facilitate desirable urban renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.962" offset="5007612">The labor protection were either secondary or ancillary to the main purpose of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.163" offset="5032376">Interestingly, as you read the legislative history, the reason that 13(c) even became an issue was a happening that you suggest, Justice Stevens, in Dade County, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.343" offset="5117118">Dade County had a private transit operator in the early '60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.465" offset="5141568">It, too, went bankrupt, and Dade County took over the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.743" offset="5162675">Because of state law, the employees lost whatever collective bargaining rights they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.787" offset="5198933">They were required to become merit system employees, and they couldn't be represented by a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.392" offset="5233310">It was in that type of factual background that the unions came to the Kennedy administration and said we don't want federal funds to be used to defeat the workers' rights as happened in Dade County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.059" offset="5296004">Congress and the administration had three choices in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.243" offset="5316693">The first was to have full federal involvement akin to the railroad and airline industries, under the Railway Labor Act, in other words, federalized local transit labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.941" offset="5371550">The second option was to keep hands off and do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.252" offset="5388791">And the third option, the one that was eventually adopted, was the carrot and stick approach, to make federal funding attractive so as to have the states that had hostile collective bargaining laws to either modify those laws or work out some innovative arrangement in order to be able to qualify and be eligible for federal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.662" offset="5502372">I want to tell you why that is particularly important in the light of what was happening in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.972" offset="5527658">In 1963 the major transit systems had already gone from the private to the public sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.733" offset="5570708">New York City, Chicago, L.A., Boston, Seattle, Oakland, California, Cleveland, just to name a few, had already made the transition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.807" offset="5618982">They were already governed by state law procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.617" offset="5634238">Now, if that was the case, we would have two classes of systems, those who were later going to fall into the same trend and who were still governed by federal law at that time, and those that had already made the transition, the major systems that needed the money most of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.469" offset="5709679">I don't think Congress ever intended to have two classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.217" offset="5724621">They intended to have a situation to make it, as Justice Rehnquist said in the Pennhurst case, to have a nudge, an ability to try to get an accommodation with state law so it would not be hostile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.727" offset="5790659">At no time in this case was Tennessee law antagonistic to what was intended here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.345" offset="14397170">Not one Congressman, not one Senator, and not one word in the debates would ever lead you to that conclusion.</text>
