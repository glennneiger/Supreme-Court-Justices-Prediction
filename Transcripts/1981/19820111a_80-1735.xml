            <text syncTime="72.279" offset="425281">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.897" offset="439805">This is a Freedom of Information Act case here on writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.801" offset="467390">At issue is Exemption 7 of the FOIA which exempts from mandatory disclosure investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent that production of such records would cause one of six discrete harms listed by Congress in Exemption 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.714" offset="551086">The question presented is whether records in the FBI's law enforcement files that satisfy Exemption 7, and hence that are exempt from mandatory disclosure, lose that exempt status when they are later summarized into another FBI document that was not compiled for purposes of law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.378" offset="641679">And the documents involved in this case are so-called name check summaries concerning eleven individuals that were prepared by the FBI in October 1969 in response to a request by John Ehrlichman, who was then the counsel to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.340" offset="717539">The FBI frequently prepares name check summaries at the request of the White House, generally when someone is being considered for a presidential appointment or for an invitation to a White House function.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.897" offset="767798">When the FBI got the White House request in this case, it, as it did in other name check requests, checked its law enforcement records and wrote a short memorandum summarizing its file information about each of the eleven individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.959" offset="836030">In the case of a few of the individuals the FBI files included a name check summary that had been prepared in response to an earlier White House request.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="193.986" offset="912203">A number of agencies in the federal government, including the White House, when they need certain information for perfectly lawful purposes about a particular individual, they will ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation to check its files and run what is called a name check on that individual and notify the agency of anything pertinent that they may have found.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.936" offset="996004">And as I said, the White House frequently would send over name check requests to the FBI; for example, when the President was thinking of naming somebody to a presidential appointment or someone was being considered for an invitation to a White House function, there would have to be some security checks and other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.939" offset="1903916">Now, there was substantial debate both prior to and after the veto as to what the thrust of these amendments would be, and proponents of these amendments, such as Senator Hart and Senator Kennedy, repeatedly assured their colleagues that no information, no matters, no records, no documents in the FBI's law enforcement records would have to be turned over to any FOIA requester if one of these six discrete harms listed in the statute would occur as a result of production.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.401" offset="2285826">Also, when you're dealing with personal privacy, as this Court noted in the Rose case, Exemption 7(C) imposes on the Government a somewhat easier test to meet than Exemption 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.572" offset="5094512">Now, perhaps the best way to explain the error in the Court of Appeals' mechanical and excessively literal approach is to give a fairly typical example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.178" offset="5132964">Suppose the FBI compiled an investigatory record for law enforcement purposes; in other words, a record that clearly meets the threshold test of Exemption 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.033" offset="5168386">And for simplicity's sake let's assume that that record is two paragraphs long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.271" offset="5189284">Now, if there was a request for that record, there's no question that the FBI or any law enforcement agency could refuse it under Exemption 7, assuming one of the six harms could be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.329" offset="5233483">Now, if instead the FBI were to xerox that record or repeat it verbatim in a second record which was not compiled for purposes of law enforcement, then the D.C. Circuit would say it could still be withheld because it is still the same record; it hasn't been changed in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.339" offset="5301611">However, if that second document rather than repeating the two paragraphs verbatim repeated only one of those two paragraphs, or repeated the two paragraphs but changed one sentence in the two paragraphs or added a new sentence, or, as in this case, instead of repeating the two paragraphs verbatim it had summarized or paraphrased those two paragraphs, then the D.C. Circuit would say at that point it's a new record, it has to be turned over, even though it would contain the identical information that was in the two paragraphs as it sat in its original source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.262" offset="5437238">We don't think that any test that could lead to these sort of results could possibly be what Congress intended when it intended in 1974 to wipe out the somewhat formal interpretation of Exemption 7 that the D.C. Circuit had given it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.687" offset="5502962">And perhaps I can give another example that will bring me the foolishness of the D.C. Circuit's approach in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.091" offset="5528562">The Respondent in this case made an FOIA request for all of the documents that were sent over to the White House in 1969 in response to the Ehrlichman request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.297" offset="5573389">As a result, what the FBI found were these name check summaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.749" offset="5587181">But let's assume instead Respondent had made a request in 1976 for all of the information in the FBI's files about Cesar Chavez, for example, one of the eleven individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.223" offset="5641098">What the FBI would have done is it would have gone to its Cesar Chavez file, and it would have found two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.710" offset="5667011">It would have found first the underlying information that it had on Cesar Chavez, clearly exempt; and it would have found the summaries that were prepared in 1969 which did nothing more than summarize the underlying information that it had on Cesar Chavez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.819" offset="5727511">Document B is identical to Document A except it summarizes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.937" offset="5743916">The same harms would occur from release of Document B that would occur from the release of Document A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.555" offset="5766381">It might well be a serious invasion of Cesar Chavez's privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.043" offset="5780383">Yet the D.C. Circuit would require the FBI to turn over those summaries, but would allow the FBI to retain the underlying records that had been summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.267" offset="5829284">Once again, we think that this could not possibly be what Congress had in mind in 1974 when it intended to wipe out and overrule the line of excessively literal decisions of the D.C. Circuit under Exemption 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.642" offset="5982780">But a person, no, would not be refused his own records under Exemption 7(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.760" offset="5999289">In fact, in this case when Respondent's first request came in and asked for information about eleven named individuals, the FBI's initial response was would you please give us notarized statements from these eleven individuals saying that they don't mind that we give out the information on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.072" offset="6072536">Now, the hypothetical that I gave a moment ago is not farfetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.293" offset="6089359">I think it's almost exactly the situation in this case with respect to the so-called attachments that I mentioned at the beginning of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.863" offset="6119661">As I mentioned earlier, some of these attachments are on their face quite clearly complete memoranda prepared prior to 1969 pursuant to previous totally legitimate White House name check requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.972" offset="6176086">These memos were in the FBI's law enforcement files before the Ehrlichman request was made, and they were incorporated in and attached to the documents sent over to the White House in 1969 in response to the Ehrlichman request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.966" offset="6232092">The Court of Appeals remanded this aspect of the case, the attachments aspect of the case, to the District Court to determine whether these attachments were originally compiled for law enforcement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.874" offset="6275664">If they were and if the disclosure would work an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, then the Court of Appeals would allow the FBI to withhold them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.296" offset="6313385">However, if the FBI instead of attaching these documents when they sent them over to John Ehrlichman had instead summarized them, the same information would be going over, but at that point the summaries could not be withheld because they weren't the original documents, and the court would have found that they were not prepared for purposes of law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.757" offset="6387260">And we think that this distinction between duplicate law enforcement records and records that are substantially identical but not exact duplicates is just the sort of mechanical and senseless approach to Exemption 7 that Congress wanted to eliminate in the 1974 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.303" offset="6453402">I think this approach is responsive to none of the concerns that underlie the exemption, and it would lead to anomalous results, some of which I mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.707" offset="6487047">The harms that can occur from the release of a law enforcement record can occur just as easily from the release of a summary of that record, and those harms don't depend at all on the purpose for which the summary was prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.049" offset="6540442">We therefore think that the Court should reject the D.C. Circuit's formal approach and literalistic approach and reverse the judgment below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.290" offset="13489326">As mentioned, they did originally raise it when they originally refused to give the Respondent any access to any of the documents, but they did not raise it at the District Court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.865" offset="13543661">And after the District Court ruled that the information was not compiled for law enforcement purposes, and instead of releasing the information at that time gave Petitioners another chance to show that the information was in fact exempt under the Freedom of Information Act, Petitioners still did not raise Exemption 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.240" offset="13693186">It's a question of a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.773" offset="13699351">The Exemption 7, you must first reach the threshold question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.866" offset="13759642">But it is a higher standard, and as Petitioner did finally shed light onto why they might not have raised Exemption 6 earlier, it is a higher standard; and it's a higher standard to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.875" offset="13819723">When you're talking about eleven public figures, some of whom are no longer living, individuals; when the Petitioners made no attempt to ascertain whether or not any of these individuals are concerned about the disclosure that are in the question; where it's shown, as I mentioned, that Respondent began this investigation... began his search for this information because of one of the eleven individuals making him aware of the file, which Petitioners have been aware of; and the fact that there is no... we don't know whether or not the information in these files have already been included... been dispersed into the public domain... as I mentioned earlier, there's a question of how some of this information was used, and if it was in fact used previously, it was dispersed already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.510" offset="14034241">Respondent has no way of deciding what this information is without seeing the information.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="3536.417" offset="14281882">Well, that's right, but it's not necessarily a presumption you have to indulge in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.119" offset="14292644">There's actually evidence, unrebutted evidence in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.254" offset="14309258">And second, I'd like to just point out the irony of the Respondent's interpretation of the FOIA here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.558" offset="14334440">If John Ehrlichman had had a law enforcement purpose for making this 1969 request, then all of the information sent over to him in 1969, including the name check summaries, presumably would have been compiled for law enforcement purpose and could be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.187" offset="14396925">However, since the District Court found that John Ehrlichman was instead motivated by a desire to invade people's privacies for reasons unrelated to law enforcement, the result is that the FBI now has to open up all of its files about these people's privacy to any FOIA requestor who asks to see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.164" offset="14476860">It does not make a great deal of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.283" offset="14485323">Finally, in terms of the underlying purposes of the FOIA and whether they would be served by the Respondent's interpretation here, we think it's important to point out that in response to the Respondent's FOIA request, he learned of the John Ehrlichman request, he got a copy of the letter that the FBI sent to John Ehrlichman in response to that request, he got virtually all of the documents that were sent over from the FBI to the White House in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.952" offset="14600053">The only thing we're debating here is whether certain small snippets of this information, the disclosure of which would cause one of the specific harms listed in Exemption 7, must be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.593" offset="14650626">We think that the threshold test is clearly met here, and Judge Ritchie found that Exemption 7(C) was also met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.597" offset="14678629">We therefore think that the FBI was entitled to withheld this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.151" offset="14692840">Thank you.</text>
