            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="127162">We will hear arguments next in Blue Shield of Virginia against McCready.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.718" offset="149941">Mr. Bell.</text>

            <label>Mr. Griffin B. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="31.499" offset="253072">May it please the Court, this case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.355" offset="288494">The first question is, was there an antitrust injury alleged so as to withstand a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), and I use antitrust injury in the same vein as this Court used it in Brunswick versus Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.138" offset="379714">The second question, was Blue Shield exempt from antitrust laws as being in the business of insurance under the McCarren-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.795" offset="430287">This was a class action with one plaintiff purporting to represent the class.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="83.134" stopTime="88.372">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="83.134" offset="459649">The class she claims to represent are the patients, are they not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="griffin_b_bell" startTime="88.372" stopTime="434.911">
            <label>Mr. Griffin B. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="88.372" offset="480546">Patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.872" offset="482636">Well, the patients, all patients who went to a clinical psychologist and who at the same time were entitled to benefits under Blue Shield contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.763" offset="530179">This plaintiff was an employee of Prince William County.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.648" offset="549719">Prince William County had a contract for medical services which they purchased from Blue Shield of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.487" offset="585036">Plaintiff was treated by a clinical psychologist, and sought reimbursement from Blue Shield of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.426" offset="620772">That is the gist of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.747" offset="634146">She wishes to be reimbursed.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.197" offset="639893">Her request for reimbursal was refused on the grounds that the plan only covered physician's services and other allied health services which are supervised by and billed through a physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.173" offset="703841">The case is complicated by the fact that there was another case filed at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.712" offset="738009">They started out being heard together, and one was decided last year by the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.884" offset="766640">It is called the VACP case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.170" offset="775835">In that case, the district court ruled for the Blue Shield plans and psychiatrists, but the Fourth Circuit said that there was a restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.061" offset="823378">The restraint was in the sector or area of restraining clinical psychologists by not covering them under these contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.785" offset="874264">It was a plan that was devised, so the court held, by the two plans, two plans in Virginia, both of whom are in this case, along with the doctors and particularly the psychiatrists, to block out the clinical psychologist from being covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.049" offset="959319">Now, that is the antitrust allegation that is the base for this case brought by this patient of a psychologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.292" offset="1012295">I am going to spend a little time arguing the McCarren-Ferguson point, because this Court granted certiorari on a Second Circuit case called Pireno, and it is pending here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.134" offset="1075616">It is very much on our case, and if we are exempt from antitrust coverage by McCarren-Ferguson, then you wouldn't necessarily reach the other point which is antitrust injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.994" offset="1139041">Unfortunately, though, the questions tie together because it has been held at one point in the case, in the district court, that there was a boycott, so if there was a boycott, then we have to get back to the same issue, target area, was Mrs. McCready in the sector or the area where the antitrust violation took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.144" offset="1251681">There are three elements that must appear to have an exemption under the McCarren-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.731" offset="1274042">First, there must be the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.750" offset="1290133">Second, there has to be state regulation of the activity in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.654" offset="1309778">And third, it must appear that there is no boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.023" offset="1327227">There can't be a boycott and still have coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.443" offset="1348857">They have the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.979" offset="1358992">Now, there is no doubt there was state regulation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.132" offset="1379681">That is what the lawsuit was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.648" offset="1385742">The two plans would not follow the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.019" offset="1399221">They contested it, and finally lost, but they won part of the case, and that was that the Virginia Supreme Court said the statute required that they deal directly with psychologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.862" offset="1466512">The Virginia Supreme Court said that that was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.898" offset="1478738">It was not corrected up until July 1, 1979, so we are talking about damages that accrued before July 1, 1979, but I don't think it is contested, the the state regulation, so if this was the business of insurance, this policy that they had that you could only get allied health or medical... health services through a doctor, if that was underwriting or spreading of the risk within the meaning of the Royal Drug case, then we have the question... we have the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.408" offset="1640697">So, the only element left to be decided would be, was there a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.712" offset="1665983">Now, the Boycott that the District Court found, Judge Bond, this is the only mention that has been made of this in all this litigation, was that there was a boycott alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.304" offset="1720318">Well, at that time, he was dealing with a motion to dismiss involving the doctors and the plans as well as Mrs. McCready's case, and I read that to mean he was talking about a boycott in this primary level or this sector between doctors and psychologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.337" offset="1812478">If so, then the same answer would come from the argument I am next going to make about antitrust injury would indicate that there was no boycott, so that's why I say that the two issues tie together.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="434.911" offset="1866708">Mr. Bell, I am not sure that I understand how we properly reach the McCarren-Ferguson Act issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.000" offset="1899100">Now, the court of appeals didn't consider it, did it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="griffin_b_bell" startTime="445.952" stopTime="450.070">
            <label>Mr. Griffin B. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="445.952" offset="1910907">The court of appeals ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.752" offset="1918117">Well, I won't say ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.154" offset="1923760">They did not consider it.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="450.070" offset="1927417">And so normally, presumably, we wouldn't get into it, and does this case come to us on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="griffin_b_bell" startTime="463.062" stopTime="463.914">
            <label>Mr. Griffin B. Bell</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="463.914" offset="1982796">And we have to assume that the allegations of the complaint are considered favorably to the pleader, and has the plaintiff below at least allege both a boycott and coercion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="griffin_b_bell" startTime="481.458" stopTime="484.993">
            <label>Mr. Griffin B. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="481.458" offset="2052909">They alleged a boycott twice in there, in the complaint.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="484.993" offset="2067120">So I wasn't sure how we would get into the McCarren-Ferguson Act issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="griffin_b_bell" startTime="490.314" stopTime="538.212">
            <label>Mr. Griffin B. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="490.314" offset="2088331">Well, this was in the district court, and the court of appeals did not consider it, and it was called to the court of appeals' attention on the petition for rehearing, and I would assume that the Court can deal with any issue that is in the case as a part of the case, but I think that the short answer to the question is that in spite of the fact that a boycott is alleged, if the Court should conclude that the injury suffered by Mrs. McCready was not in the area of the antitrust violation, then there couldn't be a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.391" offset="2260635">Even if there was a boycott, it would not relate to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.728" offset="2277980">It wouldn't--</text>

            <label>Mr. Griffin B. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="548.782" offset="2322284">So, I will go... I will just mention one other thing about McCarren-Ferguson, and then I will discontinue that argument, and that is that in the Royal Drug case, and there have been some other cases... there is one case in the Fourth Circuit where they said that peer review was the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.111" offset="2415593">Pireno in the Second Circuit says peer review is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.563" offset="2425311">Well, this question we have, it seems to me, whether we ought to cover clinical psychologists, goes to the heart of the relationship between an insurer and a subscriber or policy-holder, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.144" offset="2503678">It also goes to the heart of underwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.263" offset="2520187">Do you care to underwrite, do you wish to underwrite this kind of business, and how will the risk be spread?</text>
            <text syncTime="605.285" offset="2548295">Is the mechanics of it such that it bears directly on spreading the risk?</text>
            <text syncTime="609.486" offset="2565013">I think it does, but I will go on to the next argument, because the next argument would end the case if we are right about it, and that is antitrust injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.794" offset="2610258">Was there an antitrust injury here within the meaning of the decision in Brunswick versus Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.686" offset="2653830">The Fourth Circuit cited only two cases in support of their rule, and one was Reiter versus Sonotone, a case involving a direct purchaser and price fixing, nothing like this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.361" offset="2716524">They cited their own case of South Carolina Council of Milk Producers, where there had been a breakdown in the competitive level of the retail marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.550" offset="2757275">Milk was being sold as a loss leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.085" offset="2771485">The farmers, the milk producers brought a suit saying that it was adversely affecting the price of milk, and the Fourth Circuit went off on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.195" offset="2831880">One was whether these milk producers were in the sector of the economy which was endangered by the antitrust activity, the breakdown in competition, and then whether there was proximate cause which would lead from that to these milk producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.172" offset="2911815">They decided this case almost on the same basis, which I think converts the antitrust law almost into a general tort statute, and it is difficult, though, to take any of the rules I have found in the country, in all the cases in the circuits, and the learned treatises, and apply them to facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.454" offset="3008886">Judge Bond said it pretty well in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.525" offset="3033232">He said that while standing an antitrust injury may not be the same issue, here there is no standing because there is no antitrust injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.713" offset="3073983">He put it... he tested it rather than starting out with a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.748" offset="3094150">I think that Judge Mansfield in the Calderone case almost hit onto a workable formula, but he kept changing from target area to target, and I suppose there can be sometimes where you wouldn't be a direct target, yet you would still be covered if the... if you were in the area of the breakdown in the economy, so I first got off on the idea that maybe we ought to talk about targets, but I'm not certain that's the way to do it, and I end up, after looking at all the cases, where there seems to be two clear groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.508" offset="3261124">One is what some of the writers call categorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.062" offset="3275335">That would be like a landlord or shareholder, a creditor who doesn't have standing to complain about the antitrust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.252" offset="3320161">And then the others, it seemed to me to get down to whether you are too far away from where the breakdown in the economy took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.809" offset="3366346">This seems to me to be that kind of a case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="814.594" offset="3385467">Mr. Attorney General, it sounds like that particular approach and maybe the target area, too, is just an early way in the case to decide the question of causation, and to avoid a long trial on that if it's clear enough, because even if you lose at this stage, you are going to be making the same argument down on the end of the case that whatever injury that was suffered here wasn't caused by the breakdown in competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.323" offset="3672396">Exactly, and we think the Fourth Circuit treated it just like tort injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.459" offset="3688906">Antitrust injury carries treble damages and attorneys' fees, and we don't think Congress... in fact this Court said so in Brunswick, that it was to be a narrower category, and the question, the problem is how to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.754" offset="3762153">It is very difficult to draw the line, but in this case it seems to me that this lady is two steps away.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.667" offset="3849820">She could get a doctor or get a clinical psychologist, and that was unrestrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.321" offset="3872390">The restraint was farther over, between the doctors and these plans for not covering clinical psychologists, so we... our argument is that if there was an antitrust violation, which the Fourth Circuit held in the other case, then you have to define the sector of the economy and draw a line around it or circle it, and then the next step, was she injured by something that happened within that circle, and we say she was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.065" offset="5563348">The allegations in the complaint in the other case that esteemed counsel referred to, the VACP case, are identical to the operative acts of antitrust violation charged in this complaint that is before the Court on this appeal from the reversal of an order dismissing a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.966" offset="5670973">Now, there are a couple of preliminary remarks I wanted to make before I pick up the questions of legal injury or antitrust injury and the possibility of McCarren-Ferguson exemption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.023" offset="5715172">First, the Petitioners' arguments in their brief are shot through with factual assertions that the Respondent here can't be injured, or she can't prove an antitrust violation as to her, and coupled with other assertions as to why their practices are defensible, and why they are the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.722" offset="5805973">It seems to me these factual assertions miss the mark in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.258" offset="5824155">These assertions for the most part are contested, if not bitterly contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.161" offset="5847769">To take one example, they argue that she cannot recover because her health insurance contract precludes payments to clinical psychologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.052" offset="5887266">By contrast, we contend, based on the unanimous decision by the court of appeals in the VACP case, and the evidence in that record, that for many years Blue Shield interpreted the very same contracts at issue here to treat clinical psychologists as physicians and to pay them directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.549" offset="5973262">More specifically, from 1962 to 1972, they did interpret the contracts to pay clinical psychologists.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.698" offset="11501921">--months down the road when the facts are developed, but it certainly isn't a defense at this stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.621" offset="11529611">To try to sum up on this part of the argument, she meets all of the classic tests that the lower courts have imposed of antitrust standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.678" offset="11577781">To cut off her complaint at this early stage of the proceeding would serve no important federal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.284" offset="11612262">There are no reasons to cut the complaint off now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.986" offset="11623025">There would be no double recovery, as in the landlord case possibility, no complex problems of proof or apportionment of damages, and proceeding with her case would not in any way interfere with competition in the health care market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.044" offset="11675270">Allowing her case to go forward would ensure at least the possibility of compensation to her, and would discourage defendants from adopting restrictive practices which could ultimately if successful exclude psychologists by making it too expensive for subscribers to consult them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.855" offset="11746532">So that we believe that if the court has to harmonize any kind of restriction rule at all on the language of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, as per Brunswick, it simply should be that we shouldn't allow an antitrust plaintiff to go forward as possibly in Brunswick where actually the recovery of damages would tend to defeat competition rather than promote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.954" offset="11838901">Here, by making her whole and making the defendants stop their practice of refusing to pay her, we also encourage competition, and in that light, she certainly should be allowed to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.678" offset="11889787">Now, I want to just very quickly speak to the McCarren-Ferguson Act exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.832" offset="11906401">We allege a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.482" offset="11913089">That is sufficient under Barry to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.201" offset="11923955">More importantly, even if the business of insurance was an issue here, it certainly cannot come up on a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.355" offset="11952481">There is nothing in McCready's complaint that talks about underwriting of risk, distribution of risk, or insurance contracts, and if... under Royal Drug, if the defendants want to demonstrate that their decision, which we say was simply an antitrust conspiracy, was in fact an insurance decision, they have the affirmative obligation of proving that in a plenary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.320" offset="12048403">There is nothing in the complaint that allows them to even make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.874" offset="12066584">Therefore, the McCarren-Ferguson Act exemption is not properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.176" offset="12087795">For all of these reasons, we think the case must be--</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.544" offset="12293327">On the motion to dismiss, the idea of a motion to dismiss, counsel opposite says we ought to have a full-scale hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.268" offset="12340138">As I understand the administration of the judicial process, courts decide cases like Brunswick to teach lower courts and lawyers how to handle complicated matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.242" offset="12392070">Now, if our case does fit into Brunswick, then we would be entitled to a judgment of dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.932" offset="12426865">That gets down to just one real... one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.884" offset="12442643">There is only one thing dividing us, as I understand the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.717" offset="12453928">We both... he... The argument is that... Mrs. McCready's argument, that you have to have an antitrust violation and causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.108" offset="12495515">That is all you have to allege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.894" offset="12502724">I say that Brunswick teaches one other step, one other factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.779" offset="12522264">You have an antitrust violation, and then you have to have a sector or market in which competition is injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.003" offset="12563120">Now, that is said in Brunswick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.605" offset="12573569">It says there that antitrust laws are designed to protect competition, but not competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.942" offset="12602930">Now, the competition, it is without doubt in this case that the competition injured is between the psychiatrists and the clinical psychologists, so you have to have causation that relates to that, to that area, so you have to define that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.890" offset="12706689">Supposing the doctors had gotten together and said, we are going to boycott the banks in order to get the banks to refuse to do business with the psychologists in order to drive them out of business, and they were successful, and some banks lost business as a result of the boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.965" offset="12758933">Now, they are aiming at the psychologists, but they hurt the banks in accomplishing their objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.846" offset="12942522">They say that the plan is a plan under which payment for psychological services are made when those services are rendered by a physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.070" offset="12991423">That was the plan in which she was a subscriber through the county, but on the example Justice Stevens just gave, it is sort of typical of this area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.131" offset="13063626">On the landlord question, I finally decided that all those cases fitted into something you would call derivative.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.112" offset="13143560">I have not argued that, but she is a policyholder under this plan, and she is almost in the shape of a derivative right, but you can't decide this case under any sort of a magic of what has been held in a lot of other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.871" offset="13202597">It is sort of, I'd say... each case has to go on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.156" offset="13219733">You have to have some general principles, and I think those three factors that I just gave are the factors, and not the two that my opposition argues for.</text>
