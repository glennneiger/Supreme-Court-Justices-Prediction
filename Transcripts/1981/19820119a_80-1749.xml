            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133237">We will hear arguments next in... 80-1749, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.028" offset="177332">Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed when you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="79.156" offset="449841">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.077" offset="461544">At issue in this case is the constitutionality of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, one of five statutes enacted in 1978 as part of a comprehensive effort to deal with this nation's energy problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.977" offset="525074">It would be helpful to consider the statute in two basic parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.116" offset="541688">The first part consists of Titles I and III, which share three common statutorily-identified goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.924" offset="572930">The first is to promote the conservation of energy supplied by utilities; second is to optimize the efficient use of facilities and resources by utilities; and the third is to ensure equitable rights to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.936" offset="628937">Title I deals with electricity, and Title III with gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.386" offset="646700">Title I requires state regulatory authorities and non-regulated electric utilities to consider the adoption of one set of standards, six in number, dealing with electric rates, and a second set of standards, five in number, dealing with terms and conditions of electric service.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.924" offset="724858">The rate standards, all of them, and some of the electric service standards are directed toward two objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.235" offset="750145">The first is to cut down the amount of electric energy, and therefore imported oil, that is consumed in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.420" offset="774909">And the second objective is to shift electric demand away from peak periods, thereby diminishing the use of less efficient generating facilities and scarce fuels; notably, oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.477" offset="827049">As to gas, Title III requires consideration of only two of the terms service standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.240" offset="858187">Each of the standards, both Title I and Title III, is to be considered in a hearing after public notice, and a written statement of the reasons for declining to implement or adopt... in the event of a declamation to implement or adopt... any of the standards is to be made available to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.951" offset="929031">In addition, Titles I and III require that within one year after enactment of the statute and annually thereafter for ten years, state regulatory authorities and non-regulated utilities report the progress of their consideration of these standards to the Secretary of Energy who in turn is to submit a summary and analysis of the reports to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.505" offset="1015235">The other part of the statute is Title II, probably the most controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.864" offset="1028610">Specifically, Section 210, whose objective is to encourage the development of cogeneration and small power production facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.499" offset="1071137">Cogeneration is the combined product of both electrical energy and useful thermal energy such as heat or steam from a single process.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.683" offset="1111888">It has great potential as a source of energy conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.322" offset="1126517">At one time it accounted for some 15 % of this nation's energy total, but with the advent of cheap fossil fuel power, that has diminished to 4 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.053" offset="1169358">A small power production facility is a facility having a capacity of no more than 80 megawatts and using something other fossil fuels, defined by the statute as biomass, waste, geothermal or renewable resources such as wind, water, solar energy, for the purpose of producing electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.153" offset="1249815">Congress identified two impediments to the potential of cogeneration and small power production facilities as additional sources of domestic power with consequent lessening of dependence on foreign oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.241" offset="1306135">The first was its conclusion that subjecting cogeneration and small power production facilities to the usual state and federal regulatory burdens was unnecessary and would unduly discourage their development.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.299" offset="1358380">The more controversial aspect of the congressional determination was the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.296" offset="1382413">These two types of facilities must rely on traditional electric utilities, both as a source of backup power, and also as a market for their surplus power.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.417" offset="1422850">They do not sell generally to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.260" offset="1430269">They use them only for their own purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.681" offset="1435911">Evidence before Congress showed that since these facilities are potential competitors of public utilities, utilities were often less than cooperative in supplying either backup power or markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.395" offset="1490768">PURPA deals with each of these impediments.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.644" offset="1503725">Its response to the problem of surplus and backup power is the most hotly-contested of the Act's provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.954" offset="1532982">What Congress eventually adopted in this respect represents a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.655" offset="1551790">The administration's proposal, which passed the House and was sent to the Senate, would have established a regulatory program virtually identical to that upheld by this Court in the Virginia Surface Mining Act case last term, under which the regulatory burden would have been assumed by federal authorities in the event that state authorities chose not to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.723" offset="1652101">At the other end of the spectrum, the Senate bill would have required the Secretary to follow basically the Title I/Title III approach, which is simply to recommend guidelines to state public service commissions that they could adopt or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.061" offset="1705390">Opponents of the administration House bill, by the time it got to the Senate, presented to Congress substantial testimony and arguments to the effect that it was state rather than federal officials who possess the necessary expertise to implement reforms.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.804" offset="1772368">The legislation dealing with these issues should be responsive to local needs and local differences, and that what might be appropriate for Florida might not necessarily be appropriate for Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.534" offset="1823359">And that the states should be allowed to continue to experiment in the national interest with different regulatory approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.485" offset="1851154">The compromise that became law was responsive to these arguments, which were grounded in the preservation of state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.418" offset="1886889">The Act, in fact, gives the authority to make general rules to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to achieve the general objectives of the Act, but with the more specific authority to implement the statute being left to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.974" offset="1953031">The Commission has, in fact, adopted regulations which afford the states great latitude in determining how the congressional objectives are to be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.830" offset="1988453">Under these regulations, state implementation may be accomplished by any one of three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.781" offset="2020323">First of all, by the issuance of regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.107" offset="2029622">Second, and probably most important for purposes of this lawsuit, by the resolution of disputes between utilities and qualifying facilities on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.523" offset="2083226">And the third is a general catch-all; by any other action reasonably designed to give effect to the Commission's rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.348" offset="2110602">This suit was brought by the state of Mississippi and its public service commission with Mississippi Power and Light being permitted to intervene, against the Secretary of Energy who has general responsibility for Titles I and III, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which has general responsibility for Title II, Section 210, seeking a declaratory judgment that the entire Act is beyond the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause power and an unconstitutional invasion of state sovereignty as declared by this Court in National League of Cities and Towns v. Usery.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.381" offset="2246752">Judge Cox's decision holding the statute unconstitutional on both grounds preceded this Court's decision in Hodel v. Indiana and Virginia Surface Mining, and this appeal followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.186" offset="2321880">There are two independent reasons in the government's view why the decision of the lower court must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.292" offset="2354377">First,--</text>

            <text syncTime="555.995" offset="2357198">May I ask, Mr. Lee, you did say that whatever federal regulations are needed have now been promulgated?</text>

            <text syncTime="564.773" offset="2392306">And they are extremely deferential to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.819" offset="2408502">They leave to the states as much discretion as the proponents of that approach before Congress said they should--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="576.378" stopTime="707.935">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="576.378" offset="2438700">--They were adopted... I'll find that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.110" offset="2457613">The two reasons why this decision must be reversed, in our view, are, first, applying the standards announced by this Court in Hodel and earlier in Usery, there is no constitutional violation, looking at it as an exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause power.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.384" offset="2538697">And second, the Act is also a legitimate exercise of Congress' power to provide for our national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.287" offset="2566282">I will look at the Commerce Clause issues first.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.785" offset="2588329">Last term in the Virginia Surface Mining case, this Court identified three hurdles plus a balancing test that a challenge to a congressional exercise of the Commerce power on Tenth Amendment grounds must surmount.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.312" offset="2646426">Before turning to a specific discussion of those three issues, however, I would like first to point out the aspect of this case that distinguishes it from National League of Cities and Towns v. Usery, and simply makes the rationale of that case inapplicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.162" offset="2717792">The evil against which this Court's holding in National League of Cities and Towns protects is intrusion by one sovereign in a federal system into the prerogatives of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.392" offset="2770768">And that problem simply does not exist where, as here, the only reason that the states are exercising authority in the field at all is that Congress chooses to permit them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.199" offset="2825939">This difference between the Act in both of the predecessors to this case and this case is illustrated both by the history and also by the content of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.944" offset="2860943">The appellees concede, as they must, that the state functions of whose federal invasion they complain could have been totally preempted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.314" offset="2906396">The reason that Congress did not do so is that it was persuaded by the advocates of Federalism that the wiser policy and the more effective policy was to preserve a larger role for the states.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="707.935" stopTime="720.944">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="707.935" offset="2964910">Mr. Lee, do you think Congress could direct, for instance, a state legislature to consider certain statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="716.898" offset="3000750">Mandate that under the Tenth Amendment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="720.944" stopTime="738.719">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="720.944" offset="3016946">I believe, Justice O'Connor, that if it was in an area, that if it was in an area, that clearly could be preempted by Congress, in which Congress itself could have acted, and then Congress--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="738.719" offset="3088104">So in the Commerce area you would argue that Congress could go so far as to even mandate state legislatures to consider certain laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.746" offset="3128124">--Of course, the word "mandate" triggers sensitive nerves in the Tenth Amendment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.634" offset="3155709">But mandate a consideration, particularly in a circumstance such as you have in Titles I and III where the only obligation is simply to consider but not to adopt one way or the other--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="771.393" stopTime="788.091">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="771.393" offset="3218716">But these public utility commissions of states are an administrative arm of the Legislative Branch of the government, and they are being told that they must consider certain action.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.763" offset="3268244">They are not being told they have to implement it, but they must consider it, isn't that so?</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="788.091" offset="3285590">--That is absolutely correct, and for reasons that I attempt to discuss, we believe that that is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.508" offset="3315265">The principal reason is, aside from the three hurdles, when you consider the balance of relevant interests, state and federal, particularly as applied to this kind of case, it is not that much of an intrusion, certainly not an unconstitutional intrusion, when you're dealing in areas like the Commerce Clause... and I reiterate that there is no dispute in this case that the turf on which we are operating is federal turf... it is congressional turf, the kind of regulatory area in which Congress could legislate if it chose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.395" offset="3506795">Instead, what Congress concluded was that its federal purposes would be better served if it permitted the states to consider certain basic objectives, not to adopt them but simply to consider them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.908" offset="5088770">But the more persuasive distinction is that whatever the distinction, whatever the comparative intrusion on state interests, I think the best judge of that has to be the states themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.606" offset="5151568">And it was organizations such as the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and others that presented extensive testimony before the Senate saying do not adopt the Virginia Surface Mining model because if you do, three things will happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.823" offset="5632430">At least if they did, they did a very sophisticated job of it in presenting their evidence before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.007" offset="5661165">I'd like to deal now with the compliance by the states with the Section 210 requirements for the sale of surplus power and the purchase of backup power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.875" offset="5724695">There are three opportunities; there are three ways that the states are given to comply, and the third one, of course, is the very broad one, "any other means" by which the policies of the federal regulation may be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.667" offset="5791882">But one of those options is simply to entertain disputes between regulated utilities on the one hand and qualifying facilities, cogeneration or small power production facilities, on the other on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.643" offset="5863771">Thus viewed, all that Section 210, as certainly as implemented by the FERC regulations, does is simply to provide a federal rule of decision that is applicable in those cases where the state entertains lawsuits for other type of adjudicatory proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.384" offset="5954677">Thus viewed, regardless of what the constitutional rule might be in the event that regulations had been required,... in further answer to Justice O'Connor's question... or that legislation had been required, that obligation can be performed, can be satisfied, simply by entertaining disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.094" offset="6037537">And that brings the case squarely within this Court's holding in Testa v. Katt, that it is not unconstitutional for the federal government, for Congress, to supply the rule of decision applicable in state adjudicatory proceedings so long as that same kind of rule, if enacted as a source of state law, would be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.820" offset="6124473">I'd like to say just a word about the comparative weight of the federal and the state interests in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.782" offset="6176300">This case demonstrates better than either of predecessor the wisdom of what this Court implied in National League of Cities and Towns, and expressly stated in the Virginia Surface Mining case, that the federal interest... that regardless of the three tests, that the federal interest nevertheless may be such that it justifies state submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.931" offset="6264907">On the federal side of the balance scale, it would be impossible to overstate the magnitude of this nation's energy problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.301" offset="6294373">It's important not only in its own right, but also because of its effect on inflation, the environment, interstate trade and national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.859" offset="6340662">Our opponents have said that it's in the future, and that it's not something that Congress has to deal with yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.981" offset="6373159">I submit that Congress is to be praised, rather than its statute to be held unconstitutional simply because it anticipated and dealt with the problem before we have, once again, such severe problems as we have had in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.303" offset="6434390">The other side of the balance scale is the adverse effect on state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.316" offset="6458422">I submit that for reasons discussed, these are minimal as to Titles I and III; they require only consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.360" offset="6490605">And as to Section 210, since they can be satisfied by a means that has already been validated by this Court in Testa v. Katt, the comparative balance between state and federal interests clearly favors the constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.244" offset="6554135">And finally, this statute is a proper exercise of Congress' national security powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.882" offset="6576705">The linkage between national security on the one hand, and on the other, the dependence on foreign oil in this case and controlling the price of timber sales involved in Case v. Bowles greatly favors the balance in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.361" offset="6646608">The courts of appeals that have dealt with this issue have uniformly upheld congressional statutes enacted in the interest of national security when attacked on Tenth Amendment grounds.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="3484.883" offset="14072698">Two brief matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.570" offset="14075415">First of all, the FERC regulations were promulgated in February of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.319" offset="14098507">Second, and finally, aside from whatever this Court's decision in National League of Cities and Towns v. Usery, may mean in another context, we simply submit that it should not apply whereas here, you have a true example of cooperative Federalism, where Congress is sharing some of its authority with the states in the interest of both federal and state government and out of plea in response to the request of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.412" offset="14246883">And that, at a minimum, must be what this Court's articulation of a balancing test, both in National League of Cities and Towns and also in Hodel, means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.408" offset="14286798">With regard to Titles I and III, Congress clearly could have set the rates if it had chosen to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.953" offset="14308950">What an anomaly it would be if the Tenth Amendment were to become the vehicle for preventing Congress from responding to state pleas for flexibility and experimentation in the perceived interest of both federal and state governments to give states a larger role in that particular governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.523" offset="14391288">With regard to Section 210, Mr. Alston distinguished Testa v. Katt on the ground that no state functions were displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.003" offset="14425247">Really, they haven't been here, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.144" offset="14429740">The states are given several options as to what they can do, but they are not required to bring into existence any new entity of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.812" offset="14464430">They are not required to have any of their existing public service commissions perform any functions that they are not now performing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.605" offset="14495568">The obligation imposed by Section 210 and the implementing regulations can be performed by simply entertaining disputes before appropriate adjudicatory entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.490" offset="14559098">And that does not mean that any new entity must be brought into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.661" offset="14575817">That point is made, for example, with respect to Nebraska, which has no public utility commission with authority to set rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.283" offset="14606328">In Nebraska, presumably, that responsibility can be performed simply by entertaining that kind of suit before the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.124" offset="14633704">And that, at a very minimum, is what Testa v. Katt says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.137" offset="14649691">And in that respect, Testa v. Katt is indistinguishable, that states are simply required to observe a federal rule of decision that is prescribed by the federal government but to be observed in state proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3650.691" offset="14735999">And clearly, Mr. Chief Justice, if the federal government has the authority under the Spending Clause to impose that kind of an obligation on the states, then clearly, under its--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3662.874" offset="14784692">Would that be purely under the Spending Clause, or under the Commerce Clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="3666.544" offset="14799320">--Well, the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.528" offset="14807261">Then clearly, if you take into account the kind of balancing and recognition of the comparative weights of federal and state interests, particularly where in many instances, in the view of many states in this case, they are identical, then Congress certainly, in light of that balancing approach, should have that kind of flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.551" offset="14883435">And if it has that kind of power under the Taxing and Spending and the Commerce Clauses over a 55 mile an hour speed limit, then clearly, under its powers over national security it should have the flexibility to deal in as cooperative Federalism approach as it has in 1978.</text>

            <text syncTime="3750.103" offset="15133583">Since most of the proceedings are going to be in state court, it is not the Article III case or controversy requirement that will apply, but rather, state rules.</text>
