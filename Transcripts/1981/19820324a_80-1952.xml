            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="16.026" offset="203544">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.009" offset="215456">New York's alleged involvement in medical decisions about nursing home care for Medicaid patients was found below to constitute state action in two kinds of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.551" offset="257670">A brief review of the kinds of circumstances in which state action was found to be present is necessary because that inquiry determines the additional question petitioners raise in this case; that is, the district court's jurisdiction under Article III to decide the claims that are now before you, and also, it aids the inquiry, the state action inquiry, in the event the court reaches that inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.698" offset="350248">The first circumstance in which state action was found to be present occurs when a patient's outside physician, or a physician on the staff of a nursing home, decides to decrease or increase the level of the patient's care because his condition has become worse or because it has become better.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.940" offset="419211">In our brief, we refer to the decision of the nursing home staff physician as a nursing home decision or transfer, and we refer to the decision of the outside physician as the decision of a private physician, albeit both of those decisions are private action within the constraints of the court of appeals' decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.448" offset="497265">The second circumstance in which state action was found to be present occurs when a utilization review committee or a physician member of that committee decides to increase a patient's level of care because his condition has become worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.348" offset="556824">Parenthetically, it should be noted that utilization review is a federally-required peer review system, that a utilization review decision about a change in care for a patient who is already in a nursing home is made during a portion of that process called continued stay review, and the continued stay review is addressed to whether or not the patient needs nursing home care at all, and if he does, what kind of care he needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.899" offset="679077">Two further points with respect to utilization review, and that is the utilization review physician's decision to change a level of care is final once made if it is not opposed by the patient's own physician, and that requirement is specific to the federal regulations which are found at 42 CFR 556.336, and 442 CFR 556.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.511" offset="801435">436, and the state regulations track the federal regulations in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.901" offset="823064">In addition, if the utilization review physician decides that the patient needs this upward change in level of care and his decision is opposed by the patient's private physician, if two utilization review physicians agree, then the decision of the utilization review committee becomes final, again, under the regulations that I just called to your attention.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="194.905" offset="919090">How much time do these physicians spend in this process as compared with the time they spend taking care of the patients?</text>

            <text syncTime="201.247" offset="944377">Well, Your Honor, if you look at 42 CFR 456.330 following which describes these various utilization review procedures in quite tedious detail, I think you would have to conclude that he spends a great deal of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.318" offset="1024730">However, I can't, in fact, give you an exact estimate, but certainly we have no indication that the physicians who serve on these committees are not attending to the care of their patients, at least in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.078" offset="1067779">Petitioners contend that the district court should never have reached the transfers that are at issue and that I just described with respect... in the circumstances I just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.449" offset="1109262">And that is because there was no plaintiff and no class representative before the district court who could have raised the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.837" offset="1138832">Not only was there no one who had such a transfer or was threatened with such a transfer, there certainly was no one who had the reality or the prospect of the kind of distinct and palpable injury that Article III requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.023" offset="1627531">When it came time to consider the preparation of the petition for certiorari in this case, and Mrs. Siegel was then solicitor general of the state of New York... she is no longer... and we, myself and the assistants who aided me, reviewed the record in this case which was quite lengthy, we came to the conclusion that the Article III question was fairly presented by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.811" offset="1714676">We also observed that it had not been raised before and we had detailed conversations with Mrs. Siegel as to whether or not we should call it to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.557" offset="1749680">The conclusion of those conversations was that we could not, consistent with the standards of our practice, fail to call them to your attention, lest this Court reach the merits of the case involving constitutional rulings, which was not adequately presented in terms of Article III.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="judith_a_gordon" startTime="445.430" stopTime="574.956">
            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="445.430" offset="1921148">That is a very interesting point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.414" offset="1933059">At page 14 of our main brief we describe briefly what the state policies were before the judgment on review came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.160" offset="1972034">One of the state policies with respect to URC transfers to higher levels of care, which you just called to my attention, was that those transfers would be, in effect, advisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.201" offset="2024279">In other words, the state of New York, the Medicaid authorities, would not change the level of benefits based on a URC decision, it would simply await what the doctor did, what the URC did.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.898" offset="2079032">If the patiently ultimately got transferred by virtue of that URC decision, then it would adjust the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.335" offset="2100765">If it did not, if the patient did not get transferred, they would leave the benefits intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.645" offset="2121977">Now, aside from substantial equity problems that were involved in that policy which was, of course, superseded by this judgment; namely, there were people in nursing homes who in fact needed a much more intensive level of care and were not receiving it, that being one of the equities on a change of policy side.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.151" offset="2200031">The federal government came along and advised us that although they had required hearings on URC transfers to lower levels of care, that our FFP, our federal financial participation, was in serious jeopardy if we avoided hearings on higher levels of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.190" offset="2288220">And the letters with respect to that appear in the second supplement to the Joint Appendix, which includes some letters referred to in petitioner's brief... pardon me, respondents' brief... at page 4, note 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.059" offset="2343704">In other words, respondents refer to a letter by Commissioner Blum to the federal authorities saying can't we please give hearings on URC transfers to higher levels of care now, since you already told us there is a program requirement... not as a constitutional requirement... that we have to give them on transfers to lower levels of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.394" offset="2424997">That is the first letter in the second supplement to the Joint Appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.861" offset="2450911">The answer from the federal government was that they did not perceive that to be an effective way of utilization review, at least for transfers to higher levels of care.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.514" offset="2485497">You have, I think, taken the position in your brief that private transfer decisions for patients in nursing homes are medical decisions unaffected by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.976" offset="2551325">Now, what about a decision by the nursing home itself to transfer, when made by someone other than a physician?</text>
            <text syncTime="611.801" offset="2586643">Is that a medical decision?</text>

            <text syncTime="613.346" offset="2592808">Well, it can be or it cannot be depending on how... what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.689" offset="2618199">And as I indicated, we do not have any plaintiffs who present the facts that would support those kinds of conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.638" offset="2649964">However, when we viewed this judgment, we thought of it as pertaining really only to medical decisions; decisions by a nursing home's medical director and therefore medically predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.741" offset="2710359">There is a possible other reading which plaintiff... which respondents point out essentially at page 22 of their brief and throughout their brief, that a nursing home, not through its medical director but through its administrator, might want to discharge somebody because he is a bad patient, or for some other non-medical reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.888" offset="2807012">Now, those discharges, in fact, present this case in microcosm, because those kinds of discharges are covered by something called the patient's bill of rights, which is codified in federal regulations and codified in state regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.693" offset="2870228">And what that bill of rights says is, if you were transferred by your nursing home,... presumably a human being who has made a decision who is affiliated with the nursing home.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.018" offset="2911502">If you were transferred for non-medical reasons, for non-payment, for your own welfare, you have a right to challenge that nursing home decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.233" offset="2948387">You do not have a right to bring a Medicaid reimbursement claim against the state in a fair hearing to get money; that does not do you any good.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.103" offset="2983809">You have a right to bring a private action against the nursing home.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.773" offset="3006483">And we suggest to you that the kinds of medical decisions that are at issue in this case, made as they are by these private URC's, the facility medical director, the staff physician, your outside physician, present exactly the same kind of private transactions as the purely... as respondents call them... the purely non-medical needs decisions, and that the remedy for these, if there is to be a remedy, is against the people who made the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.231" offset="3128318">Not in a request to the state to pay you money for a service that an individual in the private sector has already refused to provide you.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.438" offset="3229151">The state prescribes the use of what respondents have called and what are, in fact, a DMS-1 form and a DMS-9 form.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.413" offset="3317131">Those forms can be found... they are not referenced in respondents' briefs, but they can be found in Appendix C1 to Volume C of Title x of the New York Code Rules and Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.001" offset="3383482">Their are displayed there in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.485" offset="3389334">Now, the state has prescribed those forms, and what those forms consist of are, one, a standard sheet which assigns... in fact, the sheet is called New York State Numerical Standards Master Sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.541" offset="3449624">That is the DMS-9 form.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.633" offset="3461954">And the DMS-1 form is called the New York State Long-Term Care Placement form.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.958" offset="3487241">And what those forms do is describe certain kinds of medical conditions, certain kinds of patient conditions... in other words, self-care in dressing, needs help, needs total help... and certain other kinds of conditions such as needs restraints, requires... is assaultive.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.858" offset="3562891">And the numerical standards assign certain weights to these depending on when the condition occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.574" offset="3585774">Now, those two forms used in combination... and they are used throughout this proceed including with respect to these medical decision... create what are called predictor scores.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.447" offset="3757242">The specific regulations which control the use of these forms; namely, 10 New York Code Rules and Regulations, Section 415.1A(2) and Section 420.1B, state in terms that all the physician who gets this form has to do to say that his patient needs another kind of care that is not consistent with the predictor score, is say so.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.534" offset="3977611">--I would just like to point out one other factor with respect to the DMS-1 forms because in the entire array of federal and state laws which the respondents bring to bear on their argument... which is not the court of appeals' argument... that state action is somehow found in these transfers because the state forces them, the only point that needs clarification is, in fact, the use of these DMS-1 forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.367" offset="4092863">Justice O'Connor, if I just might finish, the respondents also say that somehow, even if we use these forms and they are not specifically controlled by the state, their results are not specifically controlled by the state, that we at some point review them, and we determine whether they are correctly drawn or incorrectly drawn, and disapprove or approve the physician choices that appear on those forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.857" offset="4182829">That is an absolutely incorrect statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.449" offset="4193278">The portion of the record that the respondents cite for that point is an affidavit by Donald Davidoff, which is document 18 of the record on appeal, and the affidavit simply does not say that, and that is not in fact what we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.381" offset="4256912">We leave the forms as we find them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.412" offset="4269138">We do collect them, we use them for statistical purposes, and it is possible that in the course of receiving those forms or in the course of another procedure that the respondents called to your attention which are called periodic medical reviews and independent professional reviews which are audits essentially of the quality of care offered in nursing homes, it is possible that in the course of any of this regulatory complex that the state might, indeed, find a nursing home patient who is inappropriately placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.881" offset="4406960">That did not happen in this case, certainly not on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.834" offset="4418767">But if the state were to find that patient and it were to direct that patient's removal from a nursing home, well then, certainly, we would not be here today arguing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.280" offset="4464534">That would be a state initiated transfer, and New York at least would not come before this Court and claim that state action was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.762" offset="4502463">But the kinds of transfers that were decided below are all medically initiated for reasons determined by private parties, and have nothing whatsoever to do with the state's control, intervention or forcing of any of the decisions at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.350" offset="4568814">Returning just briefly to the standing point, Your Honor, respondents make essentially two arguments against the petition... the petitioner's claim that they lack standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.281" offset="4624612">The first is... depends on their acknowledge that indeed, in January of 1978, the district court did enjoin the URC transfers to lower levels of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.589" offset="4673827">But they turn around and they say that notwithstanding that injunction, the same individuals... presumably the respondents and the intervenors... were subject to the same kind of risk, albeit the injunction was enforced, because the nursing home was going to adopt that URC decision as its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.409" offset="4749059">It was going to simply say oh, well, URC, you are enjoined; now we are going to enforce that... we are going to make the same choice and disregard the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.889" offset="4783019">Well, the argument omits to point out that in the very order that enjoined the URC's... to wit: the January 5, 1978 injunction... the nursing homes themselves were also enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.619" offset="4833905">And therefore, the argument assumes that the nursing homes would have entered into some kind of subterfuge or circumvention of the order to make the same choice and say it was their own and not a URC order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.239" offset="4884374">The record is completely barren of any evidence which even suggests that the nursing home sought to circumvent the order in this regard, and indeed, it is barren of any evidence that the nursing home ever threatened or transferred any of the named respondents in any way whatsoever once the order was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.745" offset="4970369">Moreover, even if you accept the logic of the argument, it still fails because the injunction upon which it relies; namely, URC transfers to lower levels of care, is not at all coextensive with the claims that the respondents sought to put before the court; namely, including those claims to higher levels of care and to... and physician transfers to lower levels of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.001" offset="5079456">A second argument that respondents make with respect to our claim that they lack standing relies on the speculation that there must be some other member of this class, even if it is not the named respondents and intervenors, who in fact had a physician transfer to a higher level of care, or a URC transfer to a higher level of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.321" offset="5160749">I suggest to the Court that that argument is impossible because the laws established that the claims of class members can never be broader than the claims of class representatives, and the only class representatives before the court below were indeed the named respondents and the intervenors who only had the URC transfers to lower levels of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.938" offset="5243192">Respondents also called to your attention two letters... actually, three letters; two are identical and one is slightly different... in support of their claim that some member of the class had these transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.948" offset="5291257">The letters are dated a year and a year and a half after the district court entered the last partial final judgment in this case, and they are appended to their brief in opposition to certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.567" offset="5353742">And obviously, a transfer, even assuming the person who was receiving it was aggrieved, and these letters do not suggest that they were, a transfer happening to somebody a year or a year and a half after the district court determined the claims that are at issue, cannot serve to place those claims before the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.673" offset="5534091">In other words, they were telling the nursing home liaison how to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.938" offset="5547152">And the patient is identified in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.795" offset="5562617">It is not suggested for a moment that any of the identified patients... or either of the identified patients... thought that they should have a hearing right on any of the transfers that are in issue, or even that they had any opinion at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.428" offset="9665200">Now, the court resolved below the question of simply terminating the care altogether or assigning the patient to a lower level of care.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.811" offset="9898734">Your Honor, let me explain what happened below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.059" offset="9915662">There was a consent judgment; that consent judgment resolved the controversy between plaintiffs and defendants about implementation of utilization review committee determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.445" offset="9965190">Ms. Gordon has explained utilization review committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.755" offset="9978460">Those determinations were to discharge a patient, transfer him to a lower level of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.331" offset="10004792">We settled that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.144" offset="10008031">The state said we are not going to enforce those determinations; they are too traumatic, they are too harmful to the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.048" offset="10031645">Now, what that left was the following: it left the facilities themselves capable... not only capable but required, as I have explained... to move those patients if they do not need that level of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.010" offset="10095489">The state never maintained these people did not need that level of care, the state never retreated from its support of the so called DMS-1 instrument as a way of assessing that level of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.880" offset="10142927">When the utilization review committee route to moving patients was closed, then these plaintiffs came under the threat of the state law that I described, that facilities must promptly move them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.467" offset="10201337">Before that time, the facilities could rely upon the utilization review process as a way of moving in appropriately placed patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.184" offset="10232161">Now, both parties in the lower court understood full well that the threat that the facilities themselves would move these patients crystallized with the entry of the consent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.742" offset="10282421">With the entry of the consent judgment, which the state resisted up to the last minute, the utilization review route was suddenly closed shut as a way to move these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.984" offset="10335397">Each one of these plaintiffs, though, had been assessed against the state's DMS-1 instrument and had been found by that evaluation which the plaintiffs challenged, not to need that level of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.574" offset="10381686">Now, with a consent judgment entered, the only way that the facilities could comply with the requirement of state law that they must promptly without a hearing move inappropriately-placed patients was to move them themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.381" offset="10440932">The utilization review route was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.005" offset="10455456">The plaintiffs moved quickly when that threat existed to have the issue adjudicated simply because any delay in the resolution of that question obviously carried with it the serious risk that these transfers would be accomplished--</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.420" offset="14093164">And we submit that it is significant here when the class was defined without objection, without appeal by the defendants to include all Medicaid patients in nursing facilities in New York state, and given this allegation that class members were transferred improperly, not controverted by the defendants, standing was never interposed as a basis for objection below, that that class certification can bridge the gap between the allegations of the named plaintiffs and the allegations, unrefuted, unobjected to by the defendants concerning class members, when there was no objection taken to the certification of the class, no appeal taken in the statement of controverted issues that the proposition, that allegation about class members was not contested.</text>
