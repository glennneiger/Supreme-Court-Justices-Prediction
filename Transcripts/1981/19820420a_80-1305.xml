            <text syncTime="12.991" offset="182969">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is whether the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has standing as parens patriae to sue 32 individual apple growers from the Commonwealth of Virginia for allegedly breaching the employment contracts and allegedly violating the federal statutory and regulatory rights of a small number of Puerto Rican workers during the 1978 apple harvest.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.991" offset="294982">I am going to get into these points in more detail later, but we think there are three major reasons why the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico lacks parens patriae standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.966" offset="342839">First, the injuries alleged did not affect the general population of Puerto Rico in a substantial way.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.972" offset="374917">Secondly, we believe that Puerto Rico in affect is attempting to litigate the personal claims of a small group of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.427" offset="412742">Thirdly, we believe that the Puerto Rican workers allegedly aggrieved have adequate remedies and have clearly demonstrated their ability to litigate the issues themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.896" offset="730600">We have opposed it, and we strenuously oppose it because we don't think it is class action material.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.300" offset="752230">Basically, you have a number of individual workers who have claims against individual growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.454" offset="780756">A particular Puerto Rican worker, if he accepted a job offer, accepted the job offer of one grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.743" offset="813983">If he was discriminated against, he was discriminated against by that one grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.864" offset="830493">He does not have a grievance against any other growers, and yet what they have attempted to do in this case and what they have attempted, the individual Puerto Ricans have attempted to do in these purported class actions is to lump together into one case something which really shouldn't be brought as one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.175" offset="907711">The facts in the case, in this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.929" offset="934669">Since the case was decided on the basis of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b), we must accept as true all the material allegations of fact in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.922" offset="986705">The facts are basically these.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.941" offset="998721">There are 32 Virginia apple growers who were sued in the district court and are Petitioners in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.461" offset="1028814">Each Virginia grower in the spring of 1978... I think the complaint says April 28th, 1978... filed individual applications to the United States Department of Labor for permission to bring in temporary foreign workers under the H2 program.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.606" offset="1101435">The H2 program was created pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, and it provides for the admission of temporary foreign workers into this country when not enough qualified U.S. workers are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.101" offset="1163397">There are very detailed procedures set out in the regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor at 20 CFR Part 655.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.573" offset="1205298">The H2 program is administered jointly by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.245" offset="1239988">The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its Department of Labor plays only a very peripheral role in the administration of this program, and its role is severely circumscribed by these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.155" offset="1291606">For reasons that are set forth in greater detail in the brief, the clearance order or the job offers of these individual Virginia growers, even though they were filed as early as April of 1978, were not sent to Puerto Rico until early August of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.133" offset="1371541">This was less than two weeks before the growers were due to be certified as to their needs to bring in temporary foreign workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.406" offset="1404560">This... The resulting last minute recruitment by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico allegedly produced names of enough Puerto Rican workers to fill all the jobs of all the 32 Virginia growers, a total of 787 jobs for all 32 growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.003" offset="1487002">However, only... when the apple harvest arrived, only 420 of the Puerto Ricans actually arrived in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.377" offset="1532455">The remainder never left the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.345" offset="1548338">The United States Department of Labor in effect ordered the cancellation of the remaining flights, allegedly because</text>
            <text syncTime="362.185" offset="1579685">"Certain growers had refused to employ individuals referred by Puerto Rico. "</text>
            <text syncTime="367.322" offset="1600269">Of the 420 Puerto Ricans who did arrive at the orchards, allegedly fewer than 30 had employment three weeks later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.293" offset="6136171">The first category is an alleged failure to provide employment to Puerto Ricans, and here, however, we have two subcategories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.333" offset="6180370">With respect to ten growers, the alleged failure to provide employment is based on the fact that their Puerto Rican workers never left the Island of Puerto Rico as a result of the cancellation of their flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.158" offset="6231570">In fact, this is the only allegation in the complaint against four of the Virginia growers named in this complaint, the fact that their workers never left Puerto Rico because the United States Department of Labor cancelled their flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.549" offset="6277232">Eight other growers allegedly denied employment to Puerto Ricans who showed up at their orchards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.620" offset="6305445">With respect to these eight, at least seven of them also allegedly did other things to their workers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.355" offset="9484442">And they allege that the minority unemployment in the State of Georgia is 25,000 people, and that they want jobs in New York in hotels and restaurants, and that those jobs are now held two-thirds by Puerto Ricans, and that there is a plan and scheme to hire Puerto Ricans for these positions in New York, and that therefore the unemployed of Georgia are being denied something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.415" offset="9640654">Now, laying aside all the merits, does Georgia have parens patriae standing to bring that suit?</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.553" offset="11733167">Thereafter, there were too many workers in the orchards, and the massive firings and the failure to hire at the orchard gates ensued in the Virginia orchards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.813" offset="11790218">Mr. Bacas, opposing counsel, says that the individuals can sue on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.883" offset="11814565">There is no need for this parens patriae action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.033" offset="11823133">He has a problem, however, because we have people who were left at the gates in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.905" offset="11850614">When the growers were not hiring these people in the orchards, the U.S. Secretary of Labor advised Secretary Quiros that he could not send up any more, he should not send up any more, and so these workers who were ready to go up to Virginia were cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.138" offset="11951551">Where is the remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.236" offset="11931907">Is it breach of contract for those workers who were left at the airport?</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.806" offset="11958238">Is it breach of contract for those workers who didn't come up in 1979?</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.458" offset="11976837">They have no remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.460" offset="11980808">There is no remedy under the employment service complaint system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.964" offset="12006826">That is futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.648" offset="12009542">There is no remedy in Puerto Rico, we believe, that is a secure remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.517" offset="12029082">In Maryland versus Louisiana, just last term, the question was whether or not this first use tax, 7 cents per MCF on gas coming into Louisiana, would that give rise to a parens patriae claim on the part of eight states who sued in the original jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.279" offset="12108076">The Court held that there was parens patriae jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.000" offset="12130960">It involved many people; no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.352" offset="12136393">It was 7 cents per MCF.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.454" offset="12144752">But there were claim... there were forums available in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.673" offset="12161680">There was a tax refund suit filed by a natural gas carrier, but the Court in a footnote held that because there was no injunction, preliminary injunction available prior to decision on the merits, that was an imperfect forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.650" offset="12237539">Well, we have a number of imperfect fora in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.454" offset="12252795">The administrative forum is certainly imperfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.240" offset="12267946">Suits by individuals either in Puerto Rico or in Virginia, a very imperfect form, given the nature of these immigrant laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.698" offset="12309742">We have the class action suit up in New York involving New York growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.285" offset="12336178">That comes fairly close to getting the kind of thing, the kind of relief that we are seeking, except that there is no class action suit against the Virginia growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.659" offset="12381631">We finally have the statement of the Department of Labor that the parens patriae action of the Commonwealth does not infringe any U.S. interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.585" offset="12441294">It is consistent with the interests of the Department of Labor, because it is consistent with the strong policy preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.423" offset="12464700">If that policy preference is to be established, we can send workers up to Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.327" offset="12492285">If it is not, we cannot, and this suit, we submit, is the only effective vehicle to establish in the Western District of Virginia the strong preference of Congress that U.S. workers be preferred over aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.419" offset="12552680">I submit that the decision of the Fourth Circuit along with the decision of the Second Circuit on these issues should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.227" offset="12595939">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I just have a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.881" offset="12618509">First, I would like to emphasize that both the district court and the court of appeals in this case agreed on the proper test to apply in determining parens patriae standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.487" offset="12656961">Both courts said, you look at the size of the segment of the population affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.373" offset="12676501">You look at the magnitude of the harm, and you look at the ability of those injured to rectify the alleged wrongs on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.561" offset="12709206">The disagreement between the court of appeals and the district court was not on what test to apply, but how that test applied to these particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.500" offset="12744942">We agree with Justice Marshal that 787 workers, which are the only workers that are covered by this particular complaint, despite insinuations by counsel to the contrary, the only growers involved in this case are the Virginia apple growers, 32 Virginia apple growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.997" offset="12826966">The only Puerto Ricans involved are the 787 who allegedly accepted those jobs in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.736" offset="12853925">That 787 number constitutes 3/100ths of 1 percent of the 1970 population of Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.163" offset="13023616">That didn't involve many people either who were flooded out.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas J. Bacas</label>
            <text syncTime="3225.848" offset="13034378">I believe, if... there have been many parens patriae suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.685" offset="13057680">I believe that is probably one of the ones involving diversion of water or some other injury to the land, and also a dispute between actions in one state that have an immediate effect in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.727" offset="13101879">I would submit that those are substantially different from this case, where the alleged quasi-sovereign interest turns on the harm to the general economy of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.783" offset="13142107">If the parens patriae test could be satisfied in this case, it could be satisfied in virtually any case, and I don't believe the parens patriae test has been broadened that much over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.156" offset="13191636">Mr. Lenzini made a reference to the fact that there are upwards of five to 7,000 jobs in which he can place Puerto Rican workers, but what he is talking about, he is talking about the entire east coast apple harvest, and I want to stress, we have states which aren't even involved in the 1978 program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.587" offset="13273347">The complaint alleges that Puerto Rican workers were sent to only four states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.224" offset="13291841">They were sent to Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.826" offset="13302290">He leaves out the six New England states, which evidently received no Puerto Rican workers in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.395" offset="13324547">So when he talks about a larger number, he is not talking about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.465" offset="13344818">In this case, we are talking about 787 Puerto Rican workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.369" offset="13368432">We are talking about 32 Virginia apple growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.404" offset="13380553">Obviously, a number of you have pointed out, the standing cannot turn on the unemployment rate in Puerto Rico, or in any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.677" offset="13417647">I would note that the unemployment figures are cited in the... Page 8 of the amicus curiae brief of the State of New York, and they show that the unemployment rate was 19.9 in 1977, the year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.436" offset="13476684">In 1978, it was 18.1 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.119" offset="13487446">In 1979, the year after, it was 17 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.071" offset="13499254">I don't know how a constitutional concept of standing can turn on such a fluctuating standard of unemployment rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.908" offset="13522659">The other point I want to make, the last point, is that there is no allegation of a boycott in the complaint, and there is no allegation of conspiracy in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.985" offset="13578875">The complaint merely alleges that certain individual Puerto Ricans have individual grievances against individual growers.</text>
