            <text syncTime="66.395" offset="396008">This case arises out of a confrontation that occurred in a Denver, Colorado, city park between three officers of the Denver police department and the father of the Respondents and a companion of that father.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.964" offset="494332">As I read the State Supreme Court's opinion, the trial court had dismissed the 1983 action on a motion for summary dismissal on the ground that the remedy was exclusively under state law for death by a wrongful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.174" offset="575103">Now, on that basis the State Supreme Court reversed the trial court and said, no, you should not have had summary judgment sending it back, and therefore the case is now back where it started and would go to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.668" offset="945101">We have only raised the finding of the Colorado Supreme Court insofar as it recognized a personal constitutional right in the child to a continuing family relationship, which would afford that child a claim pursuant to Section 1983 for deprivation of that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="832.867" offset="3461947">I might point out that what we would submit has been considerable confusion concerning the construing the state death statutes, the wrongful death statute and the survivor statute, with claims under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.969" offset="3550346">We would submit particularly in this instance that the state death statutes cannot bear any relevance as to whether or not a 1983 claim can be asserted in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.979" offset="3598411">Following the rationale of the Colorado Supreme Court, it is consistent to state that it does not require death of the father in this case to give rise to the 1983 claim in terms of affecting this family relationship between the parent and child.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.535" offset="3668628">Instead, false imprisonment could give rise and would be the same type of intrusion in the family relationship which, according to the Colorado Supreme Court's rationale, would afford the basis for the child to assert a personal 1983 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.760" offset="3745532">And clearly, if the father is not dead and has simply been removed from that family relationship, albeit for life, that family relationship with the child is affected almost to the same degree as if the father was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.317" offset="3815750">Yet clearly, with the father not being dead the death statutes, the wrongful death statute and the survival statute of Colorado, would not apply in any instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.811" offset="3853679">Therefore, any discussion, we submit, that the remedies provided under the state death statutes can somehow relate to claims under 1983 has no basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.760" offset="3905506">The finding of the Colorado Supreme Court is premised, as was mentioned, on a personal liberty interest in the continuing family relationship with that father.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.596" offset="3984814">We submit that this is an unprecedented finding, that this Court nor any other appellate court has ever so recognized such a personal constitutional interest in a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.042" offset="4046568">There has been one court that decided the issue on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.650" offset="4069033">The Seventh Circuit affirmed without comment an opinion of the Illinois District Court in Evain v. Conlisk that found that no such right exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.364" offset="4111874">The Colorado court, we submit erroneously, deduced from this Court's finding in Stanley versus Illinois that this Court recognized a constitutionally protected right between the relationship of the father toward the child, and therefore that reciprocal right of the child to the parent must also exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.073" offset="4210721">But Petitioners further submit that that was an erroneous finding, was a misinterpretation of Stanley, and even if it was a correct interpretation of Stanley that such a... there was a constitutionally protected right of the father toward the child, one cannot state that this reciprocal right between... of the child to the parent ipso facto exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.328" offset="4315733">That is a right of a different kind, of a different nature, and whether or not this right exists must be determined on the basis of the principles set forth by this Court in the abortion case of Roe v. Wade as to whether it is a constitutional liberty interest that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.084" offset="4406744">It must be fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and what has normally been found to be fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty normally involves those choices, freedom of choices or freedom of decisions, such as a parent to have a child or not to have a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.138" offset="4502979">And with respect to the child's relationship with the parent, this does not involve a freedom of choice or a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.556" offset="4540700">It is a happenstance, of course, which the child has no control over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.914" offset="4558150">And we have found this carried through in lawsuits that children have sought to bring for wrongful life, where there was found to be no basis in fact because the child doesn't have any choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.019" offset="4614574">So therefore, even if this Court were to recognize a personal liberty interest and protection of the parent with respect to the protection of his relationship with this child, that reciprocal constitutional right in the child would not exist with respect to his continuing family relationship with his parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.508" offset="4704435">I don't think one needs to use one's imagination to any great degree to recognize the profound ramifications, not only upon the liability of public entities, but on the federal judiciary itself, because if this concept of continuing family relationship is afforded constitutional protection we submit that even the slightest state intrusion in this family relationship would give rise not only to one 1983 claim, but every member of that family relationship would be afforded each a personal 1983 claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.722" offset="5853301">This Court has before it in a 1983 context a state statute which basically makes it more profitable for police officers to kill than to wound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.779" offset="5901575">It's an unusual statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.638" offset="5908994">It's a four-part survival and wrongful death statute, and three parts of it are set forth in our brief to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.837" offset="5945774">There's an additional portion which is cited to the Court in both briefs, but which was left out, I think through inadvertence, and that's the first part of what we call the survivorship claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.973" offset="5994362">But when you read these four statutes you'll see that they're very complicated, they're very confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.831" offset="6009722">Basically, Colorado law on the subject of wrongful death and on the subject of survivorship is that very little survives, and as regards wrongful death damages are limited to $45,000 unless a dependent, mother or father, child or spouse, is left living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.321" offset="6111704">There's also what we call the net pecuniary loss rule, which translated means you're only worth what you can earn.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore S. Halaby</label>
            <text syncTime="3257.272" offset="13159541">I'd like to clear up a certain amount of confusion with respect to the wrongful death and survival remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.082" offset="13186812">I think it's clear to the Justices in reading other decisions that often other courts have used wrongful death and survival interchangeably in describing their particular state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.169" offset="13247103">In Colorado there are two separate statutes, and therefore in Colorado, because there is a survivorship statute that allows vindication of the decedent's deprivation to survive his death, wrongful death is an entirely different animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.787" offset="13317634">And we Submit that by definition there cannot be a wrongful death 1983 claim, because by the nature of that statute under wrongful death you'd be suing for deprivation of another's civil rights, not your own personal civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.778" offset="13393598">The only way you can sue for deprivation of the decedent's civil rights is pursuant to the survivor statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.650" offset="13417003">And therefore when Respondent speaks of the limitation on the wrongful death statute in this area of a 1983 claim, we submit that there is no such animal, that one cannot assert a 1983 wrongful death claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.443" offset="13468203">Now, we would also submit that what the Respondent is seeking to do is to fashion a right to fit the remedy, as opposed to fashioning a remedy to fit the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.157" offset="13519090">The right must exist irrespective of the remedy, and we must have the right before we can even consider the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.685" offset="13549183">But what Respondent is urging is, because of the remedies available under the survivorship statute and under the wrongful death statute in Colorado, which Respondent believes is not substantial enough, this Court should now fashion a right that would provide for remedies unrestricted by those two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.801" offset="13637686">We submit this is in effect what the Colorado Supreme Court did by recognizing this unprecedented right in the child when the child is a living victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.109" offset="13682930">Of course it would be difficult to argue that wrongful death statute or a survival statute, both of which are premised on death, could affect a living victim, the child, because when the child's rights are deprived with respect to a continuing family relationship that child becomes the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.898" offset="13754088">The father's death is only a factual circumstance to show the intrusion into that family relationship, but it is still the living child that is the victim and therefore logically it would be difficult to argue that the death statutes could limit it in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.361" offset="13819916">But this is what... this we submit has been the approach of the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.640" offset="13841023">The survivorship limitation with respect to the decedent's rights has not been an issue presented by either the Petitioners or the Respondents in the petition phase or in the issues presented by Petitioners in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.148" offset="13923048">Respondents did refer to the wrongful death limitations in their response to our initial petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.284" offset="13947603">But Respondents did not address the limitation with respect to the survivorship statute with respect to the decedent's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.141" offset="13983025">We submit that is not in issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.860" offset="13993892">But if this Court chooses to consider that issue, we believe the answer has already been made by this Court in Robertson v. Wegmann that that is, the survivorship statute, is a permissible limitation on that survivorship claim.</text>
