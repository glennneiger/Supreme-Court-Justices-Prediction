            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="90.724" offset="491477">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="94.509" offset="506524">This is two consolidated cases from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit presenting questions concerning the scope of an implied exclusion from collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act for nonmanagerial employees entrusted by their employers with confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.195" offset="629299">The cases do not present the question that has been before the Court in the past concerning the drawing of the line between labor and management, which has been the subject of much past controversy; but the cases are instead decided on the premise that these are employees who fall on the labor rather than management side of that dividing line.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.214" offset="749358">There is a contention to the contrary in one of the cases that has not yet been reached by the Court of Appeals and would be reached on remand if the court agrees with our contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.236" offset="793453">One of the cases, the Malleable case, involves an assortment of 18 employees, and it's disputed whether they should be included within the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.733" offset="867431">They're described in some detail on pages 10 and 11 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.701" offset="887284">I won't recount all of them at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.970" offset="900450">You'll notice that included among them are four engineers, three draftsmen, and a number of relatively low level employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.861" offset="944022">We describe, for example, one who earns $3.50 an hour and is essentially a shipping clerk and performs such tasks as routing shipments, preparing bills of lading, tracing lost deliveries, and handling damage claim reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.656" offset="1019151">Another at an annual salary of $10,500 handles paperwork relating to shipments to and from the employer's warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.928" offset="1056244">Another at an annual salary of $6,400 handles correspondence and telephone calls concerning difficulties with the company's products and is responsible for issuing credits on defective merchandise, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.389" offset="1126044">Mr. Wallace, isn't Malleable an easier case for the Government than Hendricks?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="255.210" offset="1149345">Well, perhaps so.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.877" offset="1160003">It certainly is true that the Chamber of Commerce, which has filed an amicus brief against us, confined its brief to the Hendricks case and did not take a position with respect to Malleable.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.970" offset="1216427">I'm mentioning this array of employees to give some indication of the scope of the Court of Appeals holdings here, and I'll get to Hendricks in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.396" offset="1270135">But what I want--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="287.046" offset="1276718">Does that suggest that you think there is a substantial difference or a difference between a confidential secretary and a shipping clerk on the other end of the--</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="297.037" offset="1316633">--Not on the facts that were found by the Board in these cases, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.208" offset="1341397">If I may just say one further word about the employees in Malleable, then I'll talk about the personal secretary who was involved in Hendricks.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.082" offset="1388835">I don't think the word "confidential" secretary is the right word there.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.451" offset="1402315">There is no claim in Malleable that any of the employees involved had access to confidential information relating to labor relations in any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.627" offset="1463023">The claim is that they were entrusted with confidences that the employer did not want its potential competitors or competitors to know, or in some instances its customers to know; but not information that the employer would be concerned about a union or fellow employees learning.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.957" offset="1548391">Now, Hendricks involved only one employee as it reaches this Court, a personal secretary to the general manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.532" offset="1590710">And I should say up front that ordinarily someone in that position would be found by the Board to have the labor nexus that I'll be describing in a moment; but the Board is a very fact-specific agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.095" offset="1676914">It made findings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.047" offset="1684751">It goes beyond the labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.747" offset="1691542">It found that this particular general manager had relatively little to do with the setting of labor policies in this small rural electric cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.092" offset="1752878">By and large those matters were handled by the counsel for the cooperative and by the Board of Directors themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.531" offset="1786628">And to the extent the general counsel was involved, the secretary simply did not have a confidential relationship with him with respect to those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.303" offset="1829782">She did not learn of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.172" offset="1837201">She did not have access.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.308" offset="1965724">We don't challenge that here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="462.141" stopTime="467.712">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="462.141" offset="1977113">--This secretary was working for a superior who himself was excluded under Bell.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="467.712" stopTime="905.513">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="467.712" offset="1999369">That is the situation, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.116" offset="2017028">But since virtually all employees work for the general management of the company and people who are managers, that in itself is not dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.256" offset="2061541">The question that the Board has always viewed as the key one is whether there is access to confidential information that is labor related, and the Board has never treated all secretaries to any managerial people as necessarily coming within the Board's definition of confidential employees, although many of them do, if the particular manager has any substantial role in labor relations matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.012" offset="2212528">But let me just say briefly that the Board in both instances found that its labor nexus test was not met, and therefore rejected the claims that these were confidential employees as the Board has developed that doctrine as an implied exception to the bargaining rights under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.580" offset="2326840">And the Court of Appeals in both instances by a 2 to 1 vote denied enforcement of the Board's orders and rejected the labor nexus aspect of the Board's standard in reliance upon a footnote discussion in this Court's Bell Aerospace opinion of several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.730" offset="2427464">Now, the Act itself contains no reference of any kind and never has to confidential employees, but almost from the outset the Board has excluded from bargaining units as a matter of statutory policy employees who have had access to confidential labor relations information.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.916" offset="2548150">There has been an evolution, a refinement of the Board's views on this, but there is a continuum with a few bumps along the way that stretches over some 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.176" offset="2605201">And these cases have usually arisen in just the way the Malleable case has arisen, as a question of defining who is to be included in a bargaining unit, and the contention between the Board and the employer would be about whether the employees with this confidential information should or should not be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.023" offset="2692659">And it has always been developed as a question of excepting them from collective bargaining rights rather than from all possible protection under the Act's broad definition of employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.099" offset="2748979">And another peculiarity of the Hendricks case is that there are no collective bargaining rights involved, no union membership involved of any kind, but an exercise of another kind of protected activity, the signing of a petition, which in the Board's view is a protection that extends to confidential employees within the labor nexus definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.384" offset="2866112">In other words, in the Board's view it really doesn't matter whether the secretary in the Hendricks case falls within the labor nexus definition or not; but they did find that she would not, that she did not have access to confidential labor relations information.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.080" offset="2936852">The basis for the Board's view was early set out, and we have quoted on pages 18 and 19 of our brief in an opinion called Hoover Company a rationale which has really not been deviated from over the years, that even though the Act did not contain any such exclusion, that there is adversity of interest between the union and management in collective bargaining, in the settling of grievances, and consequently in order to implement the statutory policy and make the collective bargaining process work, the Board concluded that management should not be required to handle labor relations matters through employees represented by unions with whom the company has to deal in either their negotiations for collective bargaining or in the disposition of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.259" offset="3217616">But at the same time from the very beginning the Board has in a long series of cases held that access to other kinds of confidential information and the entrusting of other kinds of confidential information to an employee is not a reason for exclusion from the full protections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.410" offset="3326181">We've referred to this on pages 20 and 21 of our brief as the Creamery Package doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.015" offset="3364633">That was one of the earliest cases articulating that point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.586" offset="3382919">It was an even earlier case than the Hoover case.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.621" offset="3395040">It was a 1941 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.323" offset="3405802">And we have collected in Footnote 21 on page 21 of our brief some of the many pre-Taft-Hartley cases in which the Board applied this principle to a large variety of employees entrusted with confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.373" offset="3506008">And we refer on pages 22 and 23 of our brief to two Court of Appeals decisions that upheld this principle, both well before the enactment of Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.282" offset="3565671">The one we quote is a 1945 decision of the Tenth Circuit, and on page 23 we refer to a Third Circuit decision of 1943 likewise upholding this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.898" offset="3656160">And the rationale of it is that there is no inconsistency between the rights of self-organization or collective bargaining rights that are conferred by the National Labor Relations Act and loyal and faithful service to an employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.339" offset="7585916">The usual presumption is that Congress knew what the law was, and I think they can be read consistently with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.624" offset="7607023">But whatever misconception there may have been, still what ultimately was put to the membership of each body was the proposition that the Board is handling this all right, and therefore we have not included anything on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.217" offset="7665433">And Senator Taft's explanation as he introduced the conference report to the Senate... and he was the master strategist... was that this was an area of controversy that we are avoiding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.994" offset="7724470">The obvious stratagem was to keep as much consensus as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.964" offset="7744427">He had his eye on other reforms that he wanted to have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.666" offset="7759160">He knew that there would be a veto, that he had to have a broad consensus to override a veto; and this is why the Senate never reported this out in the first place, after the hearings which revealed the dissension on this issue, and this is part of the explanation that he made in introducing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.865" offset="7847977">If I had time I would read the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.948" offset="7856336">So ultimately, while we have some quarrel, and we've detailed that quarrel, with the Court's characterization of what Congress knew or thought of the Board's position on this subject, we really don't think ultimately it matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.563" offset="7942749">The footnote in Bell Aerospace did not attribute any legal consequence to what it said Congress thought was the state of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.640" offset="8007115">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.763" offset="8035536">First, I would like to comment that I am the general counsel who is referred to in the presentation for the REMC, and I can assure the Court and it was not found by the Board that I was not, as the out-house counsel with an office 25 miles away from the cooperative, in charge of their labor relations, and neither were the directors of the REMC which are farmers elected by the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.163" offset="8149221">In fact, the Court may want to look at a part of the testimony which is included in my brief at page 42 at the top in which the discharged secretary herself testified that the general manager had general responsibility for all the labor relations of all the employees, union employees as well as those in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.497" offset="8258517">The basic issue is a very simple one, and that is whether the Board should be compelled to recognize the written intent of Congress as expressed in the House report that there are certain positions in management for employees loyal to management in positions of trust and confidence, and that these employees should not be subject to influence or control by labor unions or by other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.670" offset="8411177">Or whether is the question shall we recognize the intent of the Board, which is spelled out I think explicitly in its brief in this case in reply brief, that the intent of the Board is to expand its jurisdiction into every area and to include employees under the rights of the Act and the Act's coverage, which was never anticipated by Congress in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.154" offset="8521100">As the Court is aware, the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 was basically passed because of the problems that Congress was having with the jurisdictional questions of the Board from the Wagner Act, and most of the Act or a great deal of it is for the purpose of curtailing that jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2183.390" offset="8862050">I think the only way that the Board can rationalize its conclusion in the Hendricks case can be seen by its response to the issue presented in the cross petition for cert by Hendricks, which issue was that the Seventh Circuit had erroneously concluded that the Board had decided that this secretary was not employed in a labor relations or personnel department capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.027" offset="9000604">And the only response of the Government to that cross appeal, they concede that there was no express decision by the Board, but they say that that impliedly was made because the Board had concluded that she was not a confidential employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.072" offset="9064865">And that basically is the crux of how the Board has over the years since 1957 limited the exclusions; and that is, they have combined two separate and specific exclusions which are contained in both the summary of Senator Taft given on the floor of the Senate when the bill was passed and in the House conference committee report written by Congressman Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.473" offset="9170400">And that is that there were two separate exclusions that both felt existed at that time, and that is, the labor relations personnel employment area exclusion, and separate, the confidential exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.698" offset="9219301">And the Board has over the years co-mingled the two and come up with the confidential labor relations exclusion; and that effectively terminates the effectiveness of both exclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.921" offset="9268202">And that is the only way that one can reach the result in Hendricks especially that this personal secretary to the chief executive officer of the company is included under the Act and has rights as any other employee when he was specifically on the labor negotiating committee, a point that the Board previously in 1957 in the Ethel case found sufficient to exclude a secretary when he was the ultimate resolver of grievances at the company, even though the Court previously in the GM case in 1943 excluded numerous individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.721" offset="10015408">The five separate Circuit Courts of Appeals have also concluded that these are separate exclusions, and perhaps beginning with the 1966 decision in the D.C.

            <text syncTime="2776.851" offset="11235954">Well, I guess back to the confidential part of it is the very interesting item, and Congress in the Hartley report, which is the House report, in discussing this and why they didn't want to just limit it to labor relations said that it shouldn't be up to the good faith of the Board or the unions to decide what information is going to get out of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.883" offset="11332084">Now, the argument on the other side to that is the company has a right to discipline employees who leak out confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.739" offset="11371477">And that is well and good except when one takes into consideration the Board's decision in 1980 in the Texas Instruments case, which luckily was reversed by the First Circuit in 1981, and that decision was employees who are in the process of organizing had the right to distribute on the street corner the confidential information of the company, even though there was a valid plant rule against such disclosure, because we were interfering with their rights, and therefore the company committed an unfair labor practice in dismissing those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.876" offset="11508045">And I think that reflects the notion of Congress in 1947 that we cannot depend upon the Board or upon the unions or the employees to insure that certain types of highly confidential information, which the Board said it was confidential, will not be disclosed to the general public or to competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.705" offset="11591324">The interesting part, I think, about the position of the Government is that they have also argued in this case in my opinion at least two separate standards for the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.049" offset="11656734">In the reply brief at page 13 they indicate that in their opinion secretaries to all persons with managerial functions in the field of labor relations are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.809" offset="11711800">That is not the position that they presented in the initial brief or the position that they held in the Hendricks case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.498" offset="11750566">In the Hendricks case the Board specifically held that she was not excluded because her duties did not involve her in a confidential capacity with her employer's responsibility with respect to labor relations policies as opposed to labor implementation or the grievance procedure in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.328" offset="11837815">There are two separate standards included even in the briefs of the Board in this specific case, and I cannot reconcile the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.886" offset="11880029">But I think it highlights the confusion in this area that has been recognized by the courts in the Retail Clerks case in 1976, again by Chief Justice Burger, where he recognized, and five other Courts of Appeals have made the same decision subsequent to 1966, that prior to 1966 the Board had a separate strand of, for lack of a better term, managerial employees which they had always excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.357" offset="12005939">These employees did not have confidential information, were not involved in labor relations or the formulation of any other policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.677" offset="12035196">But the reason for the exclusion was that they were so aligned or related to management to place them in a potential conflict of interest between labor on the one hand and management on the other; and therefore, the Board had always excluded these types of people, although they didn't give them a categorical name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.840" offset="12115862">And I think that is precisely the type of people, and a couple of the Circuit Courts in discussing this have used the term "confidential employee" as synonymous with those employees aligned and related to management to have a potential conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.588" offset="12198932">So I think that there are two viable exclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.706" offset="12211366">Both should be recognized by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.992" offset="12220457">Both were recognized in the Bell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.277" offset="12229652">The Court specifically said in the Bell case that the confidential... in the dictum that the confidential exclusion was not limited to just confidential and labor relations, because if the Court had ruled that way, then the premise of the Board that managerial limitation exclusion should also be limited by labor relations was also correct, which of course in 1974 by a 5 to 4 decision the Court held that that was not true.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.655" offset="12607173">It is determining the legal standard that should be applied to the confidential exclusion of employees from the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.527" offset="12650641">The Board's position is that the labor nexus test should apply, namely, whether the employee is in a confidential work relationship with a specifically identifiable managerial employee responsible for labor relations policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.723" offset="12715425">The lower court in the Hendricks case rejected that labor nexus test and applied their decision in the Hendricks case to the Malleable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.411" offset="12754191">This controversy is going to be resolved by this Court by the interpretation given to the legislative history of the 1947 amendments to the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.854" offset="12811973">This Court dealt with that history, legislative history in the Bell Aerospace case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.694" offset="12843320">Namely, in Footnote 12, the Court said, in effect, the discussion of confidential employees in both the House and Conference reports unmistakably refers to that term defined in the House bill, which was not limited just to those in labor relations.</text>
