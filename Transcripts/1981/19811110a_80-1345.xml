            <text syncTime="81.552" offset="463095">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents one basic issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.606" offset="487336">The issue is whether a federal court will enforce a contract provision that violates the federal antitrust and labor laws and has been declared by Congress to be unenforceable and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.782" offset="540104">Until this case, no court had ever enforced a contract provision that was alleged to be illegal without resolving the illegality defense on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.304" offset="582109">The courts below nevertheless made that unprecedented decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.475" offset="606873">The basic facts that should be presumed are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.195" offset="621710">Since 1971, the United Mine Workers Union has insisted on including in all of its contracts a provision that would require employers to make payments payable to the UMW health and welfare fund for every ton of coal they purchase from a non U W producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.639" offset="691509">This provision, called the purchase of coal clause, is intended to induce UMW signatories not to purchase coal from and thus to boycott non U M W producers, and to penalize companies like Kaiser Steel that choose to do business with those producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.285" offset="766115">The payments called for by the purchase of coal clause bear no relationship to the amount of labor services provided to a UMW signatory by its union employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.158" offset="805612">The purchase of coal clause was widely understood in the industry to be of doubtful legality, and many UMW signatories, including Kaiser Steel, ignored the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.132" offset="849498">Kaiser Steel complied with all of the lawful provisions in its collective bargaining agreements, including those provisions that required it regularly to make contributions to the UMW health and welfare funds for each ton of coal produced by Kaiser Steel and each hour worked by its UMW employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.564" offset="943225">The reporting requirement was simply an effort to facilitate the unlawful purchase of coal clause and to monitor purchases by UMW signatories of non signatories and was therefore simply an unlawful adjunct to the purchase of coal clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. Douglas Melamed</label>
            <text syncTime="226.362" offset="1042386">--Well, I think it would be... the entering into the agreement and the making an agreement is technically a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.285" offset="1070076">I don't think anyone would have any injury or any damage action as a result of merely executing the contract instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.622" offset="1103408">Kaiser Steel, as I said, refused to comply only with the purchase of coal clause which it believed to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.212" offset="1137785">The health and welfare fund trustees, the Respondents here, for years made no effort to enforce the purchase of coal clause, but in 1978, shortly after the 1974 agreement had expired, Respondents commenced a series of lawsuits seeking to enforce the purchase of coal clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.173" offset="1209674">In this case, Respondents alleged a single cause of action, Kaiser Steel's failure to comply with the purchase of coal clause in the then expired 1974 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.997" offset="1256904">In defense, Kaiser Steel alleged that the purchase of coal clause Respondent sought to enforce violates both Section 80 of the Labor-Management Relations Act and Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and is therefore unenforceable and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.074" offset="1309253">Respondents moved for summary judgment, arguing that they are entitled to enforce the purchase of coal clause even if it is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.597" offset="1343317">The district court granted their motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.547" offset="1351153">A divided court of appeals affirmed, and by a vote of seven to four denied Kaiser Steel's suggestion for rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.070" offset="1389188">The decisions of the lower courts rejecting Kaiser Steel's illegality defense are unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.891" offset="1412489">Until this case, no court had ever enforced a contract clause alleged to be illegal without resolving the illegality defense on the merits, and satisfying itself that the contract was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.199" offset="1461704">Indeed, in case after case, this Court and lower courts have held that federal courts do not enforce illegal contract clauses, and they have so held without regard to the identity of the defendant or the identity of the plaintiff, even where, as here, the plaintiff is seeking accrued monetary obligations and the defendant has received the consideration due him under the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.445" offset="1550729">Mr. Melamed, what do you think the effect of the 1980 amendments was?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_douglas_melamed" startTime="359.266" stopTime="395.808">
            <label>Mr. A. Douglas Melamed</label>
            <text syncTime="359.266" offset="1574030">I don't think the 1981 amendments, Your Honor, have anything to do with the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.437" offset="1598690">The 1981 amendments, to be sure, provide new procedural vehicles and new federal causes of action for pension fund trustees seeking to enforce obligations and contracts for employers to make contributions to pension funds, but they impose those obligations on employers only in the terms of the statute to the extent not inconsistent with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.035" offset="1685103">The statute nowhere says when the making of payments or contracts calling for them would be consistent or inconsistent with law.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="395.808" offset="1720211">Does the legislative history of those amendments indicate that Congress was trying to put into place, if you will, the Benedict case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_douglas_melamed" startTime="406.080" stopTime="521.289">
            <label>Mr. A. Douglas Melamed</label>
            <text syncTime="406.080" offset="1761276">Well, there is no question that some Congressmen spoke and praised the Lewis v. Benedict Coal case, but I don't think that addresses our issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.722" offset="1803803">The Congressmen were, to be sure, concerned that dilatory tactic by employers had obstructed collection actions, but every time they spoke of their concerns, they spoke of defenses raised by employers that were unrelated or extraneous to, in their words, the employer's promise and the plan's entitlement to the contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.849" offset="1884365">Now, as I hope our briefs made clear, it is the law and it ought to be the law that an employer cannot defend an effort to enforce a lawful contract provision on the ground that other contract provisions or other agreements or conduct outside the contract may be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.013" offset="1956985">That is what Lewis v. Benedict Coal, Huge v. Long's Hauling, Kelly v. Kosuga, and the other cases on which Respondents rely are all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.786" offset="1992094">They are all about extraneous, unrelated defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.155" offset="2005573">That is not what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.606" offset="2015395">In this case, Kaiser Steel's defense is that the very promise Respondents seek to enforce is itself illegal, and that the plans are therefore not entitled to the money called for by the purchase of coal clause, and that the plans are therefore not entitled to the money called for by the purchase of coal clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.449" offset="2074745">Therefore, even if we could look beyond the statute which plainly on its terms, I think, leaves unresolved and for determination in accordance with the prior law, the question when contribution payments are lawful and unlawful, or consistent with law and inconsistent with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.626" offset="2135454">Even if we look beyond the statute, and assume that it was intended to embody the remarks of these two or three Congressmen, it wouldn't address the issue here, because nothing that those Congressmen said or the cases to which they referred said that an employer should be obligated to comply with an illegal contract clause or the court should enforce such contract clauses.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="521.289" offset="2222076">Mr. Melamed, I am looking at Page 38A of the appendices to the petition of Kaiser, in which the dissenting opinion quotes from the majority opinion, saying that,</text>
            <text syncTime="535.132" offset="2277455">"The narrow issue on appeal therefore is not whether an illegal contract clause should be enforced, but rather whether Kaiser's proffered defense of illegality should be entertained. "</text>
            <text syncTime="548.107" offset="2329387">What does that mean to you?</text>
            <text syncTime="551.724" offset="2343806">Does that mean that a defendant can set up a defense and a court can simply say, we don't know or care whether it is a good defense or a bad defense, we simply won't hear it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_douglas_melamed" startTime="572.322" stopTime="626.642">
            <label>Mr. A. Douglas Melamed</label>
            <text syncTime="572.322" offset="2426249">I think that is what the majority held in the Court of Appeals, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.959" offset="2444744">It held that we don't care, we are not going to examine the question, we are not going to consider the impact of this contract provision and its lawfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.165" offset="2477553">I don't understand, frankly, why it is that the majority thought there might be a difference between that case and a case where he couldn't look the other way, as it were, and had to acknowledge the unlawfulness of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.289" offset="2530112">Certainly the decided cases don't make that distinction, because in most of them where the illegality defense has been raised and the courts have refused to enforce allegedly illegal contracts, there had been no prior determination of unlawfulness and the courts having the allegation examined the lawfulness of the contract and then made the decision whether to enforce it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.786" offset="2612032">The Court of Appeals, as I say, didn't even do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.655" offset="2623526">It didn't even examine the contract clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.190" offset="2629691">It simply refused to look at it at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.054" offset="3469162">I don't believe so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.656" offset="3483581">Now, apart from the Solicitor General's suggestion that these new amendments to ERISA would bear upon this case, the basic rationale for affirming the court of appeals decision that is embodied in that decision and that Respondents devote the bulk of their attention to is a rationale that turns largely on the court's view of the equities between the litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.056" offset="3581175">The theories that Respondents were third party beneficiaries seeking to enforce a collective bargaining agreement by collecting contributions owed to health and welfare funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.281" offset="3626105">They should be permitted to collect those contributions, the theory goes, because the rest of the terms of the agreement have been performed and Kaiser Steel has received the services of its union employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.506" offset="3675006">This theory is fatally flawed, in our view, both as a matter of equity between the litigants and as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.843" offset="3704264">First, as to the equities, the critical facts stressed repeatedly in Respondent's briefs in the court of appeals decision is that this lawsuit was brought for accrued obligations after the contract had expired and Kaiser Steel had foregone its various statutory remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.537" offset="3775108">Respondents would not have been able to avoid having the lawfulness of the purchase of coal clause decided if appropriate litigation had been commenced at the outset of the contract period.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.595" offset="3815336">If Kaiser Steel or a non U M W producer had brought a lawsuit seeking declaratory or injunctive relief, or had gone to the NLRB in 1974, as the court of appeals evidently believed it should have, or if Respondents had brought an action seeking specific performance of the purchase of coal clause and Kaiser Steel had raised the illegality defense, or had counterclaimed at that time, then Respondents' ability to enforce the purchase of coal clause would have depended upon its lawfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.864" offset="3936335">If, as should be assumed here, it is illegal, they would not then have been able to enforce the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.518" offset="3962980">Now, this has two significant implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.987" offset="3976878">For one thing, it makes clear that Respondents are not entitled to enforce the purchase of coal clause simply on the ground that this is a collective bargaining agreement, or Kaiser Steel is an employer, or Respondents were third party beneficiaries and pension fund trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.766" offset="4039989">Those facts are not enough, even on the court of appeals and Respondents' theory, to entitle Respondents to enforce this illegal contract clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.204" offset="4077710">The earlier remedies and their consequences also make clear that Respondents' claim is in effect that they should be better off because this lawsuit was commenced in 1978 than they would have teen had there been litigation commenced by them or by anyone else in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.833" offset="4152211">Now, a rule that Respondents could enforce the clause if litigation were brought in 1978, but not if it were brought in 1974, would be inequitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.855" offset="4188365">It is Respondents, not Kaiser Steel, who should bear responsibility for any delay in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.526" offset="4211039">Respondents chose not to bring suit to enforce the purchase of coal clause earlier because it was their policy not to enforce the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.798" offset="4248133">As long as Respondents continued to adhere to that policy, there was no reason for Kaiser Steel to run into court and bring needless, speculative litigation challenging the lawfulness of the purchase of coal clause, and only Respondents, of course, knew whether they were going to abandon their policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.807" offset="4308110">So, if anyone should bear the burden of delay in the commencement of this litigation, it is Respondents, and surely they should not be entitled to turn that delay into an excuse for having new legal rules that would make them better off than they would have been had there been litigation about the lawfulness of this clause at the outset of the contract periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.269" offset="4385955">Moreover, a rule that challenges to the illegality of contract provisions are waived if not raised promptly would trigger premature and often unnecessary lawsuits by a party seeking anticipatory relief from illegal contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.577" offset="4443215">It would cause parties fearful of losing their rights to rush to federal court to bring actions, to rush to the NLRB, and to commence litigation where forbearance might, as had been the pattern in this industry, have avoided litigation altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.836" offset="4500267">In any event, regardless of these considerations, the court of appeals decision is erroneous as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.275" offset="4537988">Both the court of appeals and Respondents recognize that a court cannot be asked to enforce illegal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.195" offset="4569753">But, they argue, Kaiser Steel had refused to participate in the illegal boycott and now all that is at stake is the transfer of money from Kaiser Steel to the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.987" offset="4608832">The gist of their argument is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.003" offset="4616982">A court should not enforce the illegal purchase of coal clause where the effect might be to induce a boycott of non U W producers and thereby injure those producers, but Kaiser Steel may nevertheless be held responsible to pay penalties and damages for its failure to participate in precisely that unlawful boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.416" offset="4698589">There are two basic flaws in this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.018" offset="4709038">First, it rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of both Section 80 of the Labor-Management Relations Act and the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.708" offset="4743728">Those statutes are not intended, as this theory would have it, solely to protect non U M W producers from illegal boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.663" offset="4779568">In the National Woodwork case, this Court held that the primary purpose of Section 80 is to protect employers like Kaiser Steel from being harmed by hot cargo clauses like the purchase of coal clause or by damage actions brought to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.125" offset="4853442">That is precisely what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.827" offset="4864205">The antitrust laws, too, are intended to protect the freedom of companies like Kaiser Steel to do business with whomever they wish without being penalized for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.933" offset="4904642">Therefore, if the purchase of coal clause violates Section 80, or the antitrust laws, then Kaiser Steel as well as non U M W producers is entitled to invoke the protections of those laws, and as Justice Stewart said in his dissent in the Connell case, and as Senator Goldwater said in his remarks about Section 80, Kaiser Steel is entitled simply to ignore and to refuse to comply with the illegal hot cargo clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.916" offset="5008610">Second, Respondents' theory cannot be reconciled with the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.035" offset="5029090">In case after case, which we have discussed in our briefs, the courts have held that a defendant may raise the illegality defense in an action brought to enforce an illegal contract clause, even where the plaintiff is seeking only to recover accrued obligations, and regardless whether the payment of money would itself or in and of itself be illegal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.150" offset="5113518">No case is to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.251" offset="5341932">Perhaps one way to look at that is to bear in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.934" offset="5352695">Respondents' concession that had there been litigation at the outset of the contract period in this case, Respondents could have enjoined as defendants in an action seeking declaratory relief or injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.861" offset="5408388">That is a sound concession, but it concedes really that what is at issue here is whether... is a threshold question whether Respondents are entitled to any money, whether courts should lend their aid to contract clauses of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.103" offset="5461364">Now, let's go back to Lewis v. Benedict Coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.722" offset="5471813">If the employer there had anticipated the strike that he was upset about, gone into court to seek some kind of injunctive or declaratory relief against the union, complaining of its strike, no one would suggest that he could have joined the pension fund trustees as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.982" offset="5540881">The issue there truly was collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.617" offset="5551434">The issue there was whether because the employer felt he was owed some money by the union, he could use that as a set off against money he clearly owned under a valid and lawful provision against the pension fund trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.193" offset="5605664">That is a very different case, Your Honor, because it doesn't raise the threshold question, which is, is there a valid instrument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.447" offset="5634713">Are they entitled to the money?</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.049" offset="5641086">And should a court lend its aid to a contract provision that Congress has declared to be unenforceable and void?</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.119" offset="5669403">The cases that we have cited reflect the important policies that underlie the rule that courts do not enforce illegal contract clauses, all of which apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.796" offset="5720081">The rule against enforcing illegal agreements preserves the role of federal courts as enforcers of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.098" offset="5741292">Whenever a court enforces an unlawful contract provision, it undermines that role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.484" offset="5762817">Penalizing Kaiser Steel for its purchases of coal from a non U M W producer would cause an injury that both the labor laws and the antitrust laws are intended to prevent, and enforcing the purchase of coal clause in this case would encourage other parties to include illegal contract provisions in future agreements and to carry out their illegal terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.079" offset="8249256">Indeed, in the legislative history at several points the sponsors as well as the committee print states the statute clarifies existing law, and also the Bradley decision would, we believe, make clear that the obligation that is being discussed here is the obligation provided by the collective bargaining agreement which always existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.647" offset="8351552">There is no vested right in Kaiser to plead an illegality defense, a pleading by a party that claims it participated as a signer of an unlawful contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.362" offset="8454370">The United States Congress said that there is no public purpose in being able to plead an illegality defense of this nature to a claim of trustees for contributions required by a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.770" offset="8512048">So, in brief, we believe there is no new or unanticipated obligation, and secondly, there is no vested right that Kaiser possessed to plead this defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2878.375" offset="11650399">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, but enacting the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, and particularly Section 306(A) of it, Congress expressed its overriding concern for the economic soundness of multi employer pension and welfare plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.573" offset="11735245">It is our position that in doing so, Congress made the policy decision to accord a higher priority to curtailing interference with the collection of prescribed contributions than to incrementally furthering the ends of the antitrust and labor laws by one particular means, that of permitting contracting parties to defend against suits brought to enforce their contract on the ground of those contracts' illegality under the antitrust or labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.491" offset="11850915">Under the amendments, if payments are due a contract... are due under a contract to a fund, those payments are protected without any need to look beyond the contract to see whether the fund really depends on a payment of those contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.500" offset="11914967">That is all part of the fluctuating Congress's intent of facilitating the collection of contributions due these funds, and not cluttering up the collection process with other issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2967.414" offset="12006605">In both Houses of Congress, the floor managers of the bill that was to become the 1980 amendments delivered carefully prepared and coordinated statements that were drawn largely from a committee print that explicitly purported to represent the views of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.475" offset="12078807">The statements decried the fact that simple collection actions brought by plan trustees had been converted into lengthy, costly, and complex litigation concerning claims and defenses unrelated to the employer's promise and the plan's entitlement to the contribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.661" offset="12211614">Of course, that is right, but the legislators zeroed in on a specific standard which sheds light on the meaning of that specific statutory language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.627" offset="12323418">Now, it is our contention that Congress's explicit intent to protect the financial integrity of multi employer pension plan funds by insulating them from defenses other than those based on Section 186 sheds substantial light on the meaning of Section 306 (A) of the amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.086" offset="14377269">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think the colloquy between the Court and counsel for the Solicitor General at the close of the argument really draws into very sharp focus the difficulties that the Solicitor General and Respondents have in defending their construction of the new amendments to the ERISA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.463" offset="14458771">In that colloquy, it was pointed out that even in so clear a case as a price fitting conspiracy among employers, where they promised to enforce deviations from that conspiracy by paying damages to a pension fund on the Solicitor General's construction of the new amendments, the courts would be powerless to refuse to enforce the promise, would have to award damages, and thus lend their aid to the unlawful conspiracy.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. Douglas Melamed</label>
            <text syncTime="3625.275" offset="14638076">--It is an implied repeal not only of the labor laws and the antitrust laws, but of countless other statutes that one could imagine one might wish to enforce by penal or damage provisions payable to third party beneficiaries or pension fund trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.666" offset="14687604">It would open a gaping loophole in the enforcement of countless federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.320" offset="14706203">It would leave federal courts powerless to prevent violations of law, and it would have these effects notwithstanding the fact that the statutory language purports on its face to preserve the defense that the conduct and the contract is inconsistent with law and that the paltry legislative history is addressed to the very different question, the question illustrated in Huge v. Long's Hauling of an employer's effort to resist compliance with a perfectly lawful contract clause by going to some other illegality unrelated to the clause sought to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.409" offset="14858549">There remains one matter that I did not have an opportunity to address in my opening remarks, and that is the lower court's holding that the district court did not even have jurisdiction to decide whether the purchase of coal clause is an illegal hot cargo clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.805" offset="14928140">Now, this matter has been discussed at length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.405" offset="14938589">In essence, our position is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.107" offset="14949351">Section 80 of the Labor Management Relations Act provides without qualification that all hot cargo clauses are unenforceable and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.565" offset="14987176">There is nothing in the legislative history of that section or in any other legal authority of which we are aware to suggest that Congress meant something different from that, that Congress meant that only some hot cargo clauses are unenforceable and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.407" offset="15046526">Certainly there is nothing in that statute or in the new statute to suggest that Congress might have intended, as the Solicitor General suggested, that the NLRB would be powerless even when it found a hot cargo clause to enjoin its continued compliance or to issue a cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.536" offset="15127088">Moreover, there is ample authority for the proposition that courts have inherent authority to decide whether contract clauses they are asked to enforce are lawful and that federal courts may decide labor law issues in cases where they arise, in cases in which they arise that are properly before the court on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.734" offset="15211829">It is simply unthinkable that a federal court should be required to enforce a contract without even having the power to decide whether the contract is lawful and valid and thus whether it creates any enforceable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.559" offset="15267209">If Your Honors have no questions, I am prepared to end my argument.</text>
