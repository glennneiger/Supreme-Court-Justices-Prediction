            <text syncTime="133.770" offset="611788">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="137.055" offset="624953">The single issue presented is the constitutionality of the Kentucky conspicuous posting of notice in landlord and tenants cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.360" offset="670198">An alternative statement of the problem addressed is whether or not alternative constructive posting service continues to be satisfactory notice under the due process clause, unless shored up with additional mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.324" offset="746057">The facts of this case should be addressed in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.559" offset="762984">Number one, what in fact is the landlord and tenant or forcible eviction procedure in Kentucky; and number two, as concerns the specific plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.468" offset="814602">I would point out that I believe the facts of the case speak very strongly about notice in the legislative scheme that is set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.657" offset="855353">First, the landlord must notify the tenant in writing that the tenant is in breach of the lease for failure to make his rent payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.049" offset="900911">That writing is by registered or certified mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.603" offset="923167">The tenant is on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.571" offset="935079">The second fact of the legislative scheme is that the written notice is defined under the statutes quite clearly, and only after that notice is sent as a condition precedent to the bringing of a Writ of Forcible Entry are you allowed to seek such an instrument, and in fact, the forcible writ cannot be sought until seven days after this notice is sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.222" offset="1045629">You then file in our lower court for a forcible writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.642" offset="1071334">This writ is subsequently served under the statute, which is the issue of this case, 454.030.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.034" offset="1116891">It is served one of three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.119" offset="1125251">It's served by actually serving the tenant, if you can find the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.022" offset="1144790">Secondly, by leaving a copy of it with a 16-year old or better who would understand the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.776" offset="1175824">And only thirdly by mailing, as we call it, only thirdly by posting the Writ of Eviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.315" offset="1213962">Next,--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="286.501" offset="1222740">Mr. Hoge, I see the statute says... as to what you describe as the second method of service... that the process server may explain and leave a copy of the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.373" offset="1262237">Have the Kentucky courts construed the phrase "may explain"?</text>
            <text syncTime="301.111" offset="1281149">What does that mean?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_l_hoge_iii" startTime="302.227" stopTime="459.577">
            <label>Mr. William L. Hoge, III</label>
            <text syncTime="302.227" offset="1285642">--No, sir, I do not believe they have construed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.831" offset="1300062">Nor, in fact, is this... has that particular section ever been tested at all, to my understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.151" offset="1325349">After it is posted, should that be the method... and, of course, that would be the only issue that would concern this Court today... then another period of time, seven days, at least three days, must expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.332" offset="1414060">However, the record speaks clearly in this matter that there is at least two weeks or so after that finding before another writ, the Writ of Possession, is issued, and then another period of three days goes by prior to any literal set-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.076" offset="1493055">Now, I think the facts of this complaint tell the Court a great deal about the truth of service by posting in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.217" offset="1541642">Number one, all three plaintiffs did not pay their rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.521" offset="1558883">There is no tenant in this case whatsoever that alleges that they paid their rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.442" offset="1590544">Nor was the class so defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.329" offset="1610083">Nor, in fact, can I conceive of any of the statistics which have been thrown in this case subsequently showing that any of the tenants, in fact, paid the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.569" offset="1663060">Second, and which I purport is very strong evidence, notice that the landlord may well be subsequently upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.775" offset="1699840">Next, I will point out each and every plaintiff in this case was at least two months in arrears.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.514" offset="1730769">Not only had they not paid the rent once and there was some mistake about the matter; they had withheld their rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.118" offset="1761176">Next, all three plaintiffs alleged... and that's the extent of the proof in the matter, by the way,... that they did not receive the Writ of the forcible detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.842" offset="1808091">But the most important fact, I believe, in the entire case is that all three plaintiffs got the Writ of Possession, the second writ, by precisely the same means, by the posting statute, by the exact same service method, and all three admit that in their complaint.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="463.881" offset="1932225">In the complaint it states that it was found inside on the floor, and that it had apparently been stuck through the mail slot in the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.338" offset="1978096">All three allege it was found in their apartment on the floor, and apparently put through the mail slot.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.425" offset="2006413">There is a case in Kentucky on that--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="492.131" offset="2045283">Possibly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.768" offset="2067853">It is not the same in that we have no idea whether or not they got the original writ forcible.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.041" offset="2100872">We only have an idea of whether or not they did get the second one... other than their allegation that they did not receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.963" offset="2132637">Now, whether or not this statute is unconstitutional in the way the sheriffs practice the posting of the notice is an entirely different issue, and I don't believe has been addressed at all in this case, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.923" offset="2196480">And number two, might well have represented some type of complaint by some type of person that might have been in this class, but we don't have any record whatsoever on that kind of thing happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.766" offset="2255830">There is one case in Kentucky and unfortunately, I'm reticent to cite it because I don't have the cite with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.355" offset="2286132">It's right under the forcible statute today, that says that placing of the notice was posting by placing it in the grill of the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.627" offset="2323226">And a number of people did testify in their depositions that oftentimes they did stick it through the hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.900" offset="2360320">They considered posting all the way more effective.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="576.554" offset="2382994">Mr. Hoge, I take it there was evidence which was not contradicted at the trial or in the court to the effect that the posted notices are sometimes removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.414" offset="2446420">And was there any evidence produced as to the frequency with which mailed notices might be lost or not delivered?</text>
            <text syncTime="605.906" offset="2500336">Was there any evidence about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="616.462" offset="2542550">The evidence in this case was presented by six deputy sheriffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.724" offset="2607647">Yes, sir, one deposition taken in my office where the six deputy sheriffs, all of whom are politically appointed, gave their best opinion on what transpired and what they thought happened in forcible cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.500" offset="2670759">Most of the time, they were confused about whether or not it was a forcible or a Writ of Possession, whether or not they were setting a person out or whether they were serving the original eviction notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.510" offset="2730736">And they were quite apprehensive about what happened to them in attempting to serve writs for setouts, writs for possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.801" offset="2767935">Yes, in that situation they were most upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.268" offset="2777861">Now, I won't mislead the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.252" offset="2785802">There is testimony in here in the Joint Appendix, that a number of the deputy sheriffs testified that they had seen on a very few occasions where a writ had been taken down by another tenant in the same building.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.481" offset="2858632">But that was, in fact, the extent of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.035" offset="2876918">And the matter went to cross-motions for summary judgment in that the Sixth Circuit case was, on all fours beyond a question, the Weber case was right on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.276" offset="2929894">The district court judge addressed the Weber decision, found it be constitutional, stated that it was unfortunate that the additional mailing--</text>

            <text syncTime="732.922" offset="3008470">And he comments on that but he says it's a salutary rule that he was bound by, and points outs that the Weber decision had been the law for some 70 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.616" offset="3071164">And quite frankly, it appears pretty clear that he felt it was unfortunate that mailing could not be mandated by a federal court as an additional due process safeguard in this particular case, but could not be mandated by a federal court since due process does not require a state to adopt the optimum method of service, but only a minimum standard to be satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="957.716" offset="3907605">Now, the amicus point out that there are 17 states that have this type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.555" offset="3938952">We believe that this statute in and of itself, as the legislature has found, and in fact written a law, is constitutionally sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="996.075" offset="4061100">Number two, the mailing issue in and of itself was somewhat unclear to me in the Sixth Circuit's decision as they cite the New York case, which is the one of three or four cases where this has been legitimately addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.386" offset="4134243">And in the New York case, the New York statute provides for a mailing as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.119" offset="4441234">If this Court were to sustain the Sixth Circuit's decision that it would be, in my paraphrasing, much better to mail, I would have no system by which to have a statute passed to allow for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.936" offset="7000503">Mr. Chief Justice, my it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.405" offset="7014400">Before I get to my prepared remarks I would like to address, if I may, some of the questions that the Court has previously asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.324" offset="7046060">I am perhaps at a bit of advantage from Mr. Hoge in that I've had an opportunity to practice tenant-landlord law for quite sometime with our office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.699" offset="7083572">And I don't want this Court to have an incorrect impression of what the law may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.786" offset="7115860">Mr. Hoge was correct when he says that sometimes, a landlord may send a letter requesting the rental payment, but I can tell you from my experience, most landlords do not send a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.613" offset="7171239">And the provision of the law under which the letter is sent is under the Uniform Residential Landlord-Tenant Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.035" offset="7200914">Mr. Hoge is correct in pointing out to this Court that that Act currently applies to only three of Kentucky's 100... excuse me, two of Kentucky's 118 counties, and one additional city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.293" offset="7253891">In all other counties in Kentucky, the landlord is not required to send a letter prior to a writ being initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.382" offset="7286282">And I would also say that even if the landlord were required to send a letter, and even if the landlord does send a letter, it is interesting to note that under Kentucky law, that letter must be hand-delivered or sent by Registered Mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.507" offset="7330795">And even if the tenant gets that letter, there is no court date on it, there's no reason to believe that that letter in and of itself calls the person to court, because it does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.705" offset="7427553">But like I said, my experience has been there are numerous, close to 90 % of the cases that I have been involved in, the landlord has not sent the letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.532" offset="7590870">Justice Rehnquist, I think that that's a very interesting question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.767" offset="7607798">I think that this Court must look at the peculiarity of the current application of the Uniform Residential Landlord-Tenant Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.007" offset="7636741">But it is our position that with regard to posting, posting is unconstitutional because it is not reasonably calculated to appraise the tenant of pending litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.729" offset="7683657">Now, Mr. Hoge has mentioned that there is another writ that is sent out by the Kentucky courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.484" offset="7714691">That is true, but that writ is sent out only after a judgment has been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.655" offset="7739350">And in this particular case, and in some of the cases, again, that I have been involved with, that writ is not received by the tenant until after the judgment is there, and after the time to appeal has lapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.517" offset="7806851">There is Kentucky law which indicates that if you do not appeal an unfavorable decision in the Kentucky district court, the tenant-landlord court, the circuit court which is the next highest court has no jurisdiction to entertain any sort of remedial action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.951" offset="7916565">I might also add that Mr. Hoge indicated that the tenants had not paid their rent in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.655" offset="7939344">Long, long ago and far, far away that may have been true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.623" offset="7951256">But in fact, what occurred was the people offered their rent and the rent was refused by the public housing authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.361" offset="7978214">And if you will note in our record, we initiated litigation involving the public housing authorities, and that particular issue, the payment of rent, was settled favorably to the tenants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.966" offset="8120633">We in Kentucky with a minority of other states have a method of service of process which has come from a time that has long since passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.472" offset="8154593">This same method of process risks our state court and those like it in becoming a landlord's rubber stamp, despite your warnings and ruling in Pernell versus Southall Realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.113" offset="8201195">Posting simply does not withstand constitutional scrutiny at this time because it is not reasonably calculated, nor reasonably certain to appraise the tenant of the pending litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.187" offset="8249469">Before I get into the constitutional ramifications before this Court, however, I would like to take just one moment to discuss the importance of an eviction action in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.795" offset="8291892">Possession is no longer the sole issue before a court in an eviction matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.584" offset="8327105">Landlords, in addition to possession, are now requesting back payment of rent, which is permitted under Kentucky statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.254" offset="8357721">Tenants are defending their rights to stay in their homes and are counterclaiming for damages, usually based upon a landlord's failure to provide essential services and repairs to the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2094.187" offset="8453538">The posting statute which allows the three-tier process but that final tier being posting, is an avenue available to a landlord to request both possession and for back rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.915" offset="8524382">And that is in the Kentucky revised statute Section 383.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.219" offset="8541623">I would guess it's.685, but I'm not sure what the balance of that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.273" offset="8561789">But in Kentucky, in those jurisdictions that have URLTA you may not only request possession, but you may also request back rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.277" offset="8589897">Clearly, there has been a great change in the tenant-landlord law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.431" offset="8610482">Appellants argue that posting satisfies the constitutional requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
