            <text syncTime="15.307" offset="195194">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.900" offset="213584">This case is here on the petition of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.801" offset="253185">The statute involved is Section 106 of Public Law 92-129, which was enacted in 1971 and which forbids discrimination against United States citizens or dependents by the Department of Defense in its employment of civilians on military bases overseas unless "prohibited by treaty".</text>
            <text syncTime="50.526" offset="336150">The single question presented by this case is whether the word II, Section 2 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.707" offset="412846">In 1944 Congress authorized the President by such means as he should find appropriate to withhold or to acquire and to retain such military and naval bases as he deemed necessary for the mutual protection of the United States and the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.138" offset="482540">The means the President found appropriate were two international agreements: the 1947 Military Bases Agreement between the United States and the Philippines, and the Supplemental 1968 Base Labor Agreement, which is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.351" offset="543458">Neither of these agreements was ever submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.972" offset="561953">In the Military Bases Agreement the United States obtained, among other things, the 99-year use of several designated military bases located in the Philippines, as well as the right upon only notice to the Philippines to the use of additional facilities there as required by military necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.246" offset="638962">The major military facilities currently used by the United States in the Philippines are the Clark Air Base and the naval facility at Subic Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.524" offset="676160">Article I of the Base Labor Agreement provides that the United States Armed Forces in the Philippines will fill its needs for civilian employment on these bases with Filipino citizens except when the needed skills are found not to be locally available, or for reasons of security or special management needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.247" offset="778978">In those cases, United States nationals may be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.137" offset="794547">When Section 106 was passed in 1971 there were in existence approximately a dozen additional such agreements in which the United States provided some form of employment preference for local nationals in exchange for the use of valuable strategic facilities located abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.520" offset="864137">In March 1978 four of the respondents in this case were notified that their jobs as game room managers at the United States naval facility at Subic Bay were being converted into local national positions in accordance with Article I of the Base Labor Agreement, and that they would be discharged from their employment with the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.591" offset="940415">The four respondents subsequently were discharged, and after exhausting their administrative remedies, they filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, claiming that their discharges violated Section 106, among other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.991" offset="1001959">Approximately 30 additional plaintiffs joined in this suit, alleging either that they had expressed interest in civilian employment with the United States Navy in the Philippines but had failed to obtain such employment because of the local national employment preference contained in the agreement, or that they had been rejected for a specific civilian position with the Navy in the Philippines because the positions for which they had applied were reserved for local nationals under Article I of the Base Labor Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.699" offset="1108852">The District Court denied Respondents' claim and granted summary judgment for the Petitioners on the ground that the word 106 encompasses all binding international agreements, including the Base Labor Agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.570" offset="3152255">In our view, given the sparse and largely superficial legislative history of Section 106, it is conceivable that Congress' purpose in enacting that statute could have been the drastic one of placing the United States in breach of all non-Article II agreements that contained local national employment preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.826" offset="3229368">Section 106 was only a very small part of what became Public Law No. 92-129, an act to amend the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 to increase military pay and for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.322" offset="3283285">Very little legislative debate was devoted to the provision, and only a few Senators addressed themselves to what became Section 106.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.797" offset="3357159">But as I alluded to earlier, at the time Section 106 was enacted, there were in existence 12 non-Article II agreements to which the United States was a party and which provided some form of employment preference for local national in exchange for the United States' right to use military facilities located in the host country.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.947" offset="3433855">To many of the countries with which we have such agreements, particularly to the Philippines, the United States' satisfaction of its needs for civilian employment of local nationals is a significant quid pro quo for the host countries permitting the United States to use facilities located on its sovereign territory; yet no here in the legislative history is even one of these international agreements mentioned, much less did Congress express any concern for the drastic consequences that a statute placing the United States in breach of such agreements could have on this nation's continuing access to necessary strategic facilities or on the United States' relations with the contracting countries in general.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.621" offset="3868532">But here, where there are two equally reasonable constructions of the word "treaty", that usage should he chosen which will place the United... which will not place the United States in violation of international obligations that Congress expressed absolutely no intention to breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.709" offset="3932898">Our construction of the word 106 fully capable of meeting the goals Congress sought to serve by its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.846" offset="3965394">The most obvious of them was the prevention of discrimination against Americans or their dependents by virtue of directives by individual officers such as the unilateral order of Charles Phipps, then the commanding general of the European Exchange System in Europe, to fill European Exchange System positions with local nationals instead of American dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.837" offset="4049404">In addition to the legislative debate's focus on the action of General Phipps, which we have detailed in our brief, the very fact that all of the examples listed in Section 106... officers clubs, postal exchanges, and commissary stores... are nonappropriated fund activities, as were the positions within General Phipps' control, suggests that it was indeed his action Congress had in mind when it enacted that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.232" offset="4154939">Since Congress' enactment of Section 106, the executive branch has continued to negotiate and enter into non-Article II agreements that provide some form of local national preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.259" offset="4203004">Each of these agreements has been transmitted to Congress pursuant to the Case Act, and no member of Congress has expressed concern to the Department of State that either these later agreements or any of the pre-existing agreements runs afoul of Section 106.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.049" offset="4266220">Moreover, subsequent Congresses have encouraged the executive branch to review and attempt to renegotiate existing international agreements in order to enhance employment opportunities for United States citizens and dependents overseas, but only to the extent feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.244" offset="4338945">Nowhere is there any suggestion that this prodding of the executive branch is based on any perception that the continued employment of local nationals pursuant to non-Article II treaties violates Section 106.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.990" offset="4389936">To the contrary, these exhortations assume the continuing existence and vitality of non-Article II agreements providing for local national preferences, notwithstanding Section 106; and they nearly urge the executive branch to do what it can within the recognized constraints on it to ameliorate the shortage of jobs available to American citizens and dependents overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.214" offset="4494844">This post-enactment legislative history suggests that another purpose Congress may have had in enacting Section 106, a purpose that also fully comports with the use of the word "treaty" in its broader sense, was simply to let the executive branch know that Congress was concerned there were more... I'm sorry... that there were not more jobs available to United States citizens and dependents on military bases abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.016" offset="4602051">By the treaty exception contained in Section 106 Congress recognized the necessity in some cases for the executive to offer the quid pro quo of local national employment in order to secure the use of strategically necessary military facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.696" offset="4668820">Nevertheless, Congress was sending the executive branch a message which it was to repeat in the future, to the effect that were possible, it should attempt to avoid reducing the number of jobs available to Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.238" offset="4722945">Construing the word 106 as extending to all binding international agreements renders both the ban on employment discrimination contained in that provision and the treaty exception to it reasonable and meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.980" offset="4785953">By contrast, to construe the word II treaties, as Respondents urge, would vitiate the treaty exception altogether since, as Respondents concede, there were no Article II treaties that provided for local national employment preferences at the time Section 106 was enacted, and any subsequent Article II treaty that might do so could supersede a previous inconsistent statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.225" offset="6234913">We know that the Department of Defense told Senator Schweiker in the hearings on the 1971 measure that it was the policy of the United States to encourage the hiring of U.S. citizens, not local nationals; that there had been some trouble with it in the past but that they were embarking on a new frontier, and they actually anticipated giving dependents a preference over others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.278" offset="6335118">That was in 1971, in the legislative history of the measure that became the Schweiker amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.588" offset="6356330">We know that Senator Schweiker in the floor debates said that what had happened in Europe, the one example in the legislative history cited by the government had been corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.709" offset="6396872">The Court of Appeals unanimously felt that that one incident had already been rendered moot and had by the executive's own position at the time been inconsistent with the position of the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.813" offset="6449221">So there is no indication whatsoever as of 1971 or any time since that commanders are given the discretion to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.450" offset="6491853">The DOD instructions, which we have included in the... a couple of passages from in the... in our brief, the DOD instruction from 1974, for example, says that dependents are to get a preference only to the extent of treaties and agreements requiring local national preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.254" offset="6563011">So that's there no option, at least on paper, in the Department of Defense for local commanders to do this and apparently never has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.564" offset="6592268">The key, though, is even internally in the Department of Defense there's a distinction between treaty and other agreements, and in particular, the 1961 policy that was in effect and was the circular in effect at the time of this legislation, provided... and I think this is extremely important to keep in mind... the policy at the time provided the military departments will, consistent with status of forces agreements, country to country agreements and treaties, make the maximum feasible reduction in the number of local national employees for nonappropriated fund activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.251" offset="6755063">That was in 1961 and was the policy then in effect for the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.405" offset="6775647">So there was no policy of local commanders being allowed to create side arrangements whereby there were local national preferences.</text>

            <text syncTime="2508.235" offset="10166968">The point in all those cases, there was absolutely no intent to abrogate evidence in the record of the act, and in fact, in Chae Chan Ping this Court said it's wholly immaterial whether the departure from the treaty was accidental or designed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.748" offset="12372957">I just have a few points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.560" offset="12384242">The fact that the discrimination that occurred as a result of General Phipps' action was done in contravention of then existing law leaves room for Section 106 to apply in the future to other examples of discrimination that could be done also in contravention of existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.146" offset="12470550">Although... while it's true that the same 92nd Congress that enacted Section 106 also enacted the Case Act, number one, the Case Act was referred to in the conference, in the report on it as only for informational purposes; and moreover, there's no hint whatsoever in any of the legislative history of Section 106 that there was any concern behind that legislation with any presidential abuse of the executive agreement power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.853" offset="12573473">With respect to your question, Justice Stevens, the only agreement in Europe at the time Section 106 was passed was an agreement with Iceland, and that... no, Iceland did not arise in the discussion of Section 106.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.861" offset="12653407">In fact, the discussion centered around discrimination that was going on in Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.202" offset="12674828">And as we pointed out before, the NATO SOFA which controlled the German situation did not provide any local national employment preferences, nor did it classify jobs as local national or other position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.150" offset="12726655">In effect, what General Phipps was doing was exactly to classify jobs as local nationals, because he took 4,000 positions that had been held by Americans and said he wanted to have them filled by local nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.020" offset="12786109">Just to clarify, the exhortations by Stevenson were in the legislative history, the subsequent legislative history, not in the legislative history of Section 106 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.906" offset="12829682">And indeed, the exhortation to hire more dependents was one within the constraint of existing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.090" offset="12858416">Also, with respect to the need... the point we have made for a need for a showing of intent to abrogate, we agree where two enactments are clearly inconsistent, irreconcilable, then there's no question that the earlier must give way to the later; but whereas here there are two possible constructions, then you do look for an intent to abrogate, and in the absence of such an intent, then you try to read the two statutes together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.985" offset="12973982">With respect to the Case Act provision and why if we believe our agreements are treaties within the meaning of Section 106 we submit those agreements under the Case Act, the Case Act would have no meaning unless international agreements were what was supposed to be submitted under it, international agreements other than Article II treaties, because the Senate at least would already have been aware of Article II treaties.</text>
