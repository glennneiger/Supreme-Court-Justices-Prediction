            <label>Mr. Jerome B. Falk, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="77.875" offset="449415">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.640" offset="452445">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, though we were here before in California versus Texas, the issues of jurisdiction now presented by this petition were not addressed in any of the brief of the parties, or with the exception of the Eleventh Amendment issue in the concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.493" offset="519841">Indeed, it is fair to say that in the days following the decision in California versus Texas, many of us, myself included, thought that the concurring opinions had pointed the way to a workable and fair procedure for the resolution of the domicile dispute concerning the domicile of Howard Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.363" offset="591312">However, in the months that followed, numerous procedural and jurisdictional problems not ventillated in California versus Texas became apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.905" offset="625480">I intend to discuss three grounds which preclude, in our view, preclude the district court from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.916" offset="661529">A central theme of those issues is that Congress has simply never undertaken to fashion a statutory process for the resolution of interstate death tax controversies of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.724" offset="708759">The court of appeals sought to bend the federal Interpleader Act to that task, but for the three reasons I will discuss, the Act simply will not serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.907" offset="745539">Moreover, though I will not separately discuss the issue today of changing venue, the court of appeals use and understanding of the Interpleader Act would produce what we believe is the absurd and unfair result of requiring a state, California in this instance, to litigate its death tax claim for what is an enormous sum of money before a jury of Texas citizens when the issue involves the rival claim of the state of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.287" offset="862986">We submit that this is, if nothing else, further evidence that Congress could not possibly have intended the Interpleader Act to be used in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.534" offset="896004">The first ground of objecting to jurisdiction is, of course, 28 U.S.C. 1251 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="196.420" offset="923590">Although Congress has in recent years allowed concurrent lower court jurisdiction for most categories of controversies which are within the court's original jurisdiction, one category has remained outside the concurrent jurisdiction mode, and has always been within the court's original and exclusive jurisdiction, namely, controversy among different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.413" offset="1015541">There is no way to square the maintenance of this action in a district court with the clear command of Congress in Section 1251(a) that only this Court can hear such controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.986" offset="1053784">Now, in making that statement I am, of course, mindful that in California versus Texas, the Court declined to permit us to exercise or to invoke the original jurisdiction, and I am also aware that three Justices wrote then that there was not then a justiciable controversy between California and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.212" offset="1134764">As the Court knows, we have now filed a new motion for leave to file an original complaint, and at Pages 28 to 39 of that motion, we endeavor to show that there is indeed a present case or controversy between California and Texas, but that question isn't presented here, and need not be addressed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.845" offset="1217311">I say that because this case is different from what was before the Court in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.904" offset="1241448">Then Justice Stewart was able to write that each state was free to proceed in its own courts, and each state could obtain, in theory, in its own courts a favorable judgment, without regard to the acts of the other or the proceedings in the courts of the other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.507" offset="1307903">That is no longer true.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.038" offset="1314068">Now that there has been filed an interpleader action, California and Texas must square off as adversaries in a federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.597" offset="1356282">Each must file pleadings answering the claim of the other, and responding to the position of the other, for that is standard interpleader practice, and because the claims are mutually inconsistent, it California wins, Texas must lose, and if Texas wins, California must lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.419" offset="1427544">Each is enjoined by the district court from proceeding in their respective state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.839" offset="1449278">The states are, in short, litigation adversaries in a single lawsuit, and this is therefore now a controversy between states within the meaning of Section 1251, even if one agrees with what was said in the concurring opinions in California versus Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.331" offset="1511240">If you were legitimately before the district court in an interpleader action, is it impossible that that court could conclude that under the law of California as well as under the law of Texas, that Mr. Hughes was a domiciliary of both states?</text>
            <text syncTime="360.965" offset="1581771">Is that impossible?</text>

            <text syncTime="362.700" offset="1588667">Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is impossible under our law and under the law of the state of Texas, and I believe under the law of every state in the United States, but certainly under the laws of the two states.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.926" offset="1653555">No, I don't think so, Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.598" offset="1660243">I think the courts' decisions make clear that states can have other bases for taxation, but in the cases of California and Texas, they do not.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="389.017" offset="1693993">What I was trying to get at is, do you think it is a constitutional principle that one may have only one domicile?</text>

          <turn speaker="jerome_b_falk_jr" startTime="395.046" stopTime="397.779">

            <text syncTime="395.046" offset="1718026">No, I meant to say that I do not believe it is constitutional principle.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="397.779" stopTime="398.029">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_b_falk_jr" startTime="398.029" stopTime="748.246">
            <label>Mr. Jerome B. Falk, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="398.029" offset="1730042">It is simply the law of California and the law of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.950" offset="1737670">I make the statement, then, that we are... that this is a controversy between states without regard to what the Court may ultimately say about our pending motion for leave to file a new original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.882" offset="1789392">Naturally, we hope, for the reasons stated there, that the Court will permit it to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.613" offset="1808305">But we also recognize that there are prudential or may be prudential limitations on the exercise of original jurisdiction in this situation, some of which were discussed by Justice Stewart in his concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.280" offset="1858982">If the Court declines on any of those grounds to permit California to invoke the original jurisdiction, the fact remains that Congress has not created an alternative form in a district court for the litigation of controversies between states which this Court declines to adjudicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.883" offset="1925438">This Court has turned down over the years many suits brought by one state against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.022" offset="1953964">Not too many days ago it declined to hear a controversy between California and the state of West Virginia over an unplayed football game.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.956" offset="1989699">The decision by the Court not to permit jurisdiction to be invoked in that case did not automatically create jurisdiction in some other court for the resolution of that controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.967" offset="2029719">So, for those reasons, we believe Section 1251(a) bars this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.527" offset="2048004">The second ground for objection to jurisdiction, which of course the Court does not need to reach if it agrees with the first, is a constitutional one, founded on the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.039" offset="2090009">The Court's cases have traditionally identified two distinct requirements which must be satisfied for suit to be brought against a state officer in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.300" offset="2135044">First, there must be a colorable allegation that the defendant has acted unconstitutionally or in violation of his statutory authority or her statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.170" offset="2174542">Second, only prospective injunctive relief is being sought, or at least that there be sought prospective injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.136" offset="2206411">In this case, the second requirement is satisfied, but the first is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.009" offset="2225951">Here the Texas and California taxing officials who are defendants are plainly acting within their statutory authority, and they are not violating the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.411" offset="2275479">Obviously, the domicile claim advanced by one or the other or conceivably by both of the state taxing officials is wrong on the facts, but that does not make the assertion of the claim unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.984" offset="2325843">All each of these officials seek to do is to submit their relevant evidence to a court of competent jurisdiction and obtain a judicial determination in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.745" offset="2364818">Worcester County Trust Company versus Riley holds that this does not violate the Constitution, and that portion of the opinion in that case has never been questioned and was not questioned in the concurring opinions in California versus Texas, and is supported by many decisions of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.833" offset="2425213">Thus, one is brought to the state's principal argument, that Edelman versus Jordan somehow dispensed with the requirement that illegality be shown, and left only the requirement that prospective relief be sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.296" offset="2483100">I recognize that three Justices implied in California versus Texas that this was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.902" offset="2509536">With all respect, I think Edelman does not stand for that proposition, and that indeed there is no warrant for what would be a genuinely radical change in our Eleventh Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.647" offset="2560422">Edelman focused on and clarified the line between prospective relief, which is allowed, and retrospective relief, which is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.754" offset="2592919">But it could not have held that the first requirement, a showing of unconstitutional conduct or violation of statute, need not be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.469" offset="2627714">It could not have held that, because in Edelman the defendants were found to have violated a controlling federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.216" offset="2650702">Now, the element of illegality is an integral part of the Eleventh Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.557" offset="2676093">It follows from Ex parte Young, in which the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar a suit against state officers if the officer was acting unconstitutionally, on the ground, admittedly somewhat ficticious, but an important fiction, on the ground that the illegality of the conduct severed the officer's nexus to the state, and thus the suit could be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.984" offset="2777866">For that reason, the element of illegality in an Eleventh Amendment case is crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.388" offset="2799391">Without it, the suit against a state officer in his official capacity remains a suit against the state, and thus barred by the Eleventh Amendment, regardless of whether the relief is retrospective or prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.008" offset="2849859">No decision of this Court has ever suggested that the requirement of unconstitutional or illegal conduct could be dispensed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.192" offset="2882669">Indeed, the Court reaffirmed the requirement of illegal conduct, of unconstitutional conduct or a violation of the statute, in Larson versus Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.642" offset="2928435">That is not a case cited in the briefs, I regret to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.672" offset="2940556">It is found at 337 U.S. 682.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.593" offset="2952259">That is a case involving the parallel rule of sovereign immunity for federal officials, and has been cited by the Court as reflecting of good Eleventh Amendment law as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.181" offset="2998653">In Larson, the defendant's conduct was assertedly tortious, and also in violation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.115" offset="3026342">Prospective relief was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.068" offset="3034179">The Court nonetheless held that sovereign immunity barred the suit against the federal officer because his conduct was neither unconstitutional or in violation of his statutory power, against a claim that it was illegal and thus also permissible as a suit, because it was tortious.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.076" offset="3110143">Therefore, acceptance of the state's Eleventh Amendment theory--</text>

            <text syncTime="901.669" offset="3744605">Because the law of sovereign immunity for federal officers and the law of the Eleventh Amendment for state officers has been linked over the years and somewhat homogenized, a decision in this case dispensing with the requirement of illegality would effectively overrule the Larson case and destroy a workable line of demarcation which has existed at least since Ex parte Young, and I think it would also open the doors to federal courts to suits against state and federal officers for injunctive relief in a wide variety of cases theretofore barred by sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment, such as suits to enjoin a breach of contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome B. Falk, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="941.637" offset="3904475">Well, I don't think there is any difference in principle between interpleader and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.322" offset="3935195">As a matter of fact, in a sense, interpleader is an even easier case than Larson.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.068" offset="3958182">In Larson, there was illegal conduct in the sense of tortious conduct, and yet the Court said tortious conduct is still within the officer's authority and is not... and suit may not be maintained against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.580" offset="4004158">So, I think, in a sense this is a less close case than a tort case would be, as you had in Larson.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.781" offset="4029027">The third ground of objection I will speak to very briefly, and that has to do with subject matter jurisdiction under the Interpleader Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.635" offset="4076465">When one looks at the Interpleader Act, and tries to fit it to suits of this kind, the fit is very poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.039" offset="4114081">Section 1335 requires at least two claimants of citizenship of diverse states, and refers to the general definition of diverse citizenship in the diversity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.172" offset="4166535">This requirement has been referred to as minimal diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.344" offset="4179283">But neither the United States nor taxing officials of... or any officials of states or states themselves are citizens of states, so the Act doesn't apply to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.651" offset="4224527">And thus the court of appeals found minimal diversity here only as to two parties, neither of whom were the state taxing officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.476" offset="4267786">The first was Mr. Lummis, who is the administrator of the Hughes estate, and the stakeholder who filed the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.128" offset="4294431">The court of appeals held that his citizenship could be considered because he was an interested stakeholder in the sense that he also has a claim, was therefore a claimant, and his citizenship of Nevada could be considered as one of the two claimants for minimal diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.779" offset="4357020">We think that was error for reasons discussed in the brief, and which I will not repeat here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.386" offset="4375410">But even if Mr. Lummis qualifies as one of the two necessary claimants, there is a serious problem with the necessary second one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.384" offset="4407384">The court of appeals found that second claimant in Mr. Alvord, the Los Angeles County treasurer, who it found was a claimant because under the then existing law the county of Los Angeles was to receive a tiny fraction of the state inheritance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.861" offset="4465271">However, effective January 1, 1981, California law was changed as part of an overall revision of the inheritance and gift tax law, and the entire tax is now paid to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.826" offset="4509157">Mr. Alvord will get nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.513" offset="4515949">The county of Los Angeles will get nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1101.978" offset="4545833">It had been a state bar proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.587" offset="4556178">It had been pending for years, and we had absolutely nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.180" offset="4570597">As a result of the legislation, however, Mr. Alvord has abandoned any claim to the fund, and must be dismissed as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.893" offset="4601422">Thus, if jurisdiction is determined as of this moment, or at least as of January 1, 1981, we have only one claimant and minimal diversity has not been satisfied, and there is no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.531" offset="4644053">The estate argues, however, that jurisdiction must be determined as of the date the complaint was filed, when Alvord did have a claim, and that subsequent events do not affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.214" offset="4682715">That is, to be sure, consistent with a general rule that jurisdiction be measured at the time a complaint is filed, but we say that this case falls within a second... within a clearly marked exception to that general rule, and that is that where a party is added or deleted after a complaint is filed, then the courts re-examine jurisdiction in light of the new lineup of parties, and we cite at Pages 33 and 34 of our brief six different categories of cases, every conceivable permutation in which this rule has been applied by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.481" offset="4823776">And therefore, because Mr. Alvord is not a claimant today, and must be dismissed as a party, subject matter jurisdiction under Section 1335 is absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.288" offset="4879051">Now, many states, including California, have voluntarily agreed by statute to submit to binding arbitration as a means of resolving controversies of this kind.</text>

Pennsylvania case, which was 24 years after Worcester County, has changed that result at least insofar as the Worcester County Court held that there was nothing unconstitutional about each state taxing the same intangible assets of the estate, because Western Union held that when one state goes forward to escheat... it was an escheat case... the intangibles, it cannot provide relief from a later judgment in another state court that that denied the stakeholder due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.788" offset="6165007">We feel that we are on all fours with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.882" offset="6177441">We have intangible assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.626" offset="6228432">And we are not looking for a windfall in this case, because even if we prevail in this interpleader case, we are going to be taxed at the rate of 77 percent total, and that doesn't include the matters of interest which we have alluded to, and that doesn't include the matter of the California deductions if it were determined to be California domiciled, to which we are not entitled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.288" offset="6327071">As a matter of policy, we believe that the ends of federalism would actually be served and promoted by permitting us to go forward with this interpleader action, because it would give a binding determination, binding on both the administrators of the estate and on the state tax officials, and it will free them from the burden of having to race to judgment, a race to collection in this case, in which the assets of the estate... the tax rate, the applicable tax rates in totality are going to exceed the assets of the estate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rick Harrison</label>
            <text syncTime="2313.306" offset="9391129">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I might be so bold as to inform the Court that Mr. Lilienstern and I are colleagues in profession, but not in parties, and our interests are quite different, as my argument should reveal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.329" offset="9471169">Your Honors, four years ago California brought Texas before this Court, and Texas postulated its position, let the states alone, let them settle these tax matters in their own state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.026" offset="9533967">This matter is not ripe for controversy before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.275" offset="9550999">As I hope my argument should reveal, there is no change of circumstances that has transpired during that four years that changed the factual unripeness of the estate that existed when this Court unanimously turned down California's motion to file an original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.578" offset="9644204">That unanimous decision of this Court we had hoped would free Texas to continue its claim and allow California to pursue in its own state courts whatever claim it chose to pursue against the Hughes estate, and whatever claim it could prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.979" offset="9709823">But due to the fact that we have been enjoined by lower federal courts from proceeding, both states, there has been no progress at all in perfecting either state's position insofar as a right to tax this estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.253" offset="9770845">Texas' position today is as it was four years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.876" offset="9789340">The federal courts, with all due respect, should leave this matter to the states, at least until, as Justice Stewart pointed out in the concurring opinion in California v. Texas, the matter has ripened with determinations in favor of each state's appraisals of the estate that reveal an inability of one state to gain all of its tax and a sufficient showing of gravity to warrant the exercise of original jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.677" offset="9900622">It is not that Texas is unmindful of or unsympathetic with the plight faced by an estate such as the Hughes estate, faced with two competing tax officials trying to grab tax based on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.827" offset="9969167">But no more I would postulate than this Court is unsympathetic with that position, there simply is no constitutional impediment to states having domicile based inheritance taxes and pursuing in their own state courts the remedy against the estate and applying the tax against the estate if they can perfect and prove the basis of their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.894" offset="10077418">Should this Court be of the view that relief is merited for states so situated, I would suggest that the district court interpleader remedy is the most suitable remedy, and I would cover the reasons for that in just a few moments, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.540" offset="10176057">The district court interpleader as postulated by the Fifth Circuit does permit the least broad incursion, federal incursion into the state taxing machinery in inheritance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.080" offset="10242199">As the Court questioned counsel, in fact, with the disappearance of the county treasurer from the taxing scheme, that the case as postulated by the Fifth Circuit is not likely to repeat itself jurisdictionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.012" offset="10305938">More troublesome to the state of Texas is the suggestion that this is a 1251(a) case, or an appropriate an expeditious case for original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.397" offset="10355466">Simply, as Justice Stewart pointed out, in a domicile inheritance tax case, there are two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.737" offset="10396844">One is a determination of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.454" offset="10407711">The other is an assessment of and collection of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.703" offset="10420667">It is only when you have the domicile determination decided in a contradictory fashion by two or more states, and then you have an appraisal of the estate that is finite, an assessment of taxes by the federal government and these competing states, that you begin to get to the constitutional issue, and that is, is one state grabbing so many of the marbles that the other state can't satisfy its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.989" offset="10537800">And this estate is far from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.079" offset="10554205">The appraisals are not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.220" offset="10562773">Only the federal government has rendered its appraisal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.343" offset="11659289">On the question of the gravity necessary to reach this Court's original jurisdiction under either the original bill or under 1251(a), I would like to point out that the record in this case in conjunction with the record in the original bill and that of California v. Texas does indicate that California four years ago had entered into a provisional settlement agreement with the estate agreeing to only take an 18 percent tax as opposed to 24 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.937" offset="11809650">Now it postulates to this Court that it is being aggrieved at the level which requires the imposition of 1251(a) jurisdiction because it may, if quite a few different things as yet unresolved happen, only get 23 of its 24 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.914" offset="11885510">I simply point that out, that just because the fiscal matters are reduced to a finite conclusion, and just because a state may lose 1 percent, the Court should still examine whether that is of sufficient gravity to the estate... or to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.766" offset="11956981">Exactly the type of a gravity question that Justice Rehnquist pointed out in the recent case of Maryland versus Louisiana, that you must look to the gravity of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.260" offset="12010898">Furthermore, I would point out, in the Court looking at its original jurisdiction, under either Article III or Section 1251(a), there are alternate forms available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.255" offset="12058858">First of all, as we have pointed out, just this last August, an appearance by the state of California was allegedly made by the state... was allegedly made in the state probate court in Houston, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.876" offset="12109431">Therefore, at this very time, all the parties to this proceeding have appeared, we allege, in the Texas probate court, and that court has personal jurisdiction to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.401" offset="12159482">If not that forum, then certainly we have the alternate forums of the state courts in both California and Texas, which I ask you, as we asked you four years ago, to allow to proceed in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.192" offset="12218623">There is a policy reason, and I certainly wouldn't preach policy to this Court, but as I glean some of the reasons the Court has given for not exercising its original jurisdiction in the past, one that is especially relevant to a domicile determination that is such a heavily factual matter, the literal investigation of a man's life, this Court has pronounced that it is ill-equipped to sit as a factfinder at the trial level, it is ill-equipped to try such cases, and it could not accord to the litigants her what I would perceive to be their constitutional right to jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.873" offset="13201350">If this Court were to reverse the Fifth Circuit, it will then have a choice between an original... allowing an original suit and leaving California and Texas to their own state court proceedings with the attendant risk of inconsistent verdicts and taxation in excess of 100 percent of the estate assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.429" offset="13279613">Texas asks you to allow that latter course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.598" offset="13300302">Indeed, it views even a district court interpleader suit as a lesser intrusion upon state sovereignty than an original action here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.958" offset="13437706">There are several changes, although I certainly must say that... well, let me respond to it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.938" offset="13485667">First of all, these are the differences between what existed in 1978 and what exists today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.154" offset="13510535">First, if this Court reverses the Fifth Circuit, then you will know and we will know that there is no alternative remedy other than a suit in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.307" offset="13555152">Justice Brennan specifically wrote a concurring opinion in California versus Texas which made that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.492" offset="13575841">Secondly, there was at the time of the 1978 case, as Mr. Harrison said, the provisional settlement between California and Texas which Texas asserted here was collusive and made a number of points about it, and it elicited a number of questions from the Court which at least clouded the issue as to whether there was a present controversy between California and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.092" offset="13674271">That settlement, the conditions of that settlement were not satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.367" offset="13727351">You have an allegation which is entirely plausible based on the face of the tax rates that it is over 100 percent, and no evidence to suggest that the allegation is untrue, and that was enough in Texas versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.080" offset="13778238">I don't think you could ever have more until it is too late.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.687" offset="13812615">And finally, there were in 1978 a number of ancillary disputes which have since bean resolved, those disputes involving, for example, the so-called Mormon will, Mr. Dumar's famous will, the questions of airship, a claim by HHMI, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, that there was a will which had become lost, all of which affected the tax position, and which were urged by Texas in opposition to California versus Texas as problems affecting ripeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.564" offset="13940093">Those problems have been resolved in the trial courts, and in many instances are final.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.873" offset="14293373">--Yes, for the reasons set forth in our motion for leave to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.950" offset="14305702">There is an intensely practical reason why there is a controversy between states and will be even without the interpleader suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.697" offset="14340707">You might ask, well, what is the harm if there is no interpleader, and let California proceed, and let Texas proceed, and one can see what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.942" offset="14377696">The problem is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.503" offset="14387936">Almost immediately after Mr. Hughes died, Texas began a suit which ultimately resulted in a determination of a Texas domicile in the Texas state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.749" offset="14428896">California was required by its own law to wait until the estate filed its tax return, known as the IT 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.294" offset="14459093">That was not done for a year and a half roughly after Mr. Hughes died.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.902" offset="14473513">Only after the IT 22 was filed, under our law, does the administrative process begin which leads to the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.866" offset="14513324">By the time that judicial process was about to commence, an injunction had been entered by the district court which continues to this very day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.878" offset="14541431">But by then, Texas had its judgment, so these were not really parallel trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.846" offset="14561284">One is well ahead of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.250" offset="14566927">And as a practical matter, as we allege in Paragraph 26 of the proposed complaint, which is attached to the motion for leave to file, if the Fifth Circuit decision is reversed, and the stay is lifted, the Texas judgment could and undoubtedly would become final rather quickly, and Texas would then be in a position to execute that judgment, and so by the time California was able to complete its administrative and judicial process, the estate could and undoubtedly would be substantially depleted, and California might find very little left when it comes to perfect its own judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.236" offset="14710809">So, that course, from California's point of view, simply will not work, and there is thus an immediate threat to California posed by the Texas judgment, and that is what creates, in our view, the case or controversy proposed by our motion for leave to file, which would justify allowing an original suit to be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.728" offset="14792834">Justice O'Connor asked what, if anything, is different between now and 1978, and I think I have addressed those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.864" offset="14825330">There were also some questions about choice of law, and I think a brief comment would be in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.207" offset="14846751">Whether the controversy is resolved here or in a district court action, the Court would not need to resolve any choice of law problem unless there is a conflict of laws which is outcome determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.327" offset="14907146">There is no such conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.529" offset="14916027">At Pages 17 to 18 of our brief, in Footnote 22, we cite the relevant Texas and California authorities, and I think the Court will find that the law of California and Texas on domicile is--</text>
