            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132292">We will hear arguments first this morning in Union Labor Life Insurance Company against Pireno and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.700" offset="175028">Mr. Kennedy, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. T. Richard Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="15.510" offset="194254">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.024" offset="208361">These consolidated actions arise from a health insurance company's use of peer review in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.581" offset="250574">Specifically my client, Union Labor Life Insurance Company, referred certain claims for reimbursement for chiropractic treatment to a peer review committee of the Petitioner New York State Chiropractic Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.075" offset="320583">The referrals were necessary because the company in its experience was not familiar with the type of treatment rendered or the medical necessity of that treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.211" offset="373036">And since the policy specifically limits the coverage to treatment that is medically necessary and fees which are reasonable and customary within a particular community, it was necessary for my client to obtain professional advice from the peer review committee of the chiropractic association.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.421" offset="457882">Now, these terms of the policy which I mentioned are approved by the superintendent of insurance of the State of New York under extensive regulation of insurance in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.494" offset="506261">Peer review, chiropractic peer review, arose in the early 1970's at the time that New York State insurance law was amended to require health insurance companies to provide to policyholders reimbursement for chiropractic treatment as well as medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.330" offset="593510">And therefore it became necessary for the companies to honor all claims for chiropractic treatment and to obtain the professional advice which I had mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.121" offset="636769">Respondent Alexander Pireno, a licensed chiropractor in the State of New York, brought this action in 1976 under the Sherman Act, alleging conspiracy in restraint of trade in the peer review arrangement between the insurance company and the peer review committee of the state chiropractic association.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.878" offset="731750">After two years of extensive discovery in the case, it became obvious that the only activity of the peer review committee was advising the insurance company as to whether the treatment rendered was medically necessary or as to whether the fees charged were within the range of reasonable and customary charges in the particular community; and that Union Labor Life Insurance Company was using that advice in determining the amount of reimbursement to be provided to its policyholders in connection with their claims for chiropractic treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.468" offset="914085">Therefore, it became obvious that the Pireno claim was simply that the company was using this advice to interpret its policy and he was disputing the company's interpretation of the policy insofar as the amount of benefits to be provided to the insured.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. T. Richard Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="222.191" offset="1020978">Justice White, there were specific terms in the policy that limited the extent of the coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.924" offset="1047936">One of the limitations was that the treatment had to be medically necessary, and another was that the extent of reimbursement would only be for usual and customary fees and charges and reasonable charges within the community.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="245.745" offset="1115228">And are those two things precisely what the peer review committee's attention would be addressed to, the question, were the services necessary; and secondly, were the charges usual and customary?</text>

            <label>Mr. T. Richard Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="261.426" offset="1177921">Those were the usual questions, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.379" offset="1185758">There were additional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.112" offset="1192654">For example, the company does not provide reimbursement if the treatment is beyond the scope of the chiropractor's license to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.781" offset="1227345">Furthermore, if the treatment is the result of a job-related accident or injury there is no coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.121" offset="1260677">And sometimes it might be necessary for the company to obtain professional advice in respect to those matters.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="287.806" stopTime="293.570">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="287.806" offset="1283456">But those... would that aspect be the business of insurance?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="t_richard_kennedy" startTime="293.570" stopTime="355.684">
            <label>Mr. T. Richard Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="293.570" offset="1306548">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.992" offset="1312191">As long as it's the interpretation of the policy and relates to the extent of the insurer's obligations to the insured, we say it is the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.861" offset="1355659">Now, we therefore moved for summary judgment in the district court and that motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.764" offset="1387319">The district court held that, since peer review served to determine the precise extent of the insurance company's obligations to the policyholders and since it determined, it helped to determine, the rights of the insured under the policy, that this was what this Court has held the core of the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.253" offset="1493272">And this Court so held that in the National Securities case and in the Royal Drug case decided in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.985" offset="1524201">The court held also, the district court held also here, that this--</text>

            <text syncTime="355.684" offset="1555025">In your view, are they in effect appraisers in terms of the value of the services?</text>
            <text syncTime="363.790" offset="1587417">Do they function as appraisers, in other words?</text>

            <text syncTime="366.914" offset="1599851">--Mr. Chief Justice, I think there is an analogy there.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.679" offset="1610927">The appraiser is an expert in a sense with respect to, say, automobile damage and the reasonable cost of getting that damage repaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.237" offset="1657216">And so too are the chiropractors experts in the field of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.860" offset="1679681">And it would be unreasonable to expect the insurance company to have this medical expertise on its staff, and therefore it's necessary for them to go to these professionals to get this type of professional input.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.836" offset="3667600">Now, that's quite different than here, where the insurance company is only getting advice from the peer review committee and there is no fixing of fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="914.121" offset="3788703">The chiropractor can deal with the patient, charge whatever he would like to change, and deal on whatever terms he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.119" offset="3824752">That's quite different than at Royal Drug, where the participating pharmacy had to charge a specific charge set out in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.538" offset="3854428">There's no contract here for the purchase of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.784" offset="3871355">And even under a restrictive interpretation of McCarran-Ferguson we say this should be the business of insurance because it involves the spreading of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.874" offset="3907717">As the district court held here, this process determines to what extent the policyholder is going to have to bear the loss, the entire loss, or whether the insurance company is going to take a good part of that loss or the entire loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.632" offset="3986816">To the extent the insurance company takes the entire loss, then that risk and loss has to be spread among all policyholders in the form of higher premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.800" offset="4023492">Furthermore, peer review helps the insurance company determine what are the reasonable and customary charges that it's going to encounter in this field of its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.201" offset="4077095">A good part of underwriting is calculating not only the frequency, the number of times you're going to have a claim under the policy, but also calculating the likely magnitude of those losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.008" offset="4136236">And unless the insurance company gathers information, as it's doing here through the peer review committee, as to what the likely fees to be encountered are, then it has no way of estimating the amount of premium and rates that it should charge and file with the insurance department.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.824" offset="4571541">And the insurance company therefore has to gather information and has to go to professionals where it does not have that information, and that's what it's doing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.004" offset="6824236">Both Union Labor Life and the Chiropractic Association seek immunity for their conduct, claiming that it constitutes the business of insurance under Section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.261" offset="6913262">Our position on that, Mr. Chief Justice, would be that there would probably not be a violation, because it would all be in house and there would not be a conspiracy among chiropractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.334" offset="6953595">As to the McCarran-Ferguson issue, we think that Royal Drug expresses three tests for the business federal insurance: One is whether or not risk-spreading or underwriting are involved; the second is whether or not the relationship between the insurer and insured is involved; and the third is whether or not parties outside of the insurance industry are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.340" offset="7053592">Now, if it were an in-house chiropractor it would satisfy the third test, but not necessarily the first or second.</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.358" offset="7177621">As far as the McCarran-Ferguson Act is concerned, I think there probably is not much of a functional difference whether it's in-house or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.503" offset="7294232">And as Mr. Kennedy agreed, that kind of information is already available to them to base their decisions on claims on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.530" offset="7330385">So it's already done in-house to a large extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.905" offset="7339894">The peer review committee may have interests adverse to the insurance company, but we don't think they do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.135" offset="7368733">We contend that it is important to recognize, as this Court emphasized in Royal Drug, that when exemptions from the antitrust laws are sought they must be narrowly construed, and a statutory exemption should be limited to the scope that was clearly intended by Congress and to the market in which Congress intended to displace competition with regulation, here the insurance market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.266" offset="7477298">The market in which the chiropractors compete is the chiropractic market and that is where the restraint has occurred in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.194" offset="8516971">However, I still don't think that it would have been the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.021" offset="8528361">The legislative history of the McCarran-Ferguson Act shows that what Congress was concerned about were the competition and the stringent regulation in the insurance market, and it wished to preserve state regulation of the insurance market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.060" offset="8596488">It was not concerned, Congress was not concerned, with competition in the markets in which insurers function as buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.588" offset="8626581">When an insurer is dealing with providers, it's basically there as a buyer of goods and services, just as the Blue Shield plan in Royal Drug was a purchaser of services from the pharmacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.661" offset="8678930">So I believe that we must look to see whether the competition that's allegedly affected in the complaint is the competition that was intended to be displaced by regulation under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.201" offset="8740997">We think that there are... contend that there are several points on which this case is governed by and is similar to Royal Drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.761" offset="8775270">In the first place, it's an agreement with providers by the insurance company which the insurer enters into in order to contain its costs, just as the Blue Shield plan did in Royal Drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.380" offset="8825739">It might be part of the business of insurance companies to that extent, like other arrangements for the purchase of goods and services, but it's not the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.720" offset="8867116">This arrangement does not underwrite or spread risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.812" offset="8883521">The risks are spread by the policy itself which the insured purchases from the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.622" offset="8906718">But determinations later on about what the obligation of the insurance company is under that policy, or actually advice regarding that, do not underwrite or spread the risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.212" offset="8953112">This peer review arrangement does not concern the policyholder directly himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.397" offset="8977876">It doesn't relate to the contract between the insurer and the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.144" offset="8996788">And it involves parties outside of the insurance industry and outside of the contract between the provider and... between the insurer and the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.953" offset="9032001">We also would like to stress that there are a number of respects in which the provider agreements here are even less the business of insurance than they were in Royal Drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.040" offset="9088426">In the first place, Royal Drug concerned a Blue Shield plan whose policies themselves promised and provided the services that were being offered, that is a service benefit contract, whereas here only indemnity contracts are involved, money benefits to reimburse the insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.300" offset="9161464">The provider contracts in Royal Drug at least contemplated that some kind of provider agreements would be entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.532" offset="9186333">In fact, they were expressly requested by the union management who were involved in the group contracts that Blue Shield offered that had pharmacy agreements, whereas here the agreement with New York State Chiropractic Association is neither necessary nor related to the insurer's efforts to satisfy its obligations to its policyholders, because there are other means whereby the insurer could get the same kind of advice and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.677" offset="9294898">Finally, in this case the complaint alleges a conspiracy among the providers which arose outside of the insurance industry and sought to affect a non-insurance market, the market for chiropractic services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.782" offset="9351322">The providers agreed among themselves and then persuaded or were joined voluntarily by Union Labor Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.138" offset="9376818">And we think this makes this case even less the business of insurance than Royal Drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.918" offset="9395939">With respect to the state regulation issue, I would like to point out that, first, it would not be necessary to reach this issue in order to affirm the Second Circuit, but it has been briefed by the parties and we believe that New York State does not regulate peer review practices of chiropractors at all, and it does not regulate this particular practice to the extent that is required for McCarran-Ferguson immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.249" offset="9525193">Furthermore, the first section of... the first part of Section 2(b) is particularly appropriate, because there is no law of New York State that would be impaired or invalidated or superseded if peer review is simply made subject to federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.398" offset="9589872">Furthermore, because the peer review committee--</text>

            <label>Mr. B. Barry Grossman</label>
            <text syncTime="2745.135" offset="11112811">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Courts:</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.414" offset="11129948">The two courts below construed the complaint to allege a conspiracy which eliminated competition in the market for the services of chiropractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.518" offset="11190343">In the Government's brief we indicated why we think this alleged competitive restraint is not the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.748" offset="11227228">It doesn't satisfy any of the functional or analytical criteria articulated in this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.042" offset="11260455">Moreover, as we indicated in our brief, the challenged restraint in the chiropractic market does not satisfy the criteria established in either the opinion of the majority or that of the dissent in Royal Drug, this Court's most recent decision on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.659" offset="11338927">Now, in view of the short time available I wont try to repeat that brief in necessarily abbreviated form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.405" offset="11369856">Instead, I'd like to address the critical words "business of insurance" from a historical perspective, for after all the various criteria articulated by the courts, whether it's spreading risk or relationship to the policy, are but means to an end, and that end is of course to ascertain whether Congress intended a restraint of the type alleged here, namely in a provider market, a non-insurance market, to be entitled to the exemption that it had provided for the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.513" offset="11538294">The McCarran-Ferguson Act of course was passed in response to this Court's decision in Southeastern Underwriters, and there is considerable evidence that Congress was attempting to undo some, but not all, of the changes that that decision was thought to have brought about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.317" offset="11621468">In Southeastern Underwriters the majority held that the Sherman Act encompassed alleged restraints among insurers in the writing of insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.063" offset="11672459">All the members of the Court recognized that the interstate communications and transportation incidental to the writing of insurance policies were sufficient to fall within the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.448" offset="11726062">But Chief Justice Stone in his dissent sought to distinguish between the local and the interstate aspects of insurance company activities, and he referred to the former as the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.518" offset="11802339">And in developing his limited notion of the business of insurance which should be left to state primacy, the Chief Justice addressed the issue raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.544" offset="11862421">And I just direct the Court's attention to pages 570 and 7 of volume 322, where you will see that the Chief Justice stated that if contracts of insurance are in fact made the instrument of restraint in the marketing of goods or services, they are not beyond the reach of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.143" offset="11960850">Contracts not in themselves in interstate commerce may nevertheless be used as the means of its restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.499" offset="11998258">Similarly, Justice Jackson in his dissent expressed the view at page 587 that if competition in goods and services other than insurance were restrained by insurance company activities that conduct would be subject to the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.084" offset="12076625">Now, since the majority of the Court felt the Sherman Act applied to the actual writing of insurance policies, it can be assumed that they too deemed the federal law applicable to restraints in non-insurance markets effectuated through insurance company activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.576" offset="12162516">Thus it could be said that the entire Court in Southeastern Underwriters was of the view that conduct involving an insurance company would be subject to the Sherman Act if it restrained competition in non-insurance markets.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.768" offset="12267319">That was a view held by Justice Frankfurter, but he joined the dissent, Chief Justice Stone, which drew this distinction between insurance restraints and insurance transactions which result in a restraint in a non-insurance market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.448" offset="12346000">He joined that dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.839" offset="12355613">I think it is a fair statement to say that he thereby adopted the reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.101" offset="12372645">If not, then one member of the Court did not address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.332" offset="12393543">This unanimity or consensus I suggest is critical to ascertaining what Congress' intent was with respect to non-insurance restraints of the type alleged in this case, for it indicates the legal status quo ante to which the drafters of the McCarran Act looked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.167" offset="12488942">Now, we all realize that the legislative history reveals considerable disagreement as to how much of the exclusive power of insurance thought to reside in the states as a result of Paul v. Virginia should be returned to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.426" offset="12553934">Now, it's clear that Congress gave back some of that power, but not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.940" offset="12572011">But more important to the facts of this case is that there is nothing in the statutory language, the legislative reports, or the Congressional debates to indicate any Congressional intent to create a broader exemption from federal antitrust law for insurance-related activities than was thought to exist prior to Southeastern Underwriters; and that, since the Court's aversion to this distinction between insurance restraints and non-insurance restraints can be presumed to have been known to the Congress, this silence is extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.577" offset="12762496">For there is absolutely no evidence in any of the sources that I have referred to that Congress desired to expand the antitrust primacy of the states to include non-insurance goods and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.118" offset="12828743">On the contrary, they used the limited term "business of insurance" rather than some broader term, "business of insurers" or</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.086" offset="13932573">And the NAIC, we contend what they're saying today is not different from what they said in 1945 if the complete legislative history is reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.534" offset="13970398">I'd like to point out further what Justice Brennan cited in his dissent in the Royal Drug case, that Congress considered a bill which would have limited the business of insurance only to agreements among... agreements between insurance companies and related only to rate methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.339" offset="14053572">That was Senate Bill 12, introduced in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.586" offset="14070604">Senator O'Mahoney, who advocated the position of the Justice Department at that time, said that he sought vigorously to get that bill approved in Committee and on the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.753" offset="14123267">But it was not approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.142" offset="14128805">Congress instead chose to enact a broad exemption from the federal antitrust laws and that exemption is for the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.499" offset="14166212">And as this Court has held--</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.108" offset="14172690">Mr. Kennedy, with respect to the basic argument the Solicitor General made, do you contend that the McCarran Act does create an exemption that was broader than the area that was exempt from the antitrust laws before the Southeastern Underwriters case was decided?</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.896" offset="14255864">Well, prior to Southeastern Underwriters everyone had assumed that the antitrust laws didn't even apply to the business of insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.064" offset="14284494">No, but apparently his argument, as I understood it, is that the dissenters took the position that if the insurance companies restrained a non-insurance market, that then the antitrust laws would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.295" offset="14325454">Well, Your Honor, almost everything the insurance companies do affects the non-insurance market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.137" offset="14348756">For example, if my client here made a unilateral determination that they were only going to allow $100 as a reasonable fee for a certain type of chiropractic treatment, certainly that would have the same restraining effect on chiropractors charging their policyholders as is alleged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.958" offset="14420122">And if a company does make the determination as to what that reasonable fee should be, but instead of making an arbitrary decision it goes out and seeks professional advice as it's required to do, to get expert input, by the New York insurance law--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3588.622" offset="14486682">Well, of course a unilateral determination by the company wouldn't raise an antitrust problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.371" offset="14501729">But suppose all the insurance companies agreed on what fees they would... what costs they would reimburse, and therefore had restrained competition in a non-insurance market.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.329" offset="14605592">And indeed, the Justice Department has taken that position in amicus briefs filed in the Proctor case, I believe, and in the Quality Auto Body case as well, that if it's an agreement solely among insurance companies it is part of the business of insurance.</text>
