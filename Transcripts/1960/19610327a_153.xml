            <text syncTime="9.033" offset="139473">The writ in this particular matter covers two judgments, the petitioner, after separate trials, having been convicted of the federal statute relative to bank robberies and incidental crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.476" offset="205302">The question presented here arises from the fact that the petitioner, Coppola, made an oral and a written statement to federal officers while he was being illegally detained in the custody of the Buffalo Police Department in violation of Section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.508" offset="297357">The question presented here is as to whether or not that oral and written admission were admissible under the principle of Anderson against the United States in which case the McNabb rule of exclusion was applied to a statement made to a federal officer while be -- being illegally detained by the sheriff of the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.889" offset="394951">And a further question arises, namely, that irrespective of the collaboration and the working agreement that was mentioned in the Anderson case and was the basis for that particular decision, whether or not in the interest of fair play that the oral and the written statement were inadmissible because of the fact that they were held illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.050" offset="491604">That is, the petitioner was held illegally after an arrest on suspicion as well as being detained in violation of the code provision that I've just mentioned to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.287" offset="560567">It's not a coerced, no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.245" offset="568404">It's the illegal detention under the Anderson and the McNabb rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.749" offset="586376">There were two indictments returned against the petitioner and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.697" offset="602154">The first indictment charged that on February 15th of 1956, the petitioner and an individual by the name of D'Antuono, entered a branch bank of the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company in the City of Buffalo, New York and that they escaped with something in or around $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.583" offset="685746">The indictment charged the petitioner and D'Antuono when actually committing that particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.435" offset="713122">The second indictment that was returned at the same time had to do with a different date, namely October 2nd, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.534" offset="745514">It was a different bank, the Liberty Branch or a branch of the Liberty Bank of Buffalo and in that particular indictment, the petitioner was not accused of having perpetrated the robbery of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.010" offset="799431">That part of the indictment was directed against the same D'Antuono as well as three other individuals; John Roche, Millio, and Simmons, but there were three additional counts in that indictment that accused the defendant of aiding and abetting in that particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.974" offset="863274">As I said, there were two separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.266" offset="880410">The defendant was found guilty in both of them, was sentenced to 20 years, the second sentence to run consecutively -- consecutively with the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.615" offset="917817">Now, relative to the M. &amp; T. and I'd like to approach that in as much as the earliest in time, on February 15th of 1956, the M. &amp; T. Branch Bank was entered by two men, both of whom were masked.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.084" offset="987721">Money was taken and there was an escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.826" offset="1006634">As early as February 27th of 1956, that's approximately 12 days after, the petitioner was taken into custody by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the City of Buffalo, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.789" offset="1058565">And while he was merely held at their office, a telephone call was made to the officers of the bank instructing them that at the close of the business hours on that particular day that they should hold their employees in the same positions that they were in on February 15th when the holdup occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.353" offset="1128782">And after that arrangement was made, the petitioner was taken to the locale of the M. &amp; T. Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.741" offset="1154382">And when the F. B. I. men got him out there in the east side of the city, they handed him a silk stocking and told him to pull it over his face.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.476" offset="1189282">And after he had done that, the door was opened, and of course this was after the banking hours of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.300" offset="1212583">The door was opened and the F. B. I. gave him directions to hold his hand in this particular fashion to enter into the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.748" offset="1250408">And then, they directed him to follow their instructions which were the substance of what had been given to the F. B. I. by the employees of the bank on the 15th of February, 1956, the day the holdup occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.385" offset="1316864">As a result of it, the petitioner followed the instructions of the F. B. I. and he went around the bank, he approached the manager then the assistant manager, then the cashier's cages, he did certain things relative to drawers, and then he also followed their instructions until he got outside of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.015" offset="1391470">When they --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="322.318" offset="1392619">How long after the robbery did this occur, Mr. Mahoney?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_b_mahoney" startTime="324.634" stopTime="1044.667">
            <label>Mr. William B. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="324.634" offset="1401919">Approximately 12 days Your Honor, the difference between February 15th and February 27th of 1956. When he got outside of the bank, the petitioner was released by the F. B. I. Investigation, of course, as you can readily appreciate, followed from that particular time, but with no molestation as far as actual custody interrogation of the petitioner was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.094" offset="1519783">Now, as to the Liberty Bank, we have a situation where the petitioner was not an actual participant but nevertheless, he was accused of being an aider and an abetter.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.581" offset="1585716">When these cases came on for trial and they came on for trial, the first of them in July of 1957, we had testimony in the M. &amp; T. Bank case that emanated from witnesses, one of whom was a man by the name of Byars.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.666" offset="1661994">And Byars was a deputy sheriff of the County of Erie who was doing some undercover work for the F. B. I. and he testified as to some admissions that the petitioner had made to him concerning the M. &amp; T. or the Manufacturers and Traders Bank job and in addition to it, D'Antuono, the co-defendant in the M. &amp; T. job, testified for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.256" offset="1768364">And then Gordon Eddy and a man by the name of Jensen, two members of the F. B. I. testified after a preliminary hearing without the presence of the jury, testified as to an oral and a written confession that they secured from the petitioner in the Buffalo police headquarters on the night of January 10th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.656" offset="1858017">Now, that's approximately 11 months after the commission of the crime and approximately 10 1/2 months from the time that the petitioner had reenacted the crime at the direction of the F. B. I.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.523" offset="1905455">After the hearing without the presence of the jury, the Court decided as a matter of law that there was no illegal detention and just brushed aside the fact that Anderson against the United States, McNabb against the United States were not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.238" offset="1976299">In the Liberty Bank job, it was practically the same type of testimony, Byars again, the deputy sheriff having testified, D'Antuono, and again Eddy after an examination of Mr. Eddy out of the presence of the jury, the Court ruled as a matter of law that there was no unnecessary delay that there was no application of the Anderson Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.539" offset="2069504">Before a panel court in the Second Circuit, both judgments were reversed with one judge dissenting and they reversed on the grounds that the factual picture in the Coppola cases, both of them, that the confessions were improperly received in evidence under the authority of Anderson against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.312" offset="2172635">At that particular time, Judge Moore indicated a dissent in July of 1959 with the statement that an opinion would follow later.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.829" offset="2210670">That opinion was never handed down until December 4th of the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.283" offset="2228537">That was the same day that the Court of Appeals granted the application of the Government for a hearing en banc and that order was dated December the 4th, 1956, which was the date of Judge Moore's dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.741" offset="2306382">Before the Court en banc, which was made up at that time of five members, the Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court with two judges dissenting, Judges Waterman and Clark and they held that there was -- the Anderson rule was not applicable, and that what the F. B. I. members had done with the local police, were consistent with normal police procedure and affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.978" offset="2431248">Now, in addition to the factual picture here, I've referred to Byars the special deputy sheriff of the County of Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.575" offset="2477641">The testimony in the case shows that as early as November 5, 1956, which was approximately two months before the petitioner's arrest that Byars had conversed with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.442" offset="2545142">And that the petitioner had made the admission to Byars about complicity in the Manufacturers and Traders robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.683" offset="2582131">And that he was making written reports to the F. B. I. and the testimony is positive that throughout November and December of 1956, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had received a number of reports relative to the so-called admissions -- excuse me -- that had been made by the petitioner, Coppola, to Byars.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.469" offset="2677217">Now, as of January 7 of 1957, special agent Roche and I might say, Your Honors that the special agent Roche that I refer to is one of the three prime movers of the members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose conduct in the Anderson case was construed as making or carrying out a working arrangement with state police in the Anderson case itself, Roche having taken three of the statements in the Anderson case back in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.968" offset="2843251">Now, a special agent in charge of the Buffalo office and having Byars report in his possession of having as the proof shows here that Roche testified without the presence of the jury that we and the Buffalo police from the time of the robbery in February, 1956 up to and including January 7, when Roche contacted the Buffalo police, that we worked this case mutually.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.958" offset="2963205">Whenever we had a problem that we were confronted with, we assigned an agent and a police officer to work it out and they worked it out between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.626" offset="3013883">And in connection with that, the examination of Roche that was being conducted was so surprising to the Court and although the record has sufficiently close Your Honors that it never shows any inflection of a voice whatsoever, and I respectfully refer you to page 112 of the record and this was the examination that was being conducted by myself and it starts right at the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.578" offset="3129657">But Your Honors will notice at approximately the middle of the page while I'm examining this officer about the cooperation that occurred between February of 1956 and the time of the arrest which was January 10, 1957, I asked him, “And during the investigation, you would -- cooperated more or less with the local authorities and they with you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="781.332" offset="3228714">“That's correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="782.636" offset="3233938">Then I asked him, “When I say cooperated, you'd relay information to them” and here's his answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.573" offset="3261628">“Well, we worked very closely with the Detective Bureau of the Buffalo Police Department and we worked the case mutually.”</text>
            <text syncTime="796.281" offset="3288482">And you worked very closely and the Court exclaimed at that time to the agent on the stand, “What are you saying?”</text>
            <text syncTime="805.508" offset="3325367">In spite of the fact that the Court evidently was somewhat surprised at the utterances that were being made by special agent Roche of the F. B. I. at that time, you will find at page 113 and it's the second question from the top, “What was the type of your conduct?”</text>
            <text syncTime="826.487" offset="3409272">His answer is, “If we had any information we wanted to work on mutually, we would work with the detectives and we would assign a detective and an agent together to work it out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="837.808" offset="3454621">“And that was done relative to the M&amp;T stick up, was it not, ”answer, “Correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="844.055" offset="3479594">Now, that's the part that -- of the collaboration and the cooperation and the working arrangement that was in existence for a period of eight, nine, or 10 months from February 1956 up to and including January of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.295" offset="3540511">In addition to that, you have what I've referred to of Byars, the special deputy sheriff, that he had been making these written reports to the F. B. I. in November and December of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.851" offset="3594742">Now, we approach 1957, January.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.430" offset="3609057">On January the 5th of 1957, Roche contacts Chief Golombeck or Chief of Detectives Golombeck, of the Buffalo Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.809" offset="3646568">He makes a query of them as to whether or not, there's an unsolved crime on their books involving one Paul, that's all the information that was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.023" offset="3687424">Golombeck's retort was to the effect that yes, we have a situation on our book and for a -- relative to a Redlinski and with that information, then Roche at his office in the F. B. I. takes photographs of the petitioner and two others and takes them over the headquarters to Golombeck and at that particular time, there's testimony here coming from Golombeck to the effect that an identification was made by Redlinski of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.084" offset="3811662">Now, that was January 7th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.061" offset="3827649">In spite of the identification that appears in the record, nothing was done by the Buffalo police as far as the petitioner was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.317" offset="3860668">He wasn't bothered on the 7th.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.506" offset="3869445">He wasn't bothered on the 8th, nor on the 9th of January of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.414" offset="3905076">Not content with that, on January the 9th of 1957 and this is not stated to the Court as any criticism of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for making such a report, but on January 9th, 1957, Roche again calls Golombeck and tells him that we have some information that there's going to be a robbery tomorrow morning on the east side of the City of Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.305" offset="4040600">And in addition to Roche informing the -- Golombeck of that fact, he also testified that he went to the office of John Dwyer, the District Attorney of Erie County and informed him of the same fact and also told Mr. Dwyer that we are investigating Coppola, the petitioner, relative to the Manufacturers and Traders stickup in February, 1956 and the Liberty Bank stickup in October of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.787" offset="4166510">The following morning, Golombeck takes four or five different squads and fans them out around the eastside of the City of Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.923" offset="4207052">At approximately 10 am in the morning with a shotgun in the hands of one officer and with Golombeck and Harry Klenk, who is head the homicide squad, they ordered the petitioner and two others, D'Antuono and Simmons over to occur.</text>

Bank, the Liberty Bank, and the branch of the Marine Trust as it developed that there was some conversation between Byars and Coppola relative to an anticipated foray in the future involving the Marine Trust, but that has never materialized and this is the sole reference to it in the record itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.991" offset="6699342">Now, after Roche got into headquarters at approximately at noon time, his contacts were then with Golombeck, Chief of Detectives, Klenk, both of whom were the arresting officers, John Dwyer, the District Attorney of Erie County, who had been apprised the day before and when he found out that there had been no interrogation of Coppola at that particular time, then all four of them went to lunch.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.575" offset="6821700">Now, I say that that is a definite significant factor because unless you would want to take just one definite stand and say that it was merely a sociable gathering over that period of time from approximately noon until 2:30, I certainly think that that is a factor that can be taken into consideration by the Court as to a continuation of that working arrangement that was existent between Roche and his agents on the one hand and Golombeck and Klenk on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.370" offset="7472880">And in that questioning, Roche was concerned with the M. &amp; T. job and he was concerned with the Liberty Bank job, and he was also concerned as to whether or not he could get permission from the petitioner to affect the search of his home which was in Niagara Falls, some 26 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.790" offset="7566503">Now, that joint conference between these two men, the special agent Roche and the District Attorney ended at approximately 4:00 o'clock.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.049" offset="7659604">The United States Commissioners have no designated hours but they're generally there doing the regular business hours of the day and that would be 5:00 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.296" offset="7696593">What they did with Coppola at that particular time was to put him back in confinement and he stayed in confinement until approximately 9:00 o'clock, that particular night, this is January 10th of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.610" offset="7777782">At about 8:00 o'clock, special agent Roche assigned six deputies, two of whom were assigned to Coppola, to go to police headquarters for the purpose of getting a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.666" offset="7838072">And I might say at this particular time and I do urge this upon the Court that in as much as they had the written reports of Byars to the effect of an admission having been made by the defendant or by the petitioner as to both of these cases, it would seem to me that they were no longer investigating because they had more than sufficient proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.479" offset="7933262">That is the federal agents had more than sufficient proof in their possession where they could have gone over to a Commissioner on November the 5th, 1956 or up until the end of December of 1956 and secured a warrant for the arrest of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.027" offset="7995434">And they -- if their evidence was believable, it was more than sufficient to warrant a conviction on a question of fact in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.111" offset="8027826">But it would seem to me at this particular stage that when Roche engages in these calls of January 7th and 9th and then he's so active on January 10th, and then he assigns men to go over and interrogate Coppola, he's not interested in investigation of a crime nor is he interested in trying to absolve somebody who might be suspected but his sole interest on that basis or his sole interest is the basis of going over and getting a statement for the purpose of conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3701.457" offset="14909210">There came a time in the course of this investigation when the informant advised the F. B. I. that the petitioner and his accomplices were planning a state offense, the robbery of a tavern in Buffalo.</text>

            <text syncTime="5487.227" offset="22052237">Yes, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.836" offset="22066761">Now, the second point which petitioner makes here is one which assumes that there was no working arrangement, no cooperation, no joint investigation here such as would under the Anderson case, require exclusion of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.131" offset="22151920">This point urges that even though there been -- there has been no such cooperation that nevertheless the Court ought to hold that the confessions are inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.188" offset="22208136">Now, we submit that there is no basis in the decisions of this Court for such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.156" offset="22240005">Under that hypothesis, the McNabb-Mallory rule is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.728" offset="22262262">Federal agents have not disobeyed the mandate of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.566" offset="22289638">They have done nothing wrong at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.729" offset="22298311">They have taken the prisoner as they found him and they have interviewed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.988" offset="22319313">There's no basis for the application of the McNabb restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.310" offset="22344600">The Court has -- in dealing with evidence of this kind, this Court has never excluded this kind of evidence unless an exclusion was an implementation of a federal constitutional command, statutory or rule of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.522" offset="22421504">None of these is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.586" offset="22429759">Petitioner does not claim that he was deprived of any constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.788" offset="22450552">He does claim that he was -- that his detention violated a state rule of procedure and that would be the basis upon which he asked the Court to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.549" offset="22493602">Now the Court has never excluded evidence of this kind absent of violation of a federal constitutional command, statute or rule of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.365" offset="22540831">None of those are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5612.887" offset="22554937">The general rule at common law and as I've indicated in all of the state jurisdictions has been that a confession is nonetheless admissible despite any illegality in the detention which preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.244" offset="22612302">The test is one of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.217" offset="22624214">The illegal custody maybe a factor in determining whether the confession was voluntary, but no state jurisdiction has gone beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.853" offset="22662771">And indeed as we understand it, the rule in this Court prior to McNabb, the general common law rule on confessions was that a confession is inadmissible even if it is made while the prisoner is in custody so long as it is voluntary and meets the test of voluntariness and there's no issue here of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.667" offset="22750020">That question was not even raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.624" offset="22757857">It was submitted to the jury and resolved against petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.870" offset="22770813">He did not raise it in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.651" offset="22778023">He does not raise it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.723" offset="22786278">So this confession qualifies as admissible under the rules of all the states as far as we can tell, under the general common law principle regarding admissibility of confessions which this Court had -- had adhered to prior to the McNabb rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.154" offset="22855973">Now, if the circumstances do not call for application of the McNabb rule, that is if there is no finding here that federal officers in -- in someway were involved with the illegality and therefore should be disciplined by -- by an exclusion here, there's no basis as we see it upon which to exclude this confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="5970.965" offset="23987284">The Court has stated that the -- the fundamental purpose of the rule of exclusion is to prevent and not to repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.182" offset="24016123">Now, a rule of exclusion here would not serve any useful purpose by hypothesis on this branch of the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="5987.833" offset="24054680">If anything illegal has been done, it's been done by state officials who have been engaged in investigating an independent state crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.888" offset="24090937">A rule of exclusion here would not serve to encourage state police to adhere to their own local rules of procedure on the possibility that during their investigation of an unrelated state crime, a confession to a federal offense might be obtained from the prisoner which would be admissible in the state court, but which would not be admissible in the federal court under the extension of McNabb proposed here by petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="6046.090" offset="24287692">Once you eliminate McNabb and once you eliminate any deprivation of constitutional rights, we say that the Court is thrown back on the usual rule which applies to confessions, a rule which the States have applied and which this Court applied before it promulgated the McNabb rule as a means to enforce the mandate of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.897" offset="24402944">When you resort to the normal common law rules of evidence here which all the State applied as far as we can tell and which this Court applied prior to McNabb, the only basis upon which this confession maybe excluded is that it was involuntary and there is no contention that it was involuntary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.511" offset="24485386">That being so as we see it, there is no basis upon which the confession can be excluded.</text>
