            <text syncTime="15.717" offset="166222">This is a federal income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.810" offset="178657">It is before this Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims which dismissed petitioner's suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.926" offset="215124">Petitioner is the American Automobile Association, a nonstock membership corporation with its principal offices in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.823" offset="254621">Petitioner is a national organization which renders services to its affiliated local clubs and their members and performs services of a public nature and fields relating to motoring and travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.092" offset="311777">Separate books and records are maintained by petitioner with respect to its national activities and those activities are not involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.982" offset="355349">In addition, petitioner operates directly 10 local automobile clubs as divisions of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.913" offset="395055">Those clubs include the club which serves the metropolitan area of Washington, a club which serves South Florida, went in Texas, Wisconsin, Wyoming and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.376" offset="440926">Substantially, all of the income which petitioner derives from its divisions is paid in the form of dues prepaid by its members in advance, in consideration for services to be rendered by the club over the ensuing 12-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.868" offset="522846">Petitioner is obligated to render services over that ensuing 12-month period which include a complete travel service, trip planning, tour books, accommodation directories, maps, emergency road service, personal automobile accident insurance, bail bond protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.393" offset="600900">The obligation of petitioner necessarily includes the duty to maintain the staff and the facilities in -- which are adequate to permit it to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.060" offset="659623">The issue in this case is whether petitioner in computing its income for federal income tax purposes can account for prepaid dues as taxable income in accordance with sound principles of accrual accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.696" offset="718137">Or whether this Court, in Automobile Club of Michigan, intended to lay down a broad general rule of law that under no circumstances can prepaid receipts, be accounted for as taxable income later than the year in which received.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.028" offset="795460">And regardless of sound accounting -- accounting principles and irrespective of whether net income is clearly reflected, petitioner's entire argument will be directed toward establishing the point that this Court did not intend to lay down such a broad sweeping rule law in Automobile Club of Michigan on the accounting issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.120" offset="891904">And that therefore, the Michigan case should not be controlling here.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.706" offset="1674219">But the problem is acute and certainly, this Court should hold that in any case where it is absolutely essential in order to match the cost of performance with the prepaid revenue that you've got to defer.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.344" offset="1796786">While petitioner filed its tax returns on a calendar year basis, its members join in prepaid dues for 12-month period which does not coincide with petitioner's calendar year or taxable year but extends beyond in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.381" offset="1864913">In every case, the membership period extends beyond the petitioner's taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.467" offset="1885288">That single fact is the cause of the dispute and because of that fact, petitioner's method of accounting is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.868" offset="1918830">A member joins on July 1, prepays dues of $12.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.716" offset="1938265">Under petitioner's method of accounting, $6 of those prepaid dues are reflected as income in the year of receipt, the remaining $6 -- the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.531" offset="1977448">Respondent says no, in tactual of dollars, constitutes taxable income in the year of receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.849" offset="2006810">The difference in the two methods of accounting is best understood if we assume that cost of serving a member are $1 per member per month, in other words, an exact breakeven situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.797" offset="2070549">In -- under our method of accounting, if a member joins July 1, we have $6 of income, $6 of cost in the year the member joins, no profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.180" offset="2116106">The following year, we also have $6 of income, $6 of cost, no profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.997" offset="2139408">Under the respondent's method where a member joins July 1, we've got $12 of income, only $6 of cost and a fictitious profit of $6.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.395" offset="2176920">The situation is most appalling when the members joined in December and our members -- just as many joined in December as in the other month, under respondent's method of accounting, $12 of income in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.060" offset="2223626">We've incurred only $1 of cost in serving the member so we're required to pay a tax on a fictitious profit of $11.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.435" offset="2257063">Now, petitioner has established this effect in this case, not that its cost a $1 per member per month but that -- its costs are substantially in proportion to membership from month-to-month with reasonable constancy from year-to-year.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.543" offset="2325504">The exact cost per member per month, are shown in the record on pages 70 and 71 and they are quite uniform per member per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.038" offset="2367509">Petitioner in its case in the lower court went further than that and established as a fact that there is a precise matching of income and related cost in the same taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.085" offset="2423724">Finding of fact 26 is to the effect that if our advanced dues were recognized as income exactly as costs were incurred, the net income during the years in issue would be substantially the same as that reported by petitioner on its tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.969" offset="2499271">Now, despite those findings of fact, the Court of Claims felt and held that it was precluded from rendering a decision in favor of petitioner because this Court, in Automobile Club of Michigan, apparently intended to lay down a rule of law that such a method of accounting as -- as followed by petitioner is unacceptable for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.686" offset="2594147">In view of the position that the respondent takes in this case arguing that we violate the annual accounting requirements, I'd like to emphasize at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.427" offset="2641063">Under our method of accounting, we do not wait the termination of a membership to determine whether a profit or loss is earned on the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.801" offset="2674604">Instead, as of the end of the calendar year, we determine the profit and loss by reference to that portion of the contract which has expired within the calendar year.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.073" offset="2719640">Petitioner submits that its method of accounting should be and is acceptable for federal income tax purposes because it complies with the applicable statutes, complies with the Commissioner's own regulations and is in conformity with the principles of accrual accounting laid down by this Court under Section 446 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="674.702" offset="2802186">The statute not only permits but requires a taxpayer to file its federal income tax returns in accordance with the method of accounting employed in keeping its books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.006" offset="2847431">And the only two exceptions, 446 (b) state's them.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.223" offset="2864253">If no method of accounting is regularly employed or if the method of accounting fails to reflect income clearly then the Commissioner can substitute his own judgment and his own method.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.165" offset="2912005">But neither of those exceptions are applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.073" offset="2927679">Under Section 446 (c) of the Code, the accrual method of accounting is expressly authorized by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.705" offset="2958190">Section 451 which is entitled general rule with respect to year of inclusion of an item of gross income spells out that while in general, an item of gross income should be included in taxable income in the year received, it spells out the exception unless under the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer, it is properly accounted for as of a different period.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.661" offset="3066023">Certainly, a different period can be a period either before or after the year of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.294" offset="3088593">That is an express statutory authorization of accounting for prepaid receipts and a yet different from the year of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.117" offset="3123806">The Commissioner's regulations have for many, many years stated, “Approved standard methods of accounting are acceptable for federal income tax purposes as a general rule.”</text>
            <text syncTime="768.308" offset="3176573">That is the statement in the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.119" offset="3191829">Under the 1954 Code, a statement which says, the Commissioner's own regulations, a method of accounting which reflects the consistent application of generally accepted accounting principles were ordinary -- ordinarily be regarded as clearly reflecting income and therefore acceptable for federal income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.653" offset="3273958">Finding 22 -- finding of fact 22 in this case which is in the record on page 66 is to the effect that our method of accounting does conform with established accounting principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.098" offset="3339786">The decisions of this Court on accrual accounting with the possible exception of Michigan clearly support petitioner's position as early as United States v. Anderson, which is in 269 U.S. and was decided in 1926, this Court explained the purpose of accrual accounting in the following language after reviewing carefully the legislative history of the statute authorizing a taxpayer to use accrual accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.320" offset="3456606">Said this Court, “If the purpose of accrual accounting is to enable taxpayers to keep their books and records and to file their tax returns according to scientific accounting principles by charging against income earned during the taxable period, the expenses incurred in and properly attributable to the process of earning income during that period.”</text>
            <text syncTime="859.861" offset="3542810">Now, the finding of fact in our case conforms exactly with that language since it is found as a fact that there is a precise match of prepaid dues and related cost of serving members.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.701" offset="3598190">Second, the decisions of this Court from Spring City Foundry which is in 292 U.S. to the recent Hanson decision, point out that it is not the time of the actual receipt of cash that determines the year of its inclusion in income under accrual accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.027" offset="3691499">And the cases which have been decided by this Court on the subject of accrual accounting, cash generally has been received by the taxpayer in a year following that in which performance takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.779" offset="3742490">In our case, cash is received prior to performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.522" offset="3765478">The rules of accrual accounting are exactly the same whether or not cash precedes or follows performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.306" offset="3800586">In accordance with sound accounting principles, income under accrual accounting emerges only as goods to deliver or a services rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.710" offset="3838203">Now, what goes on line one of an income statement is the value of goods delivered or the value of services rendered, cash is ignored whether it comes into play before or after performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.848" offset="3898807">There are two interesting decisions precisely in point of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals which have followed the decision of this Court in Automobile Club of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.919" offset="3951052">First is the Bressner Radio case which was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.423" offset="3981040">That case involved prepaid television service contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.069" offset="3999640">The contract which -- a purchase of a television set would buy at the time he bought his set was to have the seller guarantee the fixer set over the ensuing 12-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.583" offset="4049690">These were in the days when sets were a little more fickle than they are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.712" offset="4066200">The contract was exactly for 12 months, the same as in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.389" offset="4080933">The taxpayer's obligation to perform in that case was only upon the demand of the member which is exactly the same as in our case, the method of accounting followed by the taxpayers in the Bressner case, substantially the same as in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.061" offset="4135581">The prepaid television service contract income was prorated over the period of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.617" offset="4157837">The Second Circuit reviewed in detail all of the decisions of this Court on the subject of accrual accounting and can -- and concluded that this Court in Michigan inferred that a realistic deferral would have been permissible for tax purposes if income were clearly reflected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.616" offset="4229831">The starting points, said the Court, was whether income was clearly reflected and it looked at all of these contracts, found a uniform cost on a monthly basis and conclude that it was absolutely essential for the taxpayer to employ sound accrual accounting in order to reflect its income clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.711" offset="4310183">Actually, the taxpayer was (Inaudible) in a loss but the Government was trying to collect an income tax because under its method of accounting of profit was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.786" offset="4338500">The Eighth Circuit subsequent to this Court's decision in Michigan has decided Schlude case which involves prepaid income received by dance studios in return for lessons to be given over more than a period of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.177" offset="4404120">The Eighth Circuit followed the Second Circuit, said, “Clearly, sound accrual accounting demands that prepaid receipts not be taken into income until the cost to incur of serving the member."</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.260" offset="4452394">The Beacon Publish Company case in the Tenth Circuit, involved exactly the same issue insofar as prepaid subscription income was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.309" offset="4496593">That case was decided before this Court's decision in Michigan and this Court in a footnote in the Michigan's case, said it was not really passing upon the principle laid down in the Beacon case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer</label>
            <text syncTime="1397.309" offset="5692583">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.893" offset="5706898">If I may, I would advert first to the discussion of Section 452, the legislative history about which Mr. Justice Harlan inquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.198" offset="5756113">We think that the contrast between the provision there proposed and then repealed by Congress, points out one of the dangers of position which the respondent offers to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.280" offset="5824449">452 did not merely provide no transitional mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.770" offset="5858408">452 on the other hand had some specific safeguards for the revenue and that it limited the number of years over which a taxpayer could defer prepaid income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.468" offset="5925282">It limited it to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.392" offset="5932910">If -- if the rule is adopted, posed by the taxpayer here, the three A's for example could sell a life membership or sell a three-year membership or sell a five-year membership and then it would severely tax this sound -- this sound accounting principles to figure how to allocate those prepaid dues over that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.146" offset="6051924">As far as Mr. Justice Whittaker's question about, “Does the Government lose anything?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.897" offset="6082957">The fact is that the Government loses the use of the money which would otherwise be paid by this taxpayer and all other taxpayers similarly situated if the taxpayer paid tax on realized income in the year in which we contend it was realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.276" offset="6176475">This means the use of the money does mean something from the fiscal position in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.377" offset="6204897">And it means something from the point of view of taxpayers but those taxpayers will have a great incentive to defer tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.209" offset="6240214">And that maybe not necessarily an issue in this case but it's an issue in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.751" offset="6274382">One of the thing the taxpayer suggests that there is no transition problem here because if -- the -- they're already using the method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.414" offset="6333001">The -- the revenue agents didn't audit them early in the game so that they got a head start.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.984" offset="6355257">Now, other taxpayers who are not so fortunate shall we say and who are not now using the -- the accounting method employed by the three A's are left in a position where they suffer -- would suffer discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.068" offset="6427669">This actually developed in the case of prepaid publishing expense or publisher prepaid subscription prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.206" offset="6464240">There, the -- there was a sort of a grandfather clause adopted, those who had been using the method of deferring prepaid subscriptions were allowed to continue to use that method and by a ruling of the Commissioner and this practice was ratified by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.040" offset="6543548">That left others who hadn't gotten away with it, if I may use that word, in a severely handicapped position and newspapers, who couldn't use this method, agitated for legislation and got legislation which put them in the same position as the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.939" offset="6615124">Incidentally, the -- just deal for a moment with that detail, it can be said that the prepaid subscription of a newspaper publisher is in somewhat different category from the prepaid dues here because a newspaper publisher knows as of the end of the year, how many subscribers he has and how many days there are in a year for example and therefore specifically, how many papers he will have to deliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.136" offset="6731943">He doesn't have to wait for the subscriber to call up and ask for the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.548" offset="6749602">Now, in the case of the three A's, there is no such specific obligation to take care of a particular member to the extent of a particular amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.813" offset="6806653">The member -- there is no liability as in that term -- that legal in that -- in a legal sense, the three A's has no liability to its member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.376" offset="6848867">It only has a contingent obligation to render some unpredicted and unpredictable amount of services to particular members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.674" offset="6894111">They have an experience that shows what the gross is but they don't have anything like the specificity that is required by the decisions of this Court for the accrual of an obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.193" offset="6952103">Now, this -- this brings me to what I believe is -- is the heart of the matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.978" offset="6979271">The three A's collects these prepaid dues during a particular tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.212" offset="7016260">This -- these dues are paid in cash money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.964" offset="7031202">They're deposited in the general banking account of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.987" offset="7055339">They're available to the corporation for all of its corporate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.083" offset="7071744">They can pay salaries, they can build a building, they can pay off the mortgage, they can do anything with this money that they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.504" offset="7101419">The taxpayer conceives and couldn't what conceive that this money when received and as of the end of the year which it is received, all of it, is taxable income in a classic concept of that word as it's been used by the courts, by the administrative agencies and is as used more -- most important in the statute, taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.329" offset="7204655">They have absolute dominion and control of that money as of the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.237" offset="7232345">Now, that doesn't mean that this taxpayer and every taxpayer using their accrual method for example, must pay tax on his gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.541" offset="7273514">If this taxpayer operating on the accrual method had an obligation which had the precision and the dignity of a liability, a liability to pay an item of deductible expense in the subsequent year, the taxpayer could deduct from the gross income of $15, the then value as of the end of the year of its obligation -- legal obligation to pay an amount in the subsequent year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.946" offset="7499107">As of the end of December -- as of December 31, in this case 1953, the year has ended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1921.719" offset="7790216">And there are other exceptions on account -- for instance, the statute permits someone who sells property on an installment basis to report on the installment method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.968" offset="7839222">There -- there is a provision in our regulations which is of long standing and we say has a dignity of a statute so that it isn't -- it's a statutory exception to the general rule which permits a construction contractor to defer the apportion of the profit or -- and in fact -- of course the gross income from a construction contract over the life of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.245" offset="7944338">I -- I can't philosophically account for that except to suggest that the -- that it's in the statute and -- and -- and so that I would modify what Mr. Bomar says about our statement on page 20 to say that in the absence of a statutory provision or a regulation which has the dignity of a statute, we do say that an amount of dues for example, paid in advance for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.399" offset="8060949">I -- I want to distinguish between services and a payment for goods but an amount paid in advance for services is by definition, compensation for services and in the -- if under Section 22 of the old code and I think it's 441 of the new, that is the specifically defined as gross income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2013.209" offset="8156244">That's correct but it is -- it is income and it take to come specifically to -- to what is -- what is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.467" offset="8201279">That is because the -- this taxpayer who receives this income is on the accrual basis and we have to have here as we do a taxpayer who can't quite make it in a -- for -- can't quite make a claim that the obligation on which he relies is an accrual entitling him to a deduction, that's crucial here because if there were a legal obligation of -- of -- with which -- which has some precision, the three A's could come in and would say, “Well, would -- would have filed their return on the accrual basis by taking the prepaid income in and by deducting an expense, an accrued expense representing the value of the obligation to render -- well, in this, we don't -- I don't concede that they could deduct it but they -- they don't come close to being able to deduct it in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.120" offset="8455816">Incidentally, there's a -- talking about clearly reflecting income, this is the kind of little gadget that develops when we spring off from the regular accrual method into this general accounting procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.499" offset="8517360">It's noted obscurely in our brief on page -- page 15 in a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.211" offset="8572217">That if the taxpayer had been able to find an accrued expense which it could deduct, it would have had all of the profit on this transaction on -- on its operations and it does make a profit towards here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.247" offset="8656332">All of its profit or its transactions for the year 1953 would've been taxable in 1953 because they would've taken all the prepaid expenses and the gross income and they could've only deducted the value as of December 31 of the obligation to pay to the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.612" offset="8737834">But by spreading the whole gross income over the two years, they pick up a little of the profit out of the first year and tuck it into the second year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.369" offset="8788825">I've -- I cite that as one point in for -- to support the proposition that this method does not clearly reflect income because under no stretch of the imagination that I can see can it be argued that this profit element in the case of a $15 payment of dues, the profit is somewhere between 25 and 50 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.584" offset="8897703">That will never be consumed in rendering services to members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.837" offset="8914735">It's in the bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.285" offset="8920482">The charter says that the members don't get a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.686" offset="8938141">This isn't income just collected under a claim of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.920" offset="8959039">There's no contest about it, its income period and there's no other way to describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.363" offset="8980773">And its income in the year in which the -- everything that happened has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.250" offset="9004387">So if -- if -- we had to -- if -- if we were just debating here which I think we're not, we were just debating a question of whether this method clearly reflects income, I think the Commissioner could stop right there and say it doesn't clearly reflect income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.207" offset="9700185">His tax liability for that year consists of the difference between the taxable gross income which is realized in cash, in hand, physically in his possession and the cash deductions for items at the expense of what she's paying out of pocket in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.258" offset="9800391">We say that the difference between the cash basis and the accrual-basis tax payer -- well, first of all, they're -- that what we -- we insist at -- that the annual accounting period applies to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.746" offset="9858382">This Court has said that many times that the principle of annual accounting applies equally to the cash-basis taxpayer and to the accrual-basis taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.477" offset="9897253">The difference is that if the taxpayer is on the accrual method, you measure his tax not precisely by what he has received in cash and what he has paid out in cash during the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.073" offset="9955662">You measure it in terms of what rights to income he's acquired during the year and what liabilities for the payment -- for the payment of expense he's incurred during the year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.469" offset="10025253">We get mixed up -- we -- we don't get -- want a way to avoid getting mixed up is to recognize that when a taxpayer has received compensation for services in cash, in hand, subject to his absolute dominion and control, he has the same or greater right to that income than he would have if all he had as of the end of the year was a promise of someone to pay him the dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.734" offset="10154297">The payment is an accrual in this -- when it's paid in advance because it -- there's nothing less to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.724" offset="10206229">And we -- we think that if you adopted any other rule which permitted the taxpayer and has accounted to roam at large in what are called general principles of good accounting practice and determine when those prepaid items are taxable according to when some good accountant or some bad accountant decides that the income has been earned in a sense of accounting that the Court would be exposing the revenue service to a very difficult and we think unnecessary burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.083" offset="13131734">First, there is no doubt about the fact that petitioner is obligated to render services to its members over the ensuing 12-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.172" offset="13168097">How our petition, paragraph 4, alleges that obligation, that's record, page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.830" offset="13190666">Record page 7, the Government concedes it so there's no doubt about the liability that we have to render services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.854" offset="13222745">If we don't -- if we refuse, clearly, a member could get his money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.371" offset="13244897">You're not involved with much money so undoubtedly, we don't get suits on that score often but they would legally be entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.138" offset="13279901">Second, insofar as the confusion that is in -- in the Government's brief from the point of view of equating the -- the problem of deductions with the problem of prepaid income, it helps to clarify my thinking if -- I referred to the example of an individual who orders a custom-built car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.659" offset="13378017">The maker says to him, “The cost is $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.249" offset="13392332">Since it's custom built, pay me now but I won't be -- I can't make it until next year and I cannot deliver it until next year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.231" offset="13436322">This Court has never decided the deductibility or -- of a reserve for estimated expenses where prepaid receipts are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.696" offset="13474147">Certainly, in that case, if the cost of making the car was $9000, either in accordance with sound accounting principle, the maker must set up a liability account for the advance and then take that money into come when the car is delivered.Or he must guess at what the cost of producing it is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.714" offset="13570278">One of the other two procedures is essential since the only off in it is what the Government contends for that the entire $10,000 is taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.930" offset="13611133">And when the Government contends that there is no provision in the code with respect to earning -- with earned income, it's a horrendous thought to think that income taxes are going to be computed on something other than net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.963" offset="13667244">The methods of accounting, the provisions of the code with respect to methods of accounting are inserted in the code to be certain that only net income is taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.028" offset="13707473">The choice of the accrual method of accounting is given to a taxpayer to permit a precise computation of net income rather than having to compute income on a cash receipts and disbursements method.</text>
