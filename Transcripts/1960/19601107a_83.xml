            <text syncTime="10.606" offset="145847">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.540" offset="165491">I represent the two petitioners, Max Carr and Ernest Gephardt.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.908" offset="190986">Max Carr was an Associate Professor of Music at the University of Arkansas, until he was discharged because of failure to comply with Act 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.951" offset="231215">Ernest Gephardt was a vocational printing instructor at Central High School in Little Rock until he was discharged for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.365" offset="272802">We filed separate suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.768" offset="282415">They were consolidated for trial in the Chancery Court and in the Supreme Court of Arkansas and the case is here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.804" offset="314598">Now, there are several facts in our case which I think is important to make clear at the outset which add something to the other case, the Shelton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.925" offset="391084">Carr and Gephardt did not refuse to file any affidavit, Carr being required to file an affirmation but in both cases, these two petitioners listed the professional organizations of which they were members, stated that they are not now and never have been, members of a subversive organization and offered to answer any questions touching upon their associations and activities which their administrative superiors might constitutionally ask them touching on their qualifications to continue teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.319" offset="572688">They refused to give the additional broad information required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.266" offset="608423">The record shows that no additional questions were asked of these or these teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.627" offset="649906">At the trial, the President of the University of Arkansas testified that he personally and the others in the administration wanted Carr to continue teaching that there had been no complaints about his teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.296" offset="724511">The same thing was true in the Gephardt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.354" offset="732766">The superintendent of schools of Little Rock testified that Gephardt's principal had recommended that his contract be renewed and that but for Act 10, he would be -- would continue to be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.000" offset="803401">Since I am sure that the respondents in this case will argue substantially what was argued by the appellees in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.962" offset="851257">I will proceed that both by making my argument and answering what I conceive to be erroneous contentions of what the applicable law is.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.277" offset="1384469">We do say, however, that there is a great difference in permitting school authorities to ask any conscious questions and having a broad blanket statute like this which is not limited in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.428" offset="1537128">It is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.172" offset="1544025">It is an unjustifiable invasion of individual rights and there is no compelling necessity shown to warrant such a -- a great invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.835" offset="1594702">Now, we alleged in our complaints and there is proof in the record that the real purpose of this statute was shown by two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.407" offset="1637021">The Governor's call, but particularly is addressed to the opening session of -- opening session of the second special session, made it plain that the purpose of the legislative session was to enact legislation as he put it to solve problems not of their own making but thrust upon us from the outside, namely by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.212" offset="1736182">Then there is, in the emergency clause, the declaration that the reason for the affidavits is to solve problems created by the Supreme Court's desegregation opinions in this -- in the school cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.591" offset="1809742">Now, it is our contention that true we cannot question the Governor's motives nor can we question the motives of individual legislators who voted, but if that emergency clause together with his address, setting the tone for the meeting and stating the purpose of the legislation shows what the purpose was as distinguished from the motive, we object to the equating of motive and purpose and we argue that under the decisions of this Court, there must be a compelling purpose which would justify the invasion which this statute makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.275" offset="1972433">Now, in the record -- I thought you were going to ask some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.281" offset="1996466">We allege in our complaint that the real purpose was to provide a vehicle whereby school teachers who had the temerity to advocate compliance with this Court's decision in the Brown case, would be made known and that they could be hounded out of their jobs.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.664" offset="3438007">The only thing in the record on the matter of necessity is the testimony of the president of the University of Arkansas when asked by the Attorney General whether this affidavit would be helpful to the university officials in screening applicants and the president said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.289" offset="3520554">Now, granted -- just because the president said no, doesn't mean that the Act is unconstitutional, but it does seem relevant on the issue of whether this is necessary when it is urged in justification for the broad affidavit thing that it is needed by those administering the school system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.467" offset="4321259">The other respondent is the Board of Trustees of the University of Arkansas, in this instance, represented by the Attorney General of Arkansas who has filed a brief in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.603" offset="4365772">The Assistant Attorney General is the present in the counsel table but has asked me to advise the Court that his differing argument to us in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.507" offset="4401403">I'd like to mention first Mr. Dunaway's argument that the -- the information contained in the affidavits is public information or it amounts to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.115" offset="4455842">Of course, the Attorney General's opinion is in the record in which he states that in his opinion, the information contained in -- in the affidavits is subject to such publication as the school board's in their discretion, might give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.594" offset="4521775">That opinion antedated the Supreme Court's opinion which authoritatively construed the meaning of Act 10 and the Supreme -- Supreme Court of Arkansas of course as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out -- Mr. Justice Whittaker pointed out, said that the permissible purpose of the statute is enlighten school boards alone and I think in light of that construction by the Supreme Court of Arkansas, it would be an ill-advised School Board that would give any other use to the information contained in these affidavits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.051" offset="4823542">Well, I -- I think that language that it need not be used in any other way preceded in the same paragraph, the language that the permissible purpose is to enlighten the school board alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.504" offset="4869413">And I -- I think the Court was working up to that that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.937" offset="4879130">It says the statute clearly doesn't require that that it be made public and that it need not be made public under the language of the statute and then the Court said, "The permissible purpose is to enlighten the school board alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.178" offset="4936077">That seems to -- the respondents in this case, the petitioners assumed too much throughout their brief, throughout their presentation in this because the assumption is and the argument just made is that discharge or the hounding of the academic people, public employees, school employees will necessarily follow compliance with Act 10, but there's no showing made in this record to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.758" offset="5050389">There's no showing such as there was in NAACP against Alabama or Bates against Little Rock that actually, any such harmful effects, objectionable activities came about as a result of disclosing the information that is required in Act 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.588" offset="5133772">The record does show that four people refused to execute the affidavit out of 800 in the Little Rock Public School System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.552" offset="5169612">The record shows that one professor at the University of Arkansas out of the entire staff there, refused to execute the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.978" offset="5203257">The record in the case just argued prior to this of course shows that no one in the Pine Law School District, no one in the Arkansas AM&amp;N College, refused to execute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.854" offset="5242755">So we have in the records in these two cases, only five persons out of some 16,000 as the record indicates, there are some 16,000 public school employees, classified employees, instruction employees in Arkansas, out of some 16,000, only five as far as this record reflects and as far as I know, had been directly affected to the extent that they have been -- their employment have been terminated for refusal to execute the affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.371" offset="7556890">And therefore, we did not have a situation at contract renewal time which is in May as the school term is approaching or close at the end of May.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.933" offset="7891153">I think that it should be pointed out to the Court that in order to accept the petitioners' position, that there will flow from the mere existence of Act 10 on the books and compliance with it, there will flow, these harmful effects of people leaving organizations of having their right to associate impinged upon and their privacy invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.054" offset="7979551">It'd be necessary for this Court to presume that the school board members and the members of the boards of trustees at various colleges in the State will violate their oaths to maintain and uphold the Constitution of the United States and put this information they gained through the State Act to an improper and under the decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas an impermissible use and that’s where that Court had ever made a presumption of that character with reference to prospective acts of public offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.074" offset="8123643">I guess the background of the facts with regard to what the operation of the Act has been for a period of two years that it hasn't, as far as the record shows, has any -- had the harmful effects that are predicted, that are feared by the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.948" offset="8199189">It seems appropriate to examine the position the school authorities would be in, in the event that the Act was struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.210" offset="8236178">Under the Act, they can and of course they are required to inquire into all organizational associations of School teachers and prospective school teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.246" offset="8284348">If the Court holds that they cannot do this because some of the organizations that would, thus be revealed or disclosed would be irrelevant -- membership and it would be irrelevant to the question of fitness and suitability to serve as a public school teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.161" offset="8347982">What position is the school board's and the board of trustees of the -- of the state colleges in at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.659" offset="8377971">Are they to request as I understood Mr. Dunaway to suggest and as the affidavit filed in these two cases by these two petitioners, the affidavit will say through themselves would seem to suggest to suggest that what they would prefer to do is the board asked the employee to list all associations to which he has become a member which he is associated that might be relevant to the question of his suitability and fitness as a teacher, in other words, allow the prospective public employee to make the determination of relevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.773" offset="8526451">On the other hand are they to request the employee to furnish information with regard to specific organizations that the school boards and there are some 422, I believe, that Arkansas have determined as a result of an extensive independent investigation that are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.063" offset="8623626">In other words, of the thousands of organizations that exist in Arkansas and every other state as each school board to be required to make an extensive examination to find out which organizations it would feel relevant to inquire of its employees if there -- if they are members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.899" offset="8694993">And both of those suggestions and both, I believe, been seriously advanced by the petitioners in this case, seem to be holding impractical and it does not say that they -- that any constitutional right requires placing a burden of this character of the second suggestion on the school board or making such a fruitless and impossible type of -- of requirement as to allow the employee to make his own decision on relevancy as the two petitioners in this case have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.411" offset="8836995">I would suggest in closing that the Supreme Court of Arkansas was correct in its analysis when it said we're not persuaded that the Constitution compels the board to ask scores or hundreds of questions one by one instead of making the blanket in, where it required in Act 10.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.106" offset="9759848">It seems to me that if this Act is sustained, the Court is going further than it ever has in permitting a very real indirect restraint on freedom of association which can be just as devastating to that right as a direct one.</text>
