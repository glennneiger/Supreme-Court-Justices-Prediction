            <text syncTime="26.855" offset="210840">On August the 3rd, 1958 in Dillon County, South Carolina, there occurred one of those crimes which generally engenders a great deal of passion in the local community.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.262" offset="632456">On August the 7th, 1958, the petitioner, Quincy Bullock was arrested at -- at his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.873" offset="670908">Bullock was arrested and taken to the Dillon County jail and was confined overnight in the Dillon County jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.425" offset="717093">He denied commission of the offense on the day of his arrest.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="161.384" offset="748857">Bullock was 46 years old at that time, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.267" offset="768397">On the following day, the sheriff and other officers of Dillon County, South Carolina went into the new jail of Dillon County and transferred Bullock over to the old jail which houses no prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.909" offset="858990">The record does not reveal any reason for this particular action on the part of the law enforcement authorities other than for questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.645" offset="909981">It is important to note that the old jail of Dillon County houses no prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.141" offset="939969">The questioning continued for more than an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.292" offset="964524">And Bullock later contended that he was brutally beaten by the police officers while he was in the old jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.243" offset="1012381">In fact, his contention was that a sheet was placed over his head and that he was brutally beaten and kicked on his chin.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.972" offset="1067238">After questioning in the old jail of Dillon County, Bullock was removed over to the judges' chambers, which adjourns the courtroom in the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.511" offset="1137455">The sheriff of Dillon County testified that in removing Bullock from the old jail over to the new jail, he was doing so far Bullock's protection and that a mob of some 200 or 300 persons had gathered around the old jail.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="283.156" offset="1235989">Is there any evidence as to whether or not Bullock knew that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="matthew_j_perry" startTime="288.304" stopTime="386.756">
            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="288.304" offset="1256573">No, sir, Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.284" offset="1264515">The evidence in fact, the testimony of Bullock appears to be that he did not see the 200 or 300 people there although it is difficult to understand why he didn't see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.636" offset="1313938">The sheriff and the other officers saw them and apparently removed Bullock for his own protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.190" offset="1348106">That appears to be a conflict in the testimony of the sheriff and of Quincy Bullock himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.516" offset="1385409">We think of course that the presence of -- of such a large number of persons around to the extent that the sheriff himself was concerned for the welfare of Bullock perhaps had its influence in the totality of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.922" offset="1459075">While in the judge's chambers adjoining the courtroom, Bullock saw his sister-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.969" offset="1507244">Now, the sister-in-law, though a member of his family was not there for the purpose of visiting Bullock or giving him comfort, but was brought in by the law enforcement officers for the purpose of reputing Bullock's assertion that he did not have a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.312" offset="1592613">And so, for all practical purposes, we submit that -- that her visit with him in the judge's chambers adjoining the courtroom was on -- in other than -- than friendly or social purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.882" offset="1678921">Thereafter, after questioning for an additional hour or two, Bullock was taken back into the county jail where he had been incarcerated overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.993" offset="1735346">And there, he saw and conversed with his wife, Mattie Bullock.Mattie Bullock was also under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.530" offset="1773484">In fact, in investigation of the same crime and so we again note that the fact that he saw Mattie Bullock, his wife, does not interfere with our contention that Bullock was in fact being held incommunicado.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.029" offset="1863450">After Mattie Bullock saw the defendant, then her testimony given at the trial was to the effect that when she saw her husband, his face was swollen to the point that his eye was almost closed and that he could not have walked.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.404" offset="1956968">Now, this testimony of Mattie Bullock is unchallenged in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.434" offset="1989151">It is recognized that the issue of -- of brutality generally is sharply contested by the sheriff and the law enforcement officers of Dillon County.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.279" offset="5336482">And of course, we make no -- no issue on it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.674" offset="5454033">And of course, South Carolina statute requires that -- that such a statement be included on any confession before it can be used in evidence against the accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.631" offset="14425945">At the outset, I would like to state that as a prosecuting officer in this case, Solicitor of the Fourth Judicial Executive of South Carolina, I am accompanied here by the Attorney General of the State of South Carolina and Sheriff Rogers of Dillon County, the sheriff who made the arrest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.840" offset="14510686">I would like to state to the Court the outset that if you afore brutality in law enforcement, you do not afore anymore than I do nor anymore than the Attorney General of South Carolina and the people of South Carolina and Sheriff Rogers, the sheriff in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.691" offset="14598144">We do not desire convictions in our State by means of brutality and if the Court determines from the record in this case that there is one single act of brutality uncontradicted, we, of course want this case reversed and sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.051" offset="14699604">Now, the position of the petitioner in this Court is simply this, that he was sentenced subjected to trial and had admitted an evidence against him by the State of South Carolina certain confessions that were extracted for him -- from him by means of force coercion, brutality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.629" offset="14801899">Now, of course, the question is what has this Court determined amounts to coercion either physical or mental and we, in our State attempt to enforce the law, do what is necessary to investigate crime properly, also read the decisions of this Court so that we may -- we hold the best of our ability remain within the limits of this coercion that this Court has set out</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.376" offset="14936900">And we have examined the cases cited by the petitioner of this Court commencing with Chambers against Florida in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.305" offset="14972635">That was a case in which the petitioner had been convicted in the State of Florida and confession was involved and that conviction would reversed on a showing undisputed, uncontradicted that the petitioners were subjected to five days of continuous questioning culminating in an all night session of questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.697" offset="15062183">The sheriff in that case testified that he participated in the questioning during the day, but was so exhausted at night that he had to stand beside and let others conduct the night questioning of the petitioner, which resulted in a confession.</text>
