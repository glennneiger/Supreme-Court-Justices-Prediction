            <text syncTime="23.272" offset="196420">There's one question I would like -- one more thing on this statement, then I'd like to drop it because I think that probably the integrity of the attorney is just not quite as important as the constitutional rights of our client.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.210" offset="244172">But let me say, since we've been permitted to go completely outside the record that when I got the Government's brief, I was a lot more indignant than I appear to be here now and I call Cliff Ramer who is the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.042" offset="295581">And I said, "Cliff, you know it isn't so."</text>
            <text syncTime="51.068" offset="307597">At first he said, "Well, John, he says that, "I think it's -- I think it's so."</text>
            <text syncTime="55.413" offset="325047">And I said, “Cliff, you know it isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.712" offset="334242">You weren't even in the courtroom.”</text>
            <text syncTime="59.165" offset="339989">And he said, "Well, I call all the agents together and they said it was so," and I said, "Cliff, I'm going to be before the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.479" offset="365275">I'll make an affidavit in front of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.984" offset="371336">You'd better be here."</text>
            <text syncTime="68.220" offset="376247">And that was a long time ago and there's no affidavit and there's no Cliff.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.171" offset="392025">That's all I have to say about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.581" offset="401742">As Judge Frankfurter says, there could be certain things that may not necessarily be that you're lying but sure, he's got to be upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.379" offset="452838">Anyhow, I think that the point that the Government makes about the constitutional rights of the -- petitioners were not involved since this was addressed to a specific place, with specific property can -- is answered because in the Ford Case a long, long time ago, probably the landmark case, that same objection was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.566" offset="569657">And I -- I don't know how well I remembered it, but I've got it written down as -- best, I remember it.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.853" offset="594735">Property as a property cannot offend forfeit.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.561" offset="613648">And I remember this word, "Unlade, evade taxes or the like but only men whose goods they are."</text>
            <text syncTime="135.040" offset="643532">And I think that's a sufficient answer to the Government's contention because it wasn't addressed to North Sales Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.167" offset="668087">They were not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.520" offset="677491">There had no cause to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.848" offset="682715">The property was theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.175" offset="696090">Mr. Friedman has given his definition of what at large means to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.778" offset="726497">Once again, I thought we were confined with the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.698" offset="738200">I'm going to adopt the definition of the Government's witness in -- in the record, which says, “At large means, you can do business anywhere."</text>
            <text syncTime="167.638" offset="773935">And these men weren't doing business anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.277" offset="784488">If you look throughout the record, I can name Plymouth, Benton, Vermont, Cucarola, Arrow all these different places.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.374" offset="832867">That's where they were doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.835" offset="838719">In addition, there were telephones that they had at Lampi's, Manning's, Burns, they use those telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.380" offset="868916">There wasn't one -- one proof that of depth was ever taken at 2300A State Street in the record or in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.838" offset="902771">And that's the business that they're talking about, the business of accepting wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.068" offset="919594">An old man's apartment is actually what it was, an old man's apartment and these fellows were there and they had their records there.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.180" offset="976123">There is -- Heckelbech says there's nothing wrong with doing business at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.157" offset="1004022">And he is the man that we're supposed to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.729" offset="1014262">And he says, "If there was -- if the -- the application was wrong, we would have sent it back."</text>
            <text syncTime="234.447" offset="1041115">But the Government by stipulation says that we -- the stamp was issued on this application.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.162" offset="1072044">And in our -- and the Government's accountants -- witness who was also the accountant of the petitioners stated that the application was never sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.574" offset="1113631">And I think if you look at page 13 of our appendix, you can see that there's enough time in there for an application to have been sent back if any corrections have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.405" offset="1153024">And there's -- the same exhibits since 1953, these "at Large" being crossed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.863" offset="1186774">And I -- at the -- at large -- the Government is tracking itself by the regulations and everything else, but now they're operating at large -- they permitted them to operate at large for about four years and all of a sudden, they determined that they wanted -- considered this an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.322" offset="1240691">They say that -- that there is -- it's an illegal to do business without registry.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.512" offset="1257409">There's nothing in the statute, the statute that says it's illegal to -- to do business without registering.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.860" offset="1282800">The statute says it is a condition precedent to do -- do business, you must pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.879" offset="1310908">And that's all the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.238" offset="1316342">And this Court said I think in (Inaudible), “You can't feed a statute by regulation."</text>
            <text syncTime="308.236" offset="1336299">And that's what they've attempted to do by the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.446" offset="1365138">Justice Frankfurter, you said you asked Mr. Waller a question and you said, “Well, you can't prove the substantive offense in the motion to suppress the evidence but this is one of the peculiar cases which occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.615" offset="1429817">There's no other case that I could think and I looked, and looked and looked.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.268" offset="1440475">You can't find another case in the books where you can go in on a search warrant and show the judge, this crime has not been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.518" offset="1469419">Most of them, it's the same crime in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.013" offset="1479450">They couldn't file this crime -- put this crime in an indictment because they knew it wasn't committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.245" offset="1496377">But we've proved to the judge that the crime wasn't committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.516" offset="1509439">And he whistled himself out of it by saying, “Well, it's -- it's the instrumentalities for the offense of -- of violating the 10% wagering tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="362.992" offset="1555310">And it couldn't be the instrumentality, I mean if we're going to argue instrumentality, it's my position that these were the private books and records and they're -- they're sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.497" offset="1601390">And you can't violate the Fifth Amendment by just changing name and saying they're instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.589" offset="1625736">But even if there were instrumentalities, what is an instrumentality?</text>
            <text syncTime="383.800" offset="1638588">The Government has been playing on words in saying, “It is an instrumentality and defining it by repeating the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.819" offset="1662621">An instrumentality means the means by which an offense has been committed."</text>
            <text syncTime="394.104" offset="1679757">What is the offense of -- of falsely filing?</text>
            <text syncTime="398.914" offset="1698983">When you filed that Form 730 and it's wrong, certainly that's the instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.148" offset="1716015">The offense has been committed and all of these other stuff is evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.171" offset="1736077">And the Government used this as evidence of private books and record.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.465" offset="1749243">And to me, you can't change the Constitution by -- by words that -- or misconstruing words and that's what the Government attempted to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.383" offset="2356955">Justice Douglas said in -- in one of his concurring opinions in -- in the Jones case that the magistrate must issue a warrant on all the known facts.</text>
