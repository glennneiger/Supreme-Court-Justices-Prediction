            <text syncTime="321.736" offset="1390320">On the other hand, it is probable that the precise question as to whether or not, there were three jurors in the Duncan case who had an express whether -- expressed an opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.163" offset="1463986">It's our contention that there were jurors in both the Baldonado and Moya cases as well as in the Duncan case, who have formed the opinions as the result of the publicity, there's the (Inaudible) District Attorney and who remained on the jury so that these defendants also were denied a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.828" offset="1986644">And in that respect, it is our position that the cases to be distinguished from a case which I argued before, some of Your Honors some time ago, the Strobel case in which there was -- once they had been by a prosecutor, Justice Clark wrote the opinion, Justice Frankfurter, and Justices Black, and Douglas dissented, be that as it may.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.147" offset="2063966">In that case there was one statement by a prosecutor made a long time prior to the trial and this Court took the view that the impact of that improper statement had dissipated prior to the actual trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.465" offset="2113181">In our -- it is our contention in this case that that is not so, but on the contrary, the impact continued probably because of the nature and the quality of the statements made by the prosecutor to the press and largely because he continued to make statements which were prejudicial and inflammatory throughout the three proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.695" offset="4250102">Well, when I say the rulings I am referring to, for instance, a statement made by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.944" offset="4283120">I'm referring to two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.723" offset="4290226">First, the statement made by a judge which according to the record was publicized widely in -- in the local press that, and I am paraphrasing it, that the suggestion that the citizens of Ventura County could not give a fair trial to these defendants was an insult to their integrity and insult to their integrity and we see that kind of a statement, I am not talking about rulings, I said rulings I misspoke myself, the kind of a statement made publicly obviously made -- may have had prejudicial effect with respect to all of the defendants who by that time hadn't been tried at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.265" offset="4476426">Moreover to answer Your Honor's question, affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.910" offset="4502967">When the jury returned its verdict in the Duncan case, he made a statement which appeared in the local press as a matter of utmost importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.319" offset="4568691">Generally commending, I'm not sure about the precise word now, the verdict in the -- in the Duncan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.130" offset="4603904">And moreover, when shortly thereafter, the after sentence was imposed, Baldonado was tried and the jury found him guilty after having been out purely, through imposed death sentence, after having deliberated on the matter less than two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.111" offset="4687809">The judge said to the jury and to the public and thence to the press, he complimented the jury and he congratulated them upon their courage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.578" offset="4737651">Now we think that kind of a thing may -- maybe a factor in having influenced the jury which three days thereafter was going to determine whether to send -- to send to gas chamber the third of these defendants, namely, Mr. Moya.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.567" offset="4805674">But however, the major point of our -- of our complaint is the matter of, if I'll use a shorthand phrase of trial by newspaper, but that's not an accurate phrase in this case because what all of these petitioners object to is not trial by newspaper (Inaudible) to trial by fair court and jury, but trial by prosecutor in the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.368" offset="4932838">And hence the problems which this Court had in Bridges and the Times cases and other cases to determine one point at what point a newspaper opens against the law by virtue of publications which have a tendency to do affect the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.638" offset="5013922">That is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.309" offset="5024580">The issue in this case is whether or not the State of California through one of its agencies, namely the District Attorney of Ventura County, intentionally or otherwise, it makes much difference, resorted to the press and made prejudicial and inflammatory statements to the press, calculated the prejudice the community against these defendants as the result of which conduct by the District Attorney, these defendants did not get in Ventura County in California that kind of fair trial which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment accords to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.155" offset="5200018">And so I turn then with the expectation of giving Your Honors some specific details or certainly not all of them because the statements by the District Attorney and law enforcement officers on this control are very many.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.156" offset="5263966">They are outlined in our briefs and needless to say, I do not have the time and shouldn't take the time to outline them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.917" offset="5291029">But I do want to indicate some of them to give Your Honor some examples of -- of the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.598" offset="5325720">Let me -- before I come to that, let's make a further argument or conclusion or state my own opinion and then I shall develop the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.105" offset="5367829">As we understand it, the Constitution accords to all the right to one trial and to a fair one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.085" offset="5403669">We think in this case these defendants, these petitioners, received two trials, neither of which was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.004" offset="5435434">The first trial was in the public press, a trial in which the District Attorney acted as prosecutor and the second trial was before a court and jury which we think was only a trial in -- in really no more than in form, a trial which merely registered or recorded the verdict which had already been reached by the community from which the jurors who tried these defendants were selected and that therefore, though I hope I'm not overstating it, that what happened in these cases was that the verdict had already been sealed against these defendants in the community and the court proceeding was merely the form of -- of opening up the verdict --</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.447" offset="14557184">I am now going to concern myself with four jurors, named, Porter, Barice, Sabadra and Flynn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.853" offset="14586755">Now (Inaudible) the testimony on voir dire, this is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.162" offset="14616012">With respect to juror Porter, as a result of discussions with specific people, 20, 15, or 20 people, and from what he read, he believed that the petitioner, that Mrs. Duncan was guilty, that the opinion was such, that the evidence, that evidence would be required to overcome it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.539" offset="14705560">And that if his wife or a member of his family were on trial for the same offense, he wouldn't trust the fate of his wife or member of the family with jurors or to the judgment of jurors who were in the same frame of mind if he -- that he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.076" offset="14771702">Now undoubtedly, that juror was uncon -- or constitutionally disqualified from sitting, both under the so-called rehabilitation statute to which reference is made in the -- both briefs, and under the federal criteria established by decisions of this Court going back many years, I don't have to press that point at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.800" offset="14858533">Now with juror Sabadra, the second of the four jurors, practically the same hypothesis existed with the additional fact that outside of the courtroom she had expressed her opinion of guilt and that becomes material and important because of the criteria this Court and these cases to which I just referred well at the rehabilitation statute of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.736" offset="14966366">Juror Flynn had indicated his belief of the defendant's guilt from discussions with persons from what he had read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.127" offset="15007848">He believed the defendant to be guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.888" offset="15014954">He had discussed the case with many people, possibly some of them might have been witnesses or potential witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.320" offset="15040658">The same hypothesis exists with juror Barice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.300" offset="15060616">Now these jurors had entered the box with opinions as to the defendant's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.133" offset="15095933">On initial examination, they maintained those opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.017" offset="15115473">They stated there -- a close reading or a close analysis of the voir dire examination would indicate the solidity or practical -- practically a solidity of feeling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3768.509" offset="15177435">Now the District Attorney apparently under the guise of rehabilitation under Section 1076 of the California Penal Code posed some questions to these four jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.969" offset="15239293">The questions were leading questions and not only were they leading questions but they were framed in such manner that if the answers were not given as suggested the juror would hold themselves out to be an irresponsible and unmoral citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.070" offset="15311600">And I have set forth on pages 32 and 33 and 34 and 35 of the opening brief, the type of question that the District Attorney had propounded to allude to obtain a declaration from these witnesses under the Section 1076 that they could sit impartially and decide the case pursuant to the instructions of the Court.</text>
