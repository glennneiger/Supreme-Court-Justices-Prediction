            <text syncTime="10.402" offset="145011">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.854" offset="158804">At the conclusion of the session yesterday, I had touched on most of the facts I think that bore on the first issue of alleged tie-in of equipment to patent licenses but there are some facts which I would like to bring before the Court that I had no chance to mention yesterday and to pursue that argument briefly and then go to the other points in the order in which they appear in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.614" offset="249814">The Ransburg Company, as soon as it had had about a year and a half experience with its number two system or process had a cost accounting study made by the firm of Ernst &amp; Ernst, nationally known cost accountants to determine what the proper differential would be if it were to be asked by anyone for one of these licenses without its equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.277" offset="348453">And that differential was determined in such way that the Ransburg Company issued a pricing schedule available to anyone who wanted it in which it eliminated from the initial fee which would otherwise be payable if the equipment reference to license, 60% of that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.479" offset="429328">That was the equivalent of about 150% of the full cost including burden and profit on the equipment which Ransburg furnished when the users wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.510" offset="473422">So that was completely taken out to permit anybody else to furnish equipment under one of these pure licenses if anyone had been so inclined.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.576" offset="505710">The monthly fees were likewise revised to eliminate all of the element of rent and all of the element of replacing defective parts, which was one -- which was the continuing Ransburg obligation in the equipment license.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.131" offset="559940">Now, when those --</text>

            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="563911">Well, how many outstanding licenses were there at that time, Mr. Gilliom?</text>

          <turn speaker="elbert_r_gilliom" startTime="135.368" stopTime="273.067">
            <label>Mr. Elbert R. Gilliom</label>
            <text syncTime="135.368" offset="644890">Since that time, those that are still in effect, I think total to about 337.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.844" offset="674774">There have been more issued but some of them of course have been terminated by the users when their operations changed for some such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.450" offset="701210">But I think about 337 would be the total.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.401" offset="716988">Now, the -- there was no evidence which was introduced by Binks or otherwise before the trial court that questioned the sufficiency of that price differential and the trial court found that it was a due and proper allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.108" offset="771845">Now, I'd like to come to the contention of the Government at this point with respect to this alleged tie-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.812" offset="798595">The Government's memorandum starts out with the assumption on page 3 that there was tie-in in the prohibited sense prior to 1953, and that these letters which were written to Ransburg's licensees in the 1953 were an ineffective attempt at a purge.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.853" offset="878738">As I stated in answer to -- to one of Mr. Justice Douglas' questions yesterday, we have not taken the position at any time that these efforts to inform prospective licensees and present licensees in 1953 that these non-equipment licenses were available, was any attempt at a purge.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.136" offset="959927">There was no occasion for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.054" offset="967555">There was no change in the company's policy at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.155" offset="979989">And the trial court so found in finding 65 that it had always been the policy of Ransburg that anyone who might wish a pure license without equipment, installation, supervision or replacement of defective parts could have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.893" offset="1042996">He had to pay for none of those things if he wanted to get them elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.679" offset="1058043">And the testimony of the salesmen whom -- whose deposition Binks took was very clear on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.885" offset="1090957">Mr. Pleva said, this is in volume 1 of the record at page 627.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.837" offset="1118751">“I have never really tried to sell anyone on taking the license without equipment but I always told them it was available that way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="263.356" offset="1156786">In other words, he did not limit that to post-1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.181" offset="1176116">That had always been the policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.581" offset="1245706">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.591" offset="1249782">There was no licensee or prospective licensee that testified by deposition or otherwise after most extensive discovered proceedings in which all of the customer files were opened to Binks that he was forced to require to take anything in order to get a license under the patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.769" offset="1326477">Therefore, the assumption that the Government makes is entirely unwarranted and the trial court found that the fact was just the opposite and there was no tie-in prior to 1953 and there was no occasion of course for a purge.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.588" offset="1381752">I'd like to touch briefly now on this -- on the decision in B.B. Chemical Company versus Ellis.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.758" offset="1406412">Mr. Justice Douglas asked a question about that yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.101" offset="1419786">In that case, the Court will recall, the conclusion was reached that the patent owner who had a patent on a process of making insoles for shoes involving a certain cemented webbing, followed a practice of not issuing written licenses to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.250" offset="1496377">A license went by implication when he sold his material to the shoe manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.857" offset="1522813">And that conduct, the Court found was within the -- the Leitch doctrine and the Carbice doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.546" offset="1545592">In other words, no choice was given to the prospect except to buy that material to get the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.447" offset="1573177">Now, there was in the Court of Appeals an argument made at that late stage that if somebody had wanted an -- a license without the materials, they would have been willing to grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.709" offset="1622183">But the Court of Appeals said that this comes too late, that to say that of this stage of the game because that raises the question of whether when you take into account the subtleties of cost accounting, the license would be a realistic alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.078" offset="1687698">In other words, the competitor might be placed at a disadvantage as that Court said by the fact that the patent owner would not make the terms equivalent to the terms under which the patent owner itself with franchise materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.099" offset="1755721">Now in this case by contrast, long before this case was tried, this policy was established, the cost accounting study was made and an adequate differential was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.772" offset="1810474">So I think the case is clearly distinguishable on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.978" offset="1827297">The Government relies largely in its brief on page 3 in support of its argument, upon the proposition, and I might say the Government has not made any contention if there was any tie-in after 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.320" offset="1888632">They relate their charge entirely to the period from the middle 1951 to --</text>

            <text syncTime="845.834" offset="3486699">There was a -- a letter written to those who had already entered into agreements that -- but haven't made their payments of their initial fees saying, “If you would prefer not to take this equipment, you can have the license and your initial fee will be appropriately reduced in giving the amount in the same way of the monthly fee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="862.446" offset="3553155">Those customers who already have equipment and had paid for it and were using it, there was no offer to rebate any of the initial fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.669" offset="3594010">Those licenses had been in effect of course for various terms from almost two years on down and it was felt that the initial fee had been earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.561" offset="3629641">But the customers were told clearly that for any reason they would prefer to change equipment and reduce their monthly fees which were the important aspect of this in the manufactures program that that could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.491" offset="3677288">This was not done, however, in any spirit by Ransburg that those people had originally been forced to require to take equipment because the policy had been clear at the time of those licenses were entered into.</text>

            <text syncTime="941.660" offset="3869968">From thereon however, before anybody entered into a license, he got a letter specifically stating what was available.</text>

            <text syncTime="963.511" offset="3957426">The fact is that they all wanted the equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.906" offset="4162957">He didn't want a piece of paper, he couldn't paint with just a license and he wanted the equipment from someone who had experience in furnishing it and that he saw, worked in their laboratory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.576" offset="6633723">Surely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.580" offset="6681684">Oh, as I say, these -- these manufactures, in order to have a working system wanted Ransburg to furnish an outfit that would operate the way they have seen it operate in the laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.135" offset="6727868">And this fact is -- I think accented by the fact it's found by the trail court that after these people had been told in 1953 that they could have a licensee either way, 55 of the people who got those letters with full knowledge of it entered into a total of 97 license agreements after that and in every instance, elected to take the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.814" offset="6826611">Now, the time is running so I must go on to I think the next question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.949" offset="6851166">The Binks Company -- I want to say first one more fact with respect to these licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.103" offset="6879796">The Binks Company is the first company that indicated any desire to furnish airless electrostatic spray painting equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.254" offset="6912397">After the Ford Motor Company asked them to make a quote on a unit played in 1955, they did that in January or March.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.508" offset="6941445">In January, and again I think in March of 1956 and they quoted on it, subject to Ford indemnifying Binks against liability for infringing the Ransburg patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.343" offset="6996720">Of course, Ford did not buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.614" offset="7005811">Then Binks came to Ransburg and asked for a license to make and sell under the Starkey and Ransburg process patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.697" offset="7038203">That license -- license was declined by Ransburg for the reason that it would have treated many of the customers unfairly and it did say through Binks, however, “We want you to know that licenses are available to your customers to use our method.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.650" offset="7109987">In other words, it would put Binks' customers on the same footing exactly as the Ransburg licensees so that they could use the Binks' equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.343" offset="7148753">And the court below made an expressed finding along that line and we feel that the findings of the Court with respect to this alleged tie-in are amply supported by the evidence and should stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.215" offset="7200266">Now, going to the second question raised by the petitioner, the alleged tie-in of -- of one license to another or package licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.754" offset="7258363">The contention was made that since the Ransburg contract does not list patent numbers, that it has the effect of forcing the licensee to take a license under patents that he doesn't want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.724" offset="7306219">I think it is sufficient to say that this license does not list patent number simply because of the fact these systems are designed individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.680" offset="7346134">And after a system is designed and identified in a drawing, the user gets the right to use all Ransburg patents, applications or inventions whether the patents have issued or not that are applicable to that particular system, and he does not get a license or paid for a license under any patent that does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.279" offset="7420531">And the Court found in finding 71 that there had never been any request for a license under a specific patent and no one had ever been forced to take a license under any patent which he did not want, so that the rule in American Security Company would not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.950" offset="7515199">I think the gross volume at the present time is about -- the record shows was $2.5 million a year from these licenses at the time of trial, it's slightly more than that now as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.044" offset="7575594">Now, going to the license-back clause, this is the third issue raised by the petitioner and one in which the Government has taken an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.025" offset="7611434">The Government contends that this was -- this type of clause could be illegal if it had the effect of perpetuating the effective life from a basic patent on page 8 of their memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.328" offset="7664724">Now, this license-back clause had no such effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.131" offset="7675904">In the first place, it did not require the licensees to convey their inventions to Ransburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.992" offset="7715297">It simply required during the early period of the field experience and the number of due process when technical information was being freely exchanged by Ransburg with these licensees in an effort to bring this -- this process to its best application in all faces of industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.634" offset="7789902">During that earlier period, it was felt by Ransburg that any improvements made by these licensees that had the benefit of that early experience and there know-how should be shared by Ransburg and the other licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.319" offset="7852596">To do that, a license-back clause of a restricted nature was used only during those early years, about three and a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.597" offset="7885720">It was for a non-exquisite license where the right to sublicense and was royalty free and applied only in this particular field of the basic patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.137" offset="7923963">Therefore, whoever might have developed an improvement and it turned out that none were, no right was ever acquired by this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.977" offset="7955310">But whoever might have developed an improvement would have had the right to use it himself, he would have had the exclusive right to it except in this particular field and the only effect would be that Ransburg and its other licensees could use it also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.852" offset="8014764">It would not have prolonged the monopoly of the basic patents because at the time the basic patents expired, Ransburg and the user who developed the improvement would be on the same footing with respect to the use of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.864" offset="8074846">So we feel that it was for a reasonable purpose and it was for a reasonable period, it was eliminated from the forms in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.067" offset="8111626">And that it was a -- a reasonable scope and that it involved only improvements in the field of the basic patents and that the license was reasonable because it was usable only in the field of the basic patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.962" offset="8163244">And as I say, there were -- had been no right acquired under it by Ransburg and the only time that one was tendered, it was declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.160" offset="8196054">Now, the statement was made in petitioner's brief for the time in this case that some of these are still in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.707" offset="8222177">The fact is that in September 1959, all of the one -- of the old provisions in contracts that have been entered into prior to 1955 were cancelled by letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2088.013" offset="8455398">That report said, the grant-back of exclusive licenses should be subject to close scrutiny but “on the other hand, grant-back of a non-exclusive license, as in this case, especially with author -- with the authority to sublicense may defuse the benefits to all licensees and thus tend to encourage competitive use of the innovations."</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.187" offset="8688097">I think the point is that rather than permitting someone simply to sit-on an improvement, this type of thing results in its being used by more people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.979" offset="8731251">I want to go briefly to the fourth question which is raised by the petition and that is the alleged fraud in the procurement of these Ransburg patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.156" offset="8775973">Reliance is placed on two affidavits that were filed to the patent office in March 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.625" offset="8801886">In those affidavits which were for the purpose of showing the commercial success of the inventions as Ransburg had commercialized them in the number due process, the petitioner says that it was misrepresented that these commercial systems use stationary heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.526" offset="8881507">If the Court will examine the Haworth in his big affidavits which were in record 4, pages 637 to 642.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.977" offset="8911287">It will be found that there was no such representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.592" offset="8925706">The affidavits referred to the number two system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.256" offset="8936364">The number two system at that time in 1953 was well-known to industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.087" offset="8955695">The brochures describing these rotating heads had been distributed at the rate of some 10,000 a year and the patent office itself had received a copy of that brochure which is Exhibit IIII in this case, a year and a half before this occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.505" offset="9029360">So that not only was it proper to furnish this -- these affidavits but no one was misled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.842" offset="9066768">The inventions of these patents were not limited to stationary heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.547" offset="9089546">The claims were broader than that and fully encompassed, the commercial systems as Ransburg Marketing Co. (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.237" offset="9120371">That was found by both of the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.643" offset="9133955">In conclusion, if the Court please, we feel that in marketing its processes, Ransburg has followed the rules of this Court and the rules of the statutes assiduously and that it has done what the patent system and that Congress have contemplated be -- be done when you have a -- an invention of valued industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.221" offset="9240221">In other words, it has licensed its inventions and it has left others free to come in and furnish the equipment on a basis which is comparable to its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.356" offset="9300825">None of these practices gauged separately, is unlawful under any test laid down by this Curt or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.257" offset="9332381">And in their totality, they have not gone beyond what the legitimate patent monopoly has provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.402" offset="9364982">We feel that the Ransburg program is one which illustrates the legitimate things that may be done under our patent laws today to bring a significant improvement to industry which is small manufacture worked out in solving his own pinning problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.451" offset="9437184">And that he is entitled to compete aggressively but lawfully with Binks and all the others who are in the same field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.708" offset="9478248">And he is willing to issue licenses to anyone to use the process and they can get their equipment anywhere they wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.032" offset="9511476">They are not forced to take anything in order to get those licenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2580.099" offset="10423777">As for the question of -- of Mr. Gilliom about active discouragement, there was active discouragement in the Web Carr correspondents in the record, volume 2, page 823.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.101" offset="10487724">Now, is anyone else making this equipment?</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.175" offset="10572048">They could deliver it on order and they couldn't get into the market because of the position and the activities and the practices of Ransburg with respect to some other items of equipment that they were no other in the market of these voltage packs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.096" offset="10647803">I refer the Court to volume 3, page 283, a letter of Ransburg itself to its own people, its own distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.666" offset="10690017">We have noticed they say in August 18, 1950, we have noticed that voltage supplies had been advertised which are so supposedly suitable for electrostatic painting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.176" offset="10732126">Then they warned them about using them, “Don't use them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.961" offset="10775176">On package licensing, if the Court please, there is a finding against this 71 and we contend that finding is clearly erroneous and this is the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.750" offset="10818330">We say it's erroneous because this Court has to construe the agreement, the agreements which they enter into and a proper construction of that agreement is that respondent licensed under all of its patents, now, this phrase, "pertaining to and covering methods and apparatus used in airless electrostatic spray coating."</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.328" offset="10920730">Now, that is regardless of whether those patents apply to the particular system being leased or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.221" offset="11120306">I'm referring that to that letter to show, if the Court please, that there was a potentially competitive voltage pack on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.498" offset="11169416">I referred earlier to show that -- I refer, Mr. Justice Black, to show that the sole alternative available for the airless system was only the agreement which I discussed yesterday with that restrictive language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.738" offset="11250291">And for that point Your Honor, I referred to page 315 of volume 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.659" offset="11282056">We can see, we -- the record shows that they put out some bulletins to their salesmen which said -- and this is what they relied and they put out those bulletins to salesmen saying, "Competitors if they should insist, may use their own equipment."</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.832" offset="11358751">Now, when they formed and printed and start this agreement without a provision for equipment in 1953, then that agreement was the only, the sole alternative, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.988" offset="11419355">And I refer to record page 315 for that where they say that forms numbers so and so are our current forms in the event any licensees desire a license only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.929" offset="11479124">Then when you see what the enclosure was, form 437, you find that it is that agreement which is -- contains as I contend this restrictive language which drives the perspective licensee right back to Ransburg to get his equipment.</text>
