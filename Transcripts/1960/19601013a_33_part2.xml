            <text syncTime="20.495" offset="185344">And the question was raised as to whether any of this evidence was used by the Government in asserting in its provision here that it has established its claim of possession and existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.181" offset="252113">I call the court's attention to the argument of the Government on page 16 of its brief under which it argued that it had established a prima facie case where it says that when the committee subpoenaed petitioner to produce certain designated records of the Civil Rights Congress, it "had the information that Mr. Mcphaul was the executive director or Executive Secretary of the Civil Rights Congress."</text>
            <text syncTime="69.501" offset="381367">And it cites from the record, pages17 and 21, now those two pages of the record which it cites support of this legal proposition are parts of the separate record dealing only with pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.756" offset="442389">I -- I point that out to indicate that apparently the Government does rely on the separate record for proof of a -- in support of its argument that it had established a prima facie case.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.939" offset="651160">There's no indication on the subpoena that McPhaul has any relationship with the organization through records he is directed to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.757" offset="686373">And I -- in my brief, I point to many other cases that have come up in this Court before where the subpoenas have been directed either to the individual in his descriptive capacity as an officer or to the organizations served upon him in his official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.496" offset="765367">This is apparently the usual way in which such subpoenas are issued if they're -- it's intended to bring in that person as -- in a representative capacity for the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.411" offset="804968">This case, that was not done and the Government in absence of this kind of procedure relies again upon this statement apparently on the separate record of pertinency that where Senator Potter testifies that they had evidence that he had and that is McPhaul as the Executive Secretary of the Civil Rights Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.257" offset="904443">Now, he was asked by the way by his own -- by the District Attorney to whether there is anything that he could show or any basis upon which he could support his statement that Arthur McPhaul had any relationship or was a member of the Civil Rights Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.957" offset="979153">And that question directed by the Government to Senator Potter appears on page 18 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.337" offset="1016769">I will ask you whether or not either the so-called the Executive or Closed Sessions or the public hearings, Mr. McPhaul was ever identified as a member of the Civil Rights Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.949" offset="1055117">That question was never answered and no proof was presented to show that McPhaul, who -- the defendant in this case was ever identified in any capacity a member or otherwise of the Civil Rights Congress other than this conclusory statement by Potter -- on a separate record that they had evidence that he was an Executive Secretary so that --</text>

            <text syncTime="267.867" offset="1174862">The record is not clear even on the separate record because there Senator Potter says that in 1947, or thereabout, they had several letterheads to indicate that McPhaul was Executive Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.508" offset="1237452">That of course, even if they had such evidence would have been five years before he was subpoenaed.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.781" offset="1262529">So, in so far as the Government can rely upon this separate record dealing with pertinency, which they -- it was -- it was had outside the presence of a jury and I don't see how they can rely upon that to establish their claim that they proved the elements of the crime before the jury, but even if they were permitted to do it on the reasoning which they present here, it seemed to me that that is hardly a proof of the kind that would be required in any circumstances to show that the defendant here was in a representative capacity of the organization or that there were such records.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.942" offset="1439117">On the two other questions search and seizure and pertinency, I'm only going to make one comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.345" offset="1464717">I think I'll read that as it covers the subject and that is that on reflection, it seems to me that really both of these matters can be covered under the Fourth Amendment search and seizure rather than separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.681" offset="1506095">Both the Government and ourselves deal with them separately but further study of the case has seemed to indicate that under the Fourth Amendment, all issues relating to pertinency can be as readily raised with respect to the reasonableness of the subpoenaing as by trying to bring it under one of the other amendments so that pertinency and the scope read from the subpoenaing I think can more properly and clearly be considered as a argument dealing with the same problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="449.983" offset="1903261">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.039" offset="1915486">I would like at the outset summarize what the Government's position in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.016" offset="1939414">The petitioner was convicted of willfully refusing to produce documents before the House of Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.925" offset="1971075">It's admitted he didn't produce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.201" offset="1980165">So the whole question in each case is whether this failure to produce is refusal to produce was a willful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.466" offset="2013288">We think that the Government establishes a showing of willfulness when it proves first that the subcommittee had a reasonable basis upon which to subpoena these records from this individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.683" offset="2070131">And second that when this individual appeared in response to the subpoena, he offered no justification or explanation or excuse for his non-production of the documents, but merely said, "I will not."</text>
            <text syncTime="505.757" offset="2126451">And therefore, we think in these circumstances in the absence of any explanation, it was a reasonable inference by the jury that this was a willful refusal to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.777" offset="2166471">That is, it was a deliberate and intentional clouting of the Commission's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.498" offset="2189354">And we think that in these circumstances, where there is no questions raised, and I want to emphasize that at no time either before the Subcommittee, before the District Court, before the Court of Appeals or before this Court has petitioner ever suggested that he had any excuse for non-production.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.044" offset="2263542">He's never claimed that he doesn't have the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.265" offset="2272423">He couldn't have produced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.579" offset="2277648">He was not connected with the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.450" offset="2285171">The whole argument is that it was incumbent on the Government as part of its affirmative case to prove that he had capacity to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.507" offset="2317354">And our basic position is that I'm showing that we may, it was incumbent upon the petitioner to come forward with some explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.341" offset="2352776">And I will develop that in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.250" offset="2364374">Now, I would first like to turn to the question of the -- whether the subcommittee had a reasonable basis for issuing this subpoena to this petitioner to call upon him to produce this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.687" offset="2414111">Now, the evidence on this which Mr. Goodman keep referring to as a separate record was in fact taken before the judge out of the presence of the jury because the judge held in accordance with the decision of this Court that pertinency is a matter for the court not for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.726" offset="2486314">And similarly we think the question of the pertinency of the reasonableness of the Commission's committee seeking to obtain the records from this man is comparable perhaps in many ways different but fundamentally comparable to the showing of probable cause to the issuance of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.528" offset="2553501">We know it is a question of law whether the Committee had any basis in seeking the records from this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.198" offset="2580146">Now what has the record shown us?</text>
            <text syncTime="620.807" offset="2586624">The record on this is based on the testimony of then Senator Potter who was then member of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.222" offset="2612224">To begin with, at pages 17 and 22 of the record, Senator Potter testified that the Civil Rights Congress had been declared a subversive organization both by the Attorney General and by the Committee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.199" offset="2672201">Now we're contending Mr. Justice Black in answer to a question that this evidence is sufficient to prove that the Civil Rights Congress was or was not some subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.282" offset="2712534">All that we say is the Committee on the basis of this information was justified in saying it wanted to have a look at these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.806" offset="2742627">That's all it was asking the man to do and have a look at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.127" offset="2759868">Now the Committee also, the testimony by Senator Potter particularly at page 22 -- sorry, page 21 and also at page 17, Senator Potter stated, "The committee had information that Mr. McPhaul was Executive Director or Executive Secretary for Civil Rights Congress."</text>
            <text syncTime="689.561" offset="2861641">Now one basis for this information was the letterhead in the Committee files showing that in 1947, this man was the Executive Secretary of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.830" offset="2914722">There is nothing in this statement that limits this statement, this testimony indicating that was the only thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.635" offset="2941889">And significantly I think when Mr. Goodman read to the Court this question that Senator Potter where there was any evidence taken at the executive hearing whether Mr. McPhaul was ever identified as the member of the Civil Rights Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.933" offset="3007091">Mr. Goodman neglected to read the very next sentence on page 18 which is Mr. Goodman's statement, "I will object to that on the ground of that it constitutes hearsay."</text>
            <text syncTime="734.718" offset="3042200">Now, if the petitioner question the basis of the Committee for subpoenaing Mr. McPhaul, I petition the question that the Committee had any basis for taking this man was in fact connected with the organization, he could have cross-examined Senator Potter at this hearing before the judge, cross-examine on one peripheral issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.933" offset="3135091">At no point did he-cross examine Senator Potter on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.468" offset="3153272">Now as I shall indicate briefly later in my argument.</text>
