            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- is that the member sanctions are invalid not because they apply whether or not the member has knowledge that the organization is of the character that the Subversive Control Board says that it is and even though the member disagrees with the Court's estimate of its character.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.600" offset="205824">But there is I think another due process restriction here other than that of this scientor as to the organization purposes and that restriction, I think was spelled out not in Warrington but in Adler against the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.532" offset="269458">And the principle there is that a person cannot, because of membership in a bad organization, be excluded from privileges open to other people unless he personally has an opportunity to establish that despite his membership, he is a fit person to enjoy the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.551" offset="357543">In other words, as I read Adler, it says that a presumption of unfitness to enjoy a privilege cannot be made conclusive because of organizational membership, the most it can be is a prima facie presumption which the member has to -- have a chance to rebut.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.590" offset="433716">The Act doesn't give a member a chance to rebut at any such presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.765" offset="454405">He doesn't get a hearing as to his personal fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.273" offset="468511">He doesn't get a chance to show that even if he is a Communist, still that's not a good reason in his case, to deprive him of his job in General Motors or some other defense facility or to deprive him of his union office or to bar him from traveling abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.450" offset="545207">He gets no chance to show that despite his membership in the Party, he has no individual propensity of the wrong-doing and that he is an innocent and trustworthy and loyal person and for those two reasons alone, I think that the member sanctions are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.359" offset="624828">If he resigns, if he's willing to give up his constitutional right to be a member of the Communist Party, then he gets out these sanctions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="153.133" offset="715943">I think a person does have a constitutional right to be member of the Communist Party and I think that that -- that -- that was --was assumed by the Court in the Douds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.451" offset="761187">I want to skip over now to various other constitutional questions in order to come to a question of application and construction of the Act and that involves the meaning of the term, foreign control.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.312" offset="832658">Now, under Section 3 (3) of the Act, a Communist-action organization is defined in terms of two characteristics, both of which have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.429" offset="877066">In the first of these characteristics is that the organization be substantially directed, dominated or controlled by the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.966" offset="915205">In Board's convenience it is this component that we're calling the foreign control component of the definition of a Communist-action organization and the meaning of this foreign control component comes up in at least two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.743" offset="990333">First, we say that the Board and the court below, applied an erroneous concept to foreign control and that on this ground alone, the Court's order and the judgment below should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.790" offset="1046549">And secondly, we say that under a correct definition of the foreign control component, it is clear that the evidence does not establish the existence of that component.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.686" offset="1102137">Now, the meaning that we would give and that we say the foreign control component should have requires a relationship in which the Soviet Union has and exercised some power to exact compliance with its demands from a domestic organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.884" offset="1194924">It's not satisfied merely by some voluntary conformity by the domestic organization with the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.046" offset="1239542">We say that in a controlled relationship for the purposes of the statute, there has to be some course of means, direct or indirect, whereby the superior, in this case, the Soviet Union, can compel compliance with its requirements or impose sanctions for noncompliance and if there is no means of coercion, there cannot be any control.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="311.444" stopTime="314.054">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="311.444" offset="1349151">This legal control (Inaudible)</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="314.054" stopTime="397.781">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="314.054" offset="1359600">Yes, but legal control involves some kind of coercive mechanism, but if -- if there is no means by which one or the -- the Soviet Union has any power to discipline or coerce the organization and a domestic organization nevertheless, imitates or follows or adheres to Soviet views or policies, that adherence is a product of voluntary conformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.426" offset="1477047">It's not a product of control and this gets us back very much to the initial question that Justice Black has.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.734" offset="1510275">Because if all this -- if all of that the foreign control of this statute requires, is not that the foreign government have any power to give any behest to the organization as Justice Black says, but merely that the domestic organization agrees and acquiesces in the views of the foreign power or even on its own, goes out and promotes those views, so that it is not anything like a genuine agent, then obviously a -- any constitutional source drawn from power to control foreign relations doesn't exist, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.789" offset="1674533">Now, this meaning of control that I am suggesting as some coercive mechanism --</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="399.153" stopTime="760.855">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="399.153" offset="1700028">It follows I think from the dictionary definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.301" offset="1712567">It follows from the case definitions in other fields of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.541" offset="1729494">It's the only meaning which corresponds to the description in Section 2 of the Act of the relationship between the Soviet Union and Communist-action organizations in various countries and it is the only meaning which prevents the foreign control component from being a redundant here of the Section 3 (3) definition, because if all that the foreign control component means or -- is a voluntary following of Soviet objective, then it is absolutely nothing to the second component of a Communist-action organization in Section 3 (3), which is that the organization advanced Soviet objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.421" offset="1921024">And finally, if the foreign control component is satisfied by nothing more than the organization's voluntary conformity and it conforms to the Soviet ideas because it agrees with them, then it seems me, it magnifies the constitutional objections to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.613" offset="1989778">Now, the government seems to say that the definition I have suggested can't be correct because there can't be a relationship whereby a foreign group can coerce a domestic organization, but obviously this isn't so and domestic groups can be and are controlled by foreigners or by foreign sources in a lot ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.341" offset="2088730">And for example, financial subsidization can be a lever of control because the giver can withhold or threaten to withhold funds or subsidies by noncompliance with attrition or you can have control through property ownership, through financial indebtedness or in the case of a corporation, through stock ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.751" offset="2170337">You can have levers of control through a power to punish essential supplies because under the organization's charter, the power to name some officers or directors is reserved to -- to the controller or through an interlocking directorate and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.183" offset="2240136">Now, I am perfectly sure for example that Standard Oil of New Jersey has and utilizes levers of control over various foreign enterprises even though it doesn't actually own them.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.348" offset="2292799">Now, if we're right as to the meaning of control, then it is clear that the Board and the court below applied a wrong construction of the statute and this misconstruction is in fact, expressly stated in the court's second opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.080" offset="2359672">But in addition to that, there is no evidence and there is no final by either of the Court or the Board that the Soviet Union or any Soviet organization has or utilizes any leavers whereby it may or does exercise any coercive authority over the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.783" offset="2446503">And with regard to the subject of finances and I've mentioned finances as a potential lever, the Board itself expressly found and I quote and this is the court's finding, "The record contains no evidence of substantial financial aid subsequent to 1940 and none after 1944."</text>
            <text syncTime="609.028" offset="2539499">Now, in its second opinion, the court below appreciating and acknowledging the actions of evidence of any coercive means, held that the foreign control component does not require any coercive power and expressly said that the foreign control component is satisfied if an organization voluntarily follows Soviet direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.067" offset="2647646">Now, for reasons I have already covered, this is just wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.437" offset="2669171">But even if this test is adopted, if it's enough to have a voluntary following a Soviet direction, it still was not applied by the court and it still was not met by the evidence because if the test is a voluntary compliance with Soviet directions, then the record has to show that the petitioner receives Soviet directions with which it then comply even voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.076" offset="2775646">But the fact is that there is no evidence and there is no finding by either the Board or the court below that at any time since at least 1940, 10 years before enactment of the Act, 1940 the date when petitioner disaffiliated from the Communist International, there is no evidence, there is no finding that since 1940, petitioner received any Soviet directive or anything that could be construed to be a Soviet directive for him to follow voluntarily or involuntarily and the government's brief itself, acknowledge it and this is in its footnote on page 235, Footnote 84.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.641" offset="2985984">Petitioner, that's us, correctly states, that the Board made no findings that petitioner has continued to receive directives from the Soviet Union after his disaffiliation from the Communist International and that this disaffiliation as I've said was in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.831" offset="3066650">Now, we now agree at pages 99 to 100, we list all the contacts after 1940 between petitioner and the Soviet Union or Soviet citizens which are mentioned in the Board's modified report, every single one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="762.334" offset="3152750">Pages 99 and 100 of our brief and there are just five of them and this is what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.683" offset="3182111">First, that in 1945, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, one of petitioners' leaders and officers, while on a visit to France, ran into some Russian women and she chatted with them about child care, postwar reconstruction and the rights of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.901" offset="3262986">Second, in 1949, the petitioner sends Stalin a telegram, congratulating him on his 70th birthday and saying that he was a great man and that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had -- had -- and -- and that the Soviet Union had great achievements.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.677" offset="3338115">That was his 70th birthday telegram.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.740" offset="3350340">Third, in December 1950, the Communist Party, the Soviet Union sent a telegram of greetings to petitioners' National Convention in which they set up among other things that petitioner was a -- was really standing up pretty good under all the unjust attacks from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.337" offset="3432678">Fourth, if petitioners' publications sometimes reprint articles and Soviet publication and its members sometimes read a newspaper put up by the -- now, debunked European Communist Information Bureau and five, the daily worker had a correspondent in Moscow.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.398" offset="3512926">Now these are all the contacts, if they've been be called contacts, since 1940, beginning 10 years before the -- the enactment of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.251" offset="3552423">They show no Soviet directions to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.200" offset="3564126">They show no Soviet assistance to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.124" offset="3575829">They show no dealings between the petitioner and the Soviet Union other than two congratulatory telegrams, one, in one direction and one, in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.363" offset="3608848">They show no supervision by the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.258" offset="3620446">They show no reporting by petitioners to the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.153" offset="3636015">They just have no relevance to show foreign control any more than if the Government introduced evidence as I suppose they might have been able to do that American Communist wants to see a performance to this (Inaudible) ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.457" offset="3697246">So it's abundantly clear that neither the Board nor the court below applied a meaningful definition of foreign control and furthermore that even under the loose definition of the court below of a voluntary following of directions, foreign control wasn't proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.451" offset="3777181">Now, this brings me to the next series of errors in the construction and application of the Act and that is the kind of evidence that the Board and the court below did rely on in finding that the petitioners are Communist-action organization and in finding the existence of foreign control.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.184" offset="3856071">This evidence is summarized in one paragraph in the last opinion in the court below and the paragraph is quoted on pages 12 and 13 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.055" offset="3903613">And this paragraph and the Board's report and the summary to the Board's report that is very much a longer line from the paragraph, show that the determination of the petitioner is up -- is under Soviet control, rests on three bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.084" offset="3975711">The first basis is that prior to 1940, petitioner was a member of the Communist International.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.637" offset="4009880">Now, during this period, the petitioner bound himself to comply with directions of the International, the organization with -- which is its affiliate and the record contains rims and rims of evidence, put in at length by the Attorney General, concerning this pre-1940 period, in evidence that the petitioner received direction from the Communist International that it received financial assistance from the International, that it was supervised by and reported to the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.102" offset="4143731">Now, in 1940, the petitioner disaffiliated from the Communist International and thereafter, it had absolutely no contact with it of any kind. This disaffiliation was on a friendly basis.</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="1026.189" stopTime="1770.776">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="1026.189" offset="4208097">Oh yes, well, you -- you can read this record from beginning to end and you will find no dealings, no pointing of dealings between petitioner and the Communist International after 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.453" offset="4261177">And in 1943, the Communist International went out of existence, so there certainly couldn't have been any dealings after 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.039" offset="4299525">Now, this disaffiliation wasn't on any hostile basis, but that the petitioner publicly announced that it was disaffiliating from the Communist International and that it thought it was in outrage that they'll have to do so, but -- but it was disaffiliating from the Communist International in order to avoid registering under the newly enacted (Inaudible) Act, then they made a public statement to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.708" offset="4406209">But regardless of its motivation, the fact is that the petitioner did disaffiliate and that thereafter, had no contacts or dealings with the International and I've listed all the contacts since 1940 where I -- I spoke them out with the Soviet Union and -- and they amount to nothing and as I said, the International itself dissolved in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.517" offset="4509445">But the Board just raveled in this evidence of the pre-1940 period, evidence of a relationship which had terminated and the Board and the court placed an overwhelming reliance on this pre-1940 evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.821" offset="4574647">The Act however defines a Communist-action organization in terms of the present and the issue therefore, was the current character of the petitioner and character behind the administrative proceedings or at least after the enactment of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.632" offset="4641938">And under the rule of this Court's decision in the Cement Institute case, evidence of prior transactions and that is transactions prior to the critical period and in this case, since the petition -- since the case was started so soon after the Act was enacted, we can talk in terms of pre-act transactions, evidence of pre-act transactions was relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.056" offset="4747577">Only where you had a continuing situation, where the pre-act or prior transactions tended reasonably to show or illuminate the purpose or character of the current transactions, in this case the post-act transactions, but here there weren't any current transactions that they illuminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.621" offset="4829811">And what the Board and the court did, was to treat as proof of a present relationship, a relationship and practices which had been discontinued 10 years before enactment of the Act and this a clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.085" offset="4895744">In order for a relist at pages 106 and 100 -- through 108, all of the post-act matters sighted by the Board's report and since had 2 or 3 pages, I'm not going to read them but I just say that all you have to do is to examine them but see that none of these matters of any tendency to show the petitioner is controlled by the Soviet Union or operates to advance the objective prescribed in Section 2 of the act, in fact, they are certainly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.916" offset="5023013">Even the Government concedes in its brief and I quote now from pages 268 to 269 that, "The Government's evidence as the petitioner's post-1950 activities might perhaps not independently proved it to be a Communist-action organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.715" offset="5122278">Now the Government goes to say that this evidence does show that petitioners' character hasn't substantially changed, since to the days of the Communist International.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.970" offset="5179225">Now of course that the post-act evidence is that well maybe it -- it doesn't show you're under foreign control, but it shows you haven't changed your (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.680" offset="5218095">Now of course, the question isn't whether petitioners' character changed or what petitioners' character is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.832" offset="5246725">The question is what is the relationship shown by the record between petitioner and Soviet Union?</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.523" offset="5273475">And it is perfectly clear that there was a change in that relationship in 1940 as a result of an end to petitioner's disaffiliation from the Communist International or by that disaffiliation petitioner removes itself from the only possible apparatus of control, petitioner removed itself from any further contacts, dealings or communication with the Soviet Union and after1940, petitioner no longer received any foreign directive or had any meaningful contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.498" offset="5409416">The -- this brings me to the other two bases for the finding against petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.175" offset="5428120">The first one is discontinued relationship, discontinued 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.768" offset="5450480">The other two bases are those which lead the Government to say the petitioner hasn't changed its character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.997" offset="5479320">What is the second basis that is shown by the Court of -- of the summary of the court below?</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.023" offset="5507427">The second basis is that if the petitioner disaffiliated from the Communist International, it continued to be Communist, it continued to adhere to and it still adheres to the principles of Communism and not only the principles of Communism, but the principle of Communism as they appear in the theoretical writing of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and others and apparently, these writings had such as terrific versatility because they proved a case under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.586" offset="5629680">They proved foreign control under the -- under the McCarran Act and it is true that after 1940, the petitioner remained a Communist organization, it kept the name Communism and it adhered to the principles of Communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.302" offset="5696554">And it is those writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin that the Board is referring to when it says in its modified report and I quote, this is at page 2409 of the record, footnote 2, "The really vital part of the Attorney General's case, is documentary evidence which to considerable extent, means relatively little to our illumination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.470" offset="5809298">So the first basis was the pre-1940 evidence, the second basis is that they plead in Communism and the third basis was the so-called non-deviation evidence that Mr. Abt referred to before lunch, and which is that petitioners consistently agreed with Soviet views, particularly in the field of foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.884" offset="5890905">So as far as the period after 1940 is concerned, if we leave aside this irrelevant Communist International stuff, we're left solely with ideological matters as a foundation for the Board's order, namely and for the affirmance below, namely that petitioner subscribed to Communist principles or to Marxism and Leninism agrees with the Soviet Union, particularly in the field of foreign policy and thinks that the Soviet Union is the great power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.333" offset="6012740">And that what this case is about, that's the clear and present danger, that's the foreign relation nexus that is supposed to justify outlawing the petitioner and making life in powerful for its members and for anybody that the Government say the members under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.327" offset="6084629">And the court below recognized this fact in its last opinion, because it said in explanation of this conclusion and I quote and this is the quote, “this is right after its summary to the other, they conclude, “One who attaches himself by intellectual affiliation to a cause, assumes the name of the cause, puts on the (Inaudible) of the cause and adheres to the course of cause, is not mistreated if it be inferred prima facie, he is part of the cause."</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.180" offset="6236139">And that's saying that the evidence justified the court in finding that the petitioner has an intellectual affiliation with the cause of Communism in that instant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.000" offset="6279398">Now we don't dispute that intellectual affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.793" offset="6290578">We don't dispute that the petitioner has assumed the name of the cause of Communism that it adheres the Communism that it is a Communist organization from each point of view, but we do say that this intellectual affiliation of the Communism and that's all there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.150" offset="6355989">It is not a basis under the terms of the Act of finding that petitioner is dominated and controlled by the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.272" offset="6384410">And if it were, if the Act permitted a finding foreign control and the subsequent outlawry to be based on that kind of intellectual affiliation, we say it would be a gross violation of the First Amendment to outlaw the petitioners, subject its members to the sanctions that make them untouchables because of their intellectual affiliation to Communism or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.411" offset="6485034">I'll now, pass over several other points in order to come to another point in the Court's application of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.135" offset="6543862">And this is our point that the court below erred in refusing to remand the case, because of the Board's erroneous reliance on a finding concerning secret practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.963" offset="6591195">And the situation here is that Section 13 here in the Act, sets up eight criteria which the Board is directed to apply in determining whether an accused organization meets the Section 3 (3) definition of the Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.224">The seventh of these criterions, Section 13 (e) (7), is the extent to which the accused organization engages in secret practices for the purpose of concealing foreign control or for the purpose of promoting the organization's objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.748">Engaging in secret practices for other purposes, doesn't meet these criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.452">Now, in its original report, the Board found that petitioner engages in secret practices for both of the purposes stated in Section 13 (e) (7) and this was one of the findings on which it based its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.913">One of the eight findings that made eight findings under -- under Section 13 (e) all of them adverse the petitioner and then it issued its order and this was one of the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.499">Now, when this got to the Court of Appeals on its first review and its first opinion, the Court Appeals held that the purpose finding in the Board was not supported by the evidence and it said we strike the finding and the purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.828">We don't think that the evidence disclosed as a clearly revealed purpose either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.553">Now, the effect of this was to make the secret practices, purpose solicited from a legal point of view, but it made the secret practices standard of Section 13 (e) (7) inapplicable to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.439">The court didn't say we were right when we -- we had introduced evidence as the purpose in the secret practices, was in order to protect the members of the Communist Party from unjust and unconstitutional persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.709">The court said, well, I will say, you're right but the Board certainly didn't do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.061">So that meant that 13 (e) (7), one of the eight key findings of the Board was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.970">But although the Court of Appeals thus reversed the Board on the one of its eight key findings, nevertheless, it affirmed the Board's order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.549">They denied the petition for rehearing without any observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.491">And when we took the first affirmance, when we came here on our first petition for certiorari, one of the questions we raised was, wasn't it wrong for the Court of Appeals to affirm rather than to remand?</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.249">As a matter of fact on the first review, they had not only stricken the finding on secret practices but they had also modified another one of the eight findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.340">Well, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.343">As you know the case went back to the Board and you never got with its question about the effect the Board's erroneous finding on secret practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.523">But when the case went back and in the subsequent remand proceedings, the Board deleted from the record huge quantities of evidence, including much evidence which it had considered unfavorable to petitioner on the subject of secret practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.552">No new evidence on the subject was added at all, so the record on secret practice was now better for us than it has before, because it has been the lead any of our evidence, if the lead allowed the Government (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.462">Nevertheless, the Board retained in the modified report, one of the stricken purpose findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.822">It yielded to the Court of Appeals to the extent of abandoning one of its original true purpose finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.819">It now disclaimed making any finding that the secret practices were engaged in for the purpose of concealing foreign control, but contrary to the holding of the Court of Appeals, it repeated and restated its finding without even giving the Court of Appeals the deference of dimension, it repeated and reinstated its findings that petitioner engages in secret practices for the purpose of promoting its supposedly sinister objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.723">So the result was that the criterion of Section 13 (e) (7) was again made applicable for the petitioners' disadvantage and it was just as applicable whether they had one purpose or both purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.142">When the case went back to the Court of Appeals, we called this -- the attention of the court and court said, the Board was wrong before and the Board is wrong again and the court repeated its holding that the Board's finding was not supported by the evidence nevertheless, it again affirmed the Board's order in (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.411">In our original opinion on this matter, we struck as not supported by preponderance to the evidence, a finding respecting the purposes of the secret practices of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.210">The Board has let the finding remain and its modified report on second remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.679">The Party says the court must therefore again remand to the Board, for the administrative redetermination in the light of the striking to this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.335">We do not see why we should so. We did not find it necessary to reverse the order of the Board or to remand when we first struck the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.356">No new evidence on the point has been added since then and so we adhere to our first conclusion, but the necessity for remand is now no greater than it was and we think the Board is entitled to adhere to its view on the point until our view of it has been tested in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.938">Now, we think that what the Court of Appeals did, usurp the function of the Board and violated the principles stated by this Court in the Chenery case that the grounds, “the grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which the record discloses that agency's action was based, and that administrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted or those upon which its action can be sustained."</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.468">And the situation here is the same as in the Virginia Electric and Power case, where the Court remanded a Labor Board order for administrative redetermination because the Board's ultimate conclusion rested in part on the finding which had insufficient evidentiary support and the Court did so even though it expressly recognized that the Labor Board might have reached, astoundedly had reached the same ultimate conclusion without the erroneous finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.819">Now, the Government argues in brief that a remand is not required because it says the Board did not attach much importance to its secrecy finding and reaching its ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.748">And the argument is wrong legally in the light of Chenery and Virginia Electric and Power, but it's also a wrong action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.540">In the first place, the Board is a tribunal, never said that its finding on secret practices was not essential and never said that its finding on secret practice wasn't important for the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.375">That's just what the Government is saying now belatedly as a litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.820">And it's significant that the Board as a tribunal, refused to make that finding any -- refused to make any such disclaimer even though it knew when it repeated it, the offending finding that it was contradicting the Court of Appeals and that we were going to make exactly the same argument that I am making at this moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.850">They could've taken most of the curse of the matter off if they had just said, well, we still adhere to this view, we still make this finding, but it doesn't make any difference anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.342">They didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.383">In the second place, this isn't just an ordinary subsidiary finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.666">This is a finding under one of eight statutory criteria established by section 13 (e), you -- so if you disparage the finding, you disparage the statutory criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.553">In this situation, an advocation is -- is worst than that, because of the eight findings under this criteria, the Government now defends the order on the bases of only 5 of the 8, one of which is the finding on secrecy and which the secrecy finding that makes the difference between a plurality of Section 13 (e) finding against the petitioner or in even division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.289">And finally, it's just impossible for me to see why the Board devoted 19 closely printed pages in the modified report that the subject had secret practices, they considered the entire subject to the unimportant and unessential.</text>

            <text syncTime="2336.328">At the original Board hearing in 1952, Budenz testified among other things, the two supposed incidents which had come to be known in this litigation as the (Inaudible) in the Wiener conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.883">I -- I will save time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.683">I'm not going into what the testimony was, but there were two important subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.670">On cross-examination Budenz said, he has reported these incidents to the FBI orally and didn't know whether or to what extent the FBI had refused them their right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.458">So we move for the production of these statements or reports made by defense of the FBI about the historic letter in the Wiener conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.363">The Attorney General or his representatives objected to the motions and the Board denied that motion. When the case went back to the Board after the remand, we again moved for the production of Budenz's reports to the FBI on the (Inaudible) matters and this time added the alternative that at least the Board inspect them in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.221">Again the Attorney General objected, again the Board sustained the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.299">So we complained about these rulings to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.750">The Government in its brief from the Court of Appeals, defended the rulings on the grounds that there weren't any written reports by Budenz on these two matters, but at most, only some summaries prepared by the FBI and not seen by the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.475">On the basis of this representation, the Court of Appeals said, we weren't entitled to the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.824">We filed the petition for rehearing but this time for the first time it occurred to the Government that instead of making the representations that weren't any reports, perhaps, Government counsel should check with the FBI first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.163">So, they checked with the FBI which probably informed them that the FBI had recorded verbatim days and days of interview with defense including a material which would be relevant for the subjects of Wiener and (Inaudible) matter, so then the Government counsel filed a memorandum which they informed the Court of Appeals that they had finally checked with the FBI, they had learned that the FBI had the verbatim recording and then told the court that -- that they thought that -- that under the Jencks rule, we were entitled to get those portions of the recording which related to the Wiener (Inaudible), so the court changed this ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.657">The case was going back for other purposes anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.393">So when the case got back to the Board level we cut excerpts from Budenz's talks with the FBI which are relevant to the (Inaudible) and Wiener testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.232">It became apparent to us. I think it becomes apparent to anybody that looks at them objectively, not only that they contradicted this testimony on this matter, but that they indicated a pattern typical of this witness that he had deliberately concocted testimony that fit the particular needs of the occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.763">So we said, call Budenz back, we call him because now, we wanted to be able to cross-examine him with the aid of the -- these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.762">Then hearing the examiner, who is the member of the Board, ruled that we were entitled Budenz recalled for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.669">Then it turns out that Budenz had a lasting illness, he was too sick to be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.170">So we never did get the opportunity to cross-examine with the aid of the statements, despite the fact that by now it was freely and finally conceded that we had been entitled for that opportunity when we had first asked them that there has been error to deny the opportunity in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2583.253">Our motion was denied by the Board but the Board did strike those parts of Budenz's testimony which related to the (Inaudible) and Wiener matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.829">It kept the rest of Budenz's testimony in and it made findings based on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.025">The Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling, Judge Bazalon dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.480">And the question is therefore, what are the consequences of a deprivation -- of this deprivation of cross-examination caused by the witness' death or lasting illness?</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.326">Such authority there, as there is on the subject, is summarized by weight more to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.863">First, if the witness or the party Wigmore has any sort of responsibility for the deprivation, then all of the witnesses' direct testimony must be stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.777">The illustration given by Wigmore is a case, where a party obtained the postponement to direct examination and the witness died or became sick during the recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.440">Second, even if the Party offering the witness has no responsibility for the deprivation, nevertheless, all of the witnesses' testimony must be stricken if the deprived party suffers a material loss from the deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.870">If this rule is applied we say, it is clear that all of Budenz's testimony should have been stricken for each of the two reasons given by Wigmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.280">To get to the second thing first, by being deprived the opportunity to cross-examine this witness with the aid of these two statements which showed contradictions and consistencies and perjury on these two vital matters, we were denied the opportunity to discredit him on other matters and to show that he belonged in the same category as the Government's three other perjurers who appeared in this case Crouch, Johnson and Matusow, because we were deprived from that opportunity to discredit him generally and because the Board nevertheless, went ahead and made important findings based on his testimony, we suffered a material loss from being deprived of -- of this opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.501">Secondly and this is the first reason given by Wigmore, the responsibility for the deprivation does rest on the Attorney General and the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.505">It was the Attorney General who made ill founded objections to our production demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.394">It was the Board which made erroneous ruling to sustaining these objections and that caused the deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.394">Moreover, the Attorney General had an additional responsibility because he withheld the fact that the FBI had the yet -- had the Budenz statements in its possession until it was too late to recall it then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.964">For this reasons, all of Budenz's testimony should've been stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.931">I don't know if we have any time left but we too, will reserve it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4243.658">That Section of the statute in Section 5 of the 1954 Act, deals with the problem of a prosecution, a criminal prosecution against an individual for membership from the Party and then it proceeds to say, these different elements shall be considered as to whether he is a member in accordance with instructions to the jury in a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.395">Now that's entirely different from the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.358">It doesn't in anyway, say that in this statute or in that one as it amends this, that that shall be used in regard to who are members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.706">They are to file and say who their members are and then if anyone is prosecuted under the (Inaudible) those are considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.427">It doesn't say that anybody who happens to be affiliated is a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.343">There aren't any such words in the statute, but it says if he's paid money, if he's affiliated, if he's attended meetings, those are things that should be considered and Congress was reasonable in taking those various things as considerations for the jury to examine and the jury was -- and jurors say and if the court didn't sort the case by directing verdict that many of those things that the evidence was not substantial and showing the real connection, were not enough to have any jury convict a man of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.361">So that it isn't kind -- that is no definition either by contemplation or anyway in your -- can construe this statute of what membership is in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.865">They ought to try to determine what the membership is and presumably, Congress thought they ought to know if they are people in leadership of this part and then it gets to the question of the individual and he if the Party doesn't register him, he is to come forth, but there all kinds of protections for the individual, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.843">He has an opportunity at anytime to withdraw and the list isn't made public, for a considerable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.653">And it doesn't say whether he was a member for 12 months as counsel remarked here, prior to the time of filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.691">The statute says, if he was a member at the time of the filing and what he wants to get off the list, Congress provided that he can come forward and he can tell the Attorney General, I'm not a member of the Communist Party and therefore, I ask my name be removed and there can't be any publication of his name until a later date after all that question was settled and a provision for an appeal to the Board and he doesn't have to say, I was not a -- a member at the time that they were ordered to file or at the time they order became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.792">All he has to say, he has a period of 30 days in which to do anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.407">After notice, is I deny that I am a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.411">That's all he has to do and come forth and make presentation to Attorney General throughout that period, his name is not to be published in anyway and no lists has been published that included his name until after that whole question is tried out and this criteria are not the -- the test at all for whether he's -- he's a member of the Communist Party at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.352">So the Congress did try to protect the person who wanted to get out and who was mistakenly put in or listed and all of those things that might catch someone who in, did not intend to be connected with Communist-action or Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.166">Now there is this element enough that has been discussed to here, about whether or not, he gets any independent trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.419">It's a position with the Government that this is a -- an administrative proceeding in which the due process is provided for by the Congress for this Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.370">There is complete judicial review for the action of the Board and the standard is higher than this Court has approved for administrative proceedings many times in that it require a clear preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.748">And the Court of Appeals in examining the matter, said that, that was a much more stringent test and I'm sure that Your Honors will recognize this it's much more a strength of test and it conscientiously tried to apply that test to the record in this case and to such an extent that it took some 76 pages of an opinion to examine all of this evidence and not only say that their findings were justified by the evidence, but going step-by-step to every finding, as been claimed here that some of these findings under 13 (e), some eight of them, they were not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.100">That is there were some that they did not find and therefore, since they didn't find any under those three or four sections of or paragraphs of 13 (e) that they were not justified in finding this a Communist-action organization under the 3 (e) (3), but the statute is not developed or built in and properly construed that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.567">The test of whether it's a Communist-action organization is clearly set forth in Section 3 -- 3 in parenthesis, and which is defined what a Communist-action organization is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.929">And then that Congress set up in 13 (e), eight different items of evidence to consider and it said, you shall determine in arriving at whether or not a -- an organization satisfies the requirements of Section 3 (3).</text>

One of them, important to register, just plain, come in and register and I think that would satisfy that, now I don't think it satisfies the part about a registration statement giving detail of their officers, members and their finances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.606">I think there are two parts to it and Congress wanted them to come forth and register in any form and then it also wanted this detailed information for good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.526">They wanted to know who the officers were and who the members were and what kind of financing this type of organization has.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.666">But I think that's clear that there are two parts and I don't think the forms contemplate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.601">I think the forms make it clear that the regulation of the Attorney General was to provide for this one form, ISA-1 (Inaudible) called and the form said in so many words that the officers have signed it, but I don't think the statute contemplated that is the only way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.647">I think statute contemplated registration and the registration statement and it says so and so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.167">And the Court can satisfy itself as whether or not, it does, well that is a proper interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.866">But that's the way I think it's clear from the language of it and I think with the Congress (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.272">First, they were in (Inaudible) this Act in several claims, they wanted to be -- they considered the question of trying to outlaw the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.096">And they passed on to the question of disclosure. They decided they preferred the idea of trying to get out in the open, who was at the back of the Party and all the information they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.877">The vice that Congress saw in this thing was not what counsel have been talking about here, as to whether or not they could add or talk about Marxism and Leninism as such, as an ideology.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.831">That wasn't what Congress is trying to reach at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.775">It was trying to reach a foreign control by the Soviet Union Party that was operating in the United States to try to carryout the objectives of that foreign or that world Communist movement and it wanted to get that kind of a Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.366">And if this particular Party, the petitioner here was not that kind of a Party, there wouldn't be any problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.263">It wasn't interesting, but if it was that kind with that kind of foreign domination control and trying to further the objectives of that kind of world Communist movement within the United States, it want to reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.069">And it want to reach it first, to get it out in the open, so everybody knew what it was, who its officers were, who its members were and what its finances were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.962">That's the first part and it was also interested in having the people of this country, have the adjudication and they weren't interested in adjudication just by some Board or administrative agency, they provided for an appeal with the preponderance of -- of the evidence to be the determination -- determining factor and appeal to the Court of Appeals to review that evidence and then for a right to come to this Court on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5906.926">So they wanted to be sure that there was a clear opportunity for a judicial process in addition to the administrative process to make this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.121">Once that had happened, upon the fair hearing, this Court was to determine finally whether there was a barrier, they wanted the people of the United States to know just exactly what kind of an organization this was, not because anybody would claim it before this Court or in some other court or claim it in the press or as individuals, but because they'd had a hearing and it was adjudicated and they placed great importance on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.165">Then they wanted to get the information before the public and this Court in regard to that, has recognized in quite a number of statutes that there doesn't have to be any clear and present danger for disclosure statutes and has recognized the power of Congress to provide for disclosure, for there's a proper reason.</text>
