            <text syncTime="6.059" offset="127561">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.503" offset="133413">I had practically completed my reference to the statement of facts before lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.123" offset="167894">There is one other point that I would like to mention and that is that the United States has concluded that this was an oral rental agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.430" offset="209063">I do not feel that this is supported by the evidence and by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.404" offset="232991">I refer the Court to page 75 of the record there at the -- down in the second answer, the lengthy answer there, "And I fixed him up, agreed to rent it to him and fixed him up a standard 30-day rental contract for the rent and erred."</text>
            <text syncTime="57.437" offset="333093">I don't believe the evidence supports that it's an oral, although I do not know that that is too significant in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="65.324" offset="364648">Well, does it make any difference?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Sewell Elliott</label>
            <text syncTime="66.883" offset="370918">I don't think it does, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.208" offset="392234">Now, since the decision of the Fifth Circuit in this case, this Court in the Elkins case, overruled the so-called "silver platter doctrine" by holding that evidence obtained by state officers which would have violated the constitutional rights of an individual, if it had been obtained by the federal officers, is not admissible in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.892" offset="486902">So I think this would dispose of the -- any question that might come by the fact that a state agent first entered this house and that the federal agents were immediately called into the case, the silver platter doctrine question is disposed of.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="112.023" stopTime="115.602">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="112.023" offset="551476">The Court of Appeals didn't rely on this silver platter doctrine at all, did it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="115.602" stopTime="225.450">
            <label>Mr. J. Sewell Elliott</label>
            <text syncTime="115.602" offset="565791">No, the Court of Appeals stated in their opinion that they were not relying upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.863" offset="586794">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.970" offset="595257">Although the United States never questioned specifically the standing of petitioner as a lessee of these premises, the trial court did hunt as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.722" offset="638307">However, we feel that this question has been put at rest by the recent decision of this Court in Jones from District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.133" offset="679894">There are two recent cases, Jones cases that I will refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.477" offset="697240">One originated in Georgia and one in the District of Columbia and I will refer to them as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.385" offset="720959">I make reference now to the Jones case from the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.538" offset="745514">In other words, in the Jones case from the District of Columbia, if anyone is legally upon the premises, then he has a standing to assert his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.854" offset="798804">In view of these two recent decisions of this Court, this leaves only one question open to the Court at this time and that is, was this search and seizure reasonable under these circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="187.482" offset="853347">Now, I would like to mention some general principles before proceeding further.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.794" offset="878529">First, a search and seizure cannot be separated as intimated by the United States in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.140" offset="907891">They cannot be considered as two separate things.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.147" offset="920012">They must be considered together, the search and the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.109" offset="935790">You cannot say that one part is the search and the other part is the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.354" offset="960763">That has been very clearly set forth in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.819" offset="982601">This Court has also held that a search warrant is necessary in all instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.323" offset="1364616">However, the language there and also in the -- the Jeffers case.</text>

          <turn speaker="j_sewell_elliott" startTime="357.100" stopTime="1211.653">
            <label>Mr. J. Sewell Elliott</label>
            <text syncTime="357.100" offset="1531800">As a general principle, it might be said that a search warrant is necessary, except when you have a search incident to a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.610" offset="1573804">Now, that maybe with or without an arrest warrant or -- or either in exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.094" offset="1607764">And if the burden is upon the Government to show the need for searching premises without a warrant and we feel that they have not shown any need, any compelling circumstance that would require them to search these premises before obtaining a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.236" offset="1700342">I think another general principle that is important to us today is that evidence found after the entry cannot be used to justify the entry nor can theories that have been conceived in the attorney's office or in the law enforcement offices, some months or years after the entry was made, be of any assistance in any way to justify a search without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.709" offset="1818206">It would depend upon the particular facts and circumstances available at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.565" offset="1845582">In view of the contention of the Government which I anticipate, I think that that perhaps would be of importance to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.770" offset="1886438">Also, the Fourth Amendment applies to those justly accused as well as to the innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.275" offset="1916426">It is a constitutional guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.911" offset="1935026">Now, getting back to this search which was a search without a warrant, either an arrest warrant or a search warrant, it was a search made not incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.444" offset="1969194">It was a search made on the circumstances where no boat or automobile was involved that might get away.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.414" offset="2017050">There was no compelling circumstance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.779" offset="2026454">There was no activity, either of a person or a thing in this house at that particular time, and there were sufficient people available so as to guard the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.582" offset="2073684">And I say that in view of the Agnello case and the Jones form the Fifth Circuit case and the Taylor case and the Jones case, those four decisions of this Honorable Court have held that probable cause, however well-founded for belief that certain articles subject to seizure are in a dwelling house, cannot of itself justify a search without a warrant, even in circumstances where the facts unquestionably show this probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.712" offset="2214222">And in this particular case, there was only one indication, possible indication of a violation of the law and that was the smell of mash emanating from the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.524" offset="2269497">Now, the framers of the Constitution concluded or I should say, included the Fourth Amendment in our Constitution because they had learned though sad experience that the decision to search a house should not be left to the discretion of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.215" offset="2340237">But as a matter of principle, if the question must be subjected to the requirement of a previous judicial sanction wherever possible, by that is meant that there must be some compelling circumstance of some type before a law enforcement officer has the right to make the decision to search premises without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.608" offset="2445772">Now, there are five decisions of this Court that I would like to refer to now which deal with situations where there is no warrant, no arrest warrant, no search warrant and the search is made not incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.712" offset="2506271">The first is the Jeffers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.173" offset="2516093">Now, in that case, there was a search of a hotel room.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.377" offset="2532916">This was held to be illegal, although there were many indications of a violation therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.993" offset="2555382">In other words, there were noises and peeping through the keyhole and other indications emanating from the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.780" offset="2590490">And there, the petitioner was an invitee, but nevertheless, he had the proper standing to assert his rights under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.279" offset="2628524">I think it also important there to see that the facts of that case show that before entering this hotel room where no one was present and without warrant, they had permission from the manager of the hotel who was the agent of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.972" offset="2703235">They even were provided a key through the room by this manager, but in that case, the owner did not strip this individual of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.885" offset="2750882">In the Jones case from the Fifth Circuit, there was a search of a house without a warrant, without a proper warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.228" offset="2788289">In that particular case, they had obtained a daytime search warrant, but did not go into the house until after dark.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.602" offset="2825801">This Court held that that was -- was an improper search and seizure in that particular case, because even though there were -- there were members of the family of the petitioner in that case in the house at the time, they told the officers before they entered that to wait until the man of the house gets back, but they refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.860" offset="2914826">In other words, they were put on notice that the man that they were after was not in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.584" offset="2941680">Therefore, their entry was not incident to an arrest, but for the purpose to procure evidence for a future arrest, which is very similar to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.549" offset="2981595">In that particular case, there were many indications of a violation are still was running in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.560" offset="3013569">There were blowers which are normally connected with a whiskey's tale.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.289" offset="3032482">There were tubes coming from the house, hoses with mash running out, spent mash.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.851" offset="3054738">There were many, many indications and they had even obtained a daytime warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.960" offset="3075218">But under that circumstance just as here, the officers should not have entered without a proper warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.610" offset="3113775">In the Lustig case, there, we have a search of a hotel room without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.640" offset="3137912">In that particular case, there again, the agent of the owner, the manager of the hotel called and reported this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.991" offset="3175320">I might also mention that in that case, the -- the petitioner was registered under an assumed name, under a fictitious name, which might be important in view of the probable contention of the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.079" offset="3247731">But nevertheless, it was held that the petitioner did have a standing and that the search was improper without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.666" offset="3286079">In the Taylor case, the officers went to a garage and they smelled whiskey coming from that house and they broke open a door to that garage and went in and found whiskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.566" offset="3341667">This Court held that it's not important whether that garage was part of a dwelling or not, but since there was no one in there at the time and there was no reason for the officers to believe that there was somebody in there, this Court held and quite properly so that the search without a warrant was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.575" offset="3429648">So there, we have searches of hotel rooms, of garages and we -- in later instances in other cases and I will refer to have the search of barns.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.439" offset="3473115">In the Trupiano case, that case was a search of a barn.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.178" offset="3496103">The facts are quite lengthy and I don't think it's necessary for me to go into those in detail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.319" offset="3520658">But in that particular case, the arrest was made -- the entry was made incident to the arrest of one person in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.747" offset="3562350">This Court upheld the conviction of that man, but said that the evidence obtained while in there could not be used as to other men who were later arrested and prosecuted based upon the evidence found at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.219" offset="3624208">We feel that that's quite important here in the sense that even though it was incident to an arrest, it was not applicable to those people who are not there and who they sought to prosecute on that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.698" offset="3702157">Therefore, any cases are not too much in point except for sideline issues such as one that I have just mentioned where they deal with a lawful arrest or entry whether it'd be with a warrant, arrest warrant or without an arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.956" offset="3787212">In the Joines case, I think that's of interest here in order to round out our development of the case -- that's J-O-I-N-E-S.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.768" offset="3826395">There -- in that particular case, the officers had a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.688" offset="3850115">They went to the house thinking and for the purpose of arresting someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.351" offset="3868818">As it turned out, the man that they thought was there was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.853" offset="3886791">They nevertheless, were able to use that evidence because they, in good faith, searched the house, incident to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.704" offset="3934229">Now, in the Agnello case, a house was searched which was far removed from the place of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.076" offset="3967666">I think that's important here in rounding out that if it is not incident to an arrest, then you cannot go two or three blocks over, after arresting a man and search his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.753" offset="4018343">In the Rabinowitz case, there we have the search of a one-room office building, which by the way was open to the public and the search was restricted to that one room in which a man was arrested under a proper warrant of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.048" offset="4083545">In that particular case, this Court held that the law enforcement officers had the right to properly investigate, to look and to search the premises there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.815" offset="4138611">And in that particular case, it was a restricted search and this Court said that that was quite proper under those circumstances, because it was incident to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.021" offset="4187408">Now, the United States Government contends that the landlord was acting to protect his property and that he gave permission for the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.316" offset="4232652">We do not feel that the decisions that we have mentioned and we'll go into more detail on support any such contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.445" offset="4281135">Not only do the case is not supported, but the facts of this case do not support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.896" offset="4302973">In this particular case, the owner of this house went to the house, smells some mash emanating from the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.815" offset="4338604">And this is the way the facts are framed up and I think this is most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.219" offset="4360234">Instead of going immediately and calling a law enforcement officer, a general law enforcement officer to come out and help me protect my property, he didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.352" offset="4412792">He went and attended to some social business, made some social calls and then after a while when he returned to his house, he didn't' call the sheriff's department or the general law enforcement agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.129" offset="4471933">He called the state revenue agents and he said this, "If you will come out here, I will show you a still and you'll have to get here by such and such of time, because I'm going to busy after that."</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.746" offset="4538389">And then the officer did come out and picked up another officer and came out and made the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.827" offset="4562631">Now, those facts are important to show this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.328" offset="4576632">That the owner of that premises had in mind the enforcement of the liquor law and there's no indication whatsoever, but much to the contrary that he did not have in mind protecting his property or keep -- to keep waste from being committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.088" offset="4655731">Now, the decisions that I spoke of in the Trupiano case, the owner of that property, even drove the officers out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.344" offset="4692720">He was present with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.841" offset="4698781">He had worked with the officers and drove them in his automobile out to the place before the search was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.702" offset="4734203">Therefore, that case would not support the contention of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.903" offset="4754996">Now, in the Jeffers case as I have mentioned, the officers got the key to the hotel room from the manager and got his permission and the manager therefore, is the agent and the proper agent of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.003" offset="4815391">In the Lustig case, I'll mention again, the manager of the hotel called and made the report and beckoned the officers to come, very similar as to these instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.128" offset="4867845">We think that the facts of this case clearly show that this owner was not trying to protect any civil protection or afford himself several protections, but was interested in the enforcement of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.306" offset="4944645">And we say that an owner --</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Erdahl</label>
            <text syncTime="2428.913" offset="9818990">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.801" offset="9846575">First, Mr. Justice Stewart asked about the orders mentioned that the Court of Appeals did not rely on the silver platter doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.252" offset="9892342">I just want to point out that it did not -- not only did not rely on it, it disclaimed any reliance on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.362" offset="9912822">It's pointed out that the Elkins case was at the time pending here and it does not in particular, forecast the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.296" offset="9940511">I should also like to point out that there was no and heard and whatever the silver platter in the District Court's oral ruling of nine motions to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.912" offset="9999026">The Court -- the District Court pointed to the fact that this house was not a dwelling, not used -- as though the dwelling house was not used as a dwelling, rather it was used as a manufacturing establishment that it was Sunday, that there was probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.796" offset="10066526">And finally and most importantly, there is a specific finding by the District Court that the owner, Bridgaman, the landlord, told the officers that he had reason to believe that there was a still in his house and not only consented, but asked the officers to go in and see about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.128" offset="10143848">In its opinion on rehearing, denying petition for rehearing, the Court of Appeals said they did have in its opinion of affirmance, emphasized -- I'll read it, "In view of the emphasis we -- which we've placed on the fact that the entry was a Bridgaman's request, we think it's appropriate to answer petitioner's contention that the Court placed too much emphasis upon Bridgaman's request and the Court alluded to the testimony of Chance, the state revenue agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.468" offset="10289194">Question, "And did the owner, Mr. Bridgaman tell you to go in there and see about it and see what was in his house?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.227" offset="10312286">Answer, "That's right," and the Court said, "The trial court so found" that is found the consent and request and that the evidence amply supported the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.807" offset="10378637">Before I leave that, I would like to also point to the testimony of -- the further testimony of officer Chance which the Court will find on page 13 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.869" offset="10442898">This one sentence in his testimony sums it all up very neatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.923" offset="10459094">He was asked about why he didn't get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.213" offset="10480201">He said, it was Sunday, "Well, can't you get a search warrant on Sunday?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.294" offset="10500577">He said, "I've never gotten one on Sunday."</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.256" offset="10516355">"You didn't make any attempt to get any search warrant, did you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.171" offset="10528057">Then Chance answered this -- this way, "Well, I didn't feel no call to get one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.303" offset="10552613">The man that owned the house, he was there and he told us to go in, in the window" and see what's -- what in there, and that should be -- what's -- printing error, what's what or what was in there, so he went on in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.323" offset="10620635">Now, that puts the issue here in focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.652" offset="10646026">My opponent says that this has -- but another case of and a -- a police entry into protected premises upon probable cause without more and he -- he called the rule of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.952" offset="10731186">He would have it that -- the fact that Bridgaman, the landlord was there and as the District Court found, not only consented, but requested that the officers go in and have no consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.555" offset="10801612">Now, we say that Bridgaman's presence there and his authorization makes all the difference in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.575" offset="10833690">I feel like I can fairly say that if he had not been present and given his authorization, if the police had on their own gone in, we would not be here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="5236.422" offset="21049031">I refer to Burdeau against McDowell, the case in which McDowell's papers were taken out of his office by private persons without his authorization and the Court said that -- and they were turned over to the United States Attorney for prosecutions, for presentation to agree in jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.364" offset="21132831">The Court said, "We're not going to stop to consider the wrong done to McDowell or what his rights or remedies maybe against the wrongdoer."</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.201" offset="21172224">In the McGuire case, the agents had a warrant, search warrant, for liquor and when they executed the warrant, they kept to court and destroyed all the rest and it was claimed that this made them trespasser ab initio, because the destruction, their act of destroying the liquor was illegal and the Court agreed to before it and oppressed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.159" offset="21275982">But the Court said, "This doesn't affect the validity of the search for and the seizure of and retention of the Court be kept."</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.990" offset="21315375">They said that was valid, that was distinct from the civil wrong, the wrong done in destroying.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.016" offset="21351424">And more recently, in On Lee, the Court reiterated that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.311" offset="21376606">It was their claim that you recall, that was the case of the informer who went in wired the sound, radio transmitter into On Lee's Laundry and engaged them in conversation, he was a friend of On Lee and On Lee made the incriminating statements, which were picked up on the radio and heard by an agent outside who had the receiving sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.187" offset="21468139">And it was contended there that on -- the informer was either a -- a trespasser ab initio or he was a trespasser when he went in, because the entry was fraudulent as against On Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.183" offset="21532087">And the Court said there that the McGuire case controls the question and that what -- whether -- whether the informer's conduct was unlawful or not, this did not affect the Government's right to use the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.962" offset="21619231">And I think that this case is an even stronger case for the application of that principle because there, the informer who was guilty of betraying his friend's confidence was acting under the auspices of agents who sent him in wired for sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="5991.662" offset="24070040">And would it not be stripping away the individual rights of those tenants in the various housing projects throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.689" offset="24114134">I -- I think that it is -- would be too far reaching and would really be a question that this Court is not going to allow, the rights of individuals to be stripped away in that manner.</text>
