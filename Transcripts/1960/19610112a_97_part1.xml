            <text syncTime="36.839" offset="250755">This case can be put in quick focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.104" offset="267786">A civilian, non-governmental employee works as a short-order cook at a cafeteria located on the premises of the Gun Factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.515" offset="317419">She works for a civilian, non-governmental employer who operates the cafeteria pursuant to a contract with the Gun Factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.105" offset="363813">The Superintendent of the Gun Factory and his Security Officer calls the short-order cook to lose her job because she allegedly fails to meet security requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.821" offset="426611">There is no disclosure of what the security requirements constitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.115" offset="447822">There is no statement of reasons particularizing the respects in which the employee allegedly fails to meet them.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.299" offset="480528">And there is no hearing of any kind at which to know or meet the evidence supporting the bare conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.620" offset="517831">Our question is whether such action by governmental officers is authorized and if authorized, whether it is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.875" offset="566836">What happened here?</text>
            <text syncTime="118.011" offset="575404">On November 15th, 1956, the employer operated three main cafeterias on the premises of the Naval Gun Factory, government land.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.036" offset="631515">He operated those cafeterias pursuant to an Agreement with the Board of Governors of the Naval Gun Factory cafeterias, a group of seven civilian governmental employees appointed by the Superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.692" offset="690134">One of the provisions of that Agreement said this, "In no event shall the Concessionaire engage or continue to engage for operations under this Agreement, personnel who failed to meet the security requirements or other requirements under applicable regulations of the Activity, as determined by the Security Officer of the Activity."</text>
            <text syncTime="176.465" offset="809253">The employees working at those cafeterias were represented by the petitioner Union in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.522" offset="841435">The Union had been certified as the exclusive representative in 1942 by the National Labor Relations Board and collective bargaining agreements have entered ever -- into ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.156" offset="888038">Each collective bargaining agreement contained the provision that no employee shall be suspended or discharged without good and sufficient cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.721" offset="934222">On November 15th, 1956, one of the employees working there was a person named Rachel Brawner, who worked as a short-order cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.637" offset="977899">She had worked at that shop -- at that cafeteria for six and one-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.764" offset="1002454">She was a first-rate employee whose performance of work was never questioned as being altogether satisfactory.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.323" offset="1072671">I think that when a person has had a job for six and a half years, it goes a rather a long way to say that the loss of that job is not an injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.938" offset="1531173">On November 15th, 1956, as I said, she was working as a short-order cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.715" offset="1554265">The day before, the secretary treasurer of the Board of Governors notified a Mr. Baker, who was the supervisor of the cafeteria employees and he told Mr. Baker that you have -- you're going to have to pick up the identification badge of Rachel Brawner, the Security Officer has told her she is a security risk and she -- and he requires that her badge be surrendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.014" offset="1655411">The next day, Rachel Brawner was relieved from her job at the cafeteria and she reported to the office of Mr. Baker and in her words, this is what happened at that office.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.827" offset="1906709">And this is what Mr. Baker said, naturally, it upset her a great deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.096" offset="1927711">I could not tell her anything except I had been directed to take such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.288" offset="1948505">I tried to explain to her the several steps which I thought might be possible for her to follow, including going to the Security Officer himself and to the Superintendent and of course, I told her to see Mr. Palmer, her business agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.657" offset="3790033">We think that this case is controlled by Greene v. McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.119" offset="3819813">The navy personnel instructions which we quote on page 30 of our brief, in which the respondents quote at page 29 of their brief, say this, "The services operated by concessionaires are classed as private enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.022" offset="3895463">They acquire none of the status of a government instrumentality and their employees have the same legal status as do the employees of any private employer."</text>
            <text syncTime="961.507" offset="3949380">This Court, in Greene v. McElroy decided the status of a private employee of a private employer, whose employment was adversely affected on security grounds by the Secretary of Defense or his subordinates.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.546" offset="4013537">This Court held that in the absence of explicit authorization for either the President or Congress, the respondents were not empowered to deprive petitioner of his job in a proceeding in which he was not afforded the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.922" offset="4099009">We have a case therefore, in which an employee who has access to classified information and who has been given a limited hearing, may nevertheless not have his -- lose his employment on the basis of such a limited hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.599" offset="4161808">In this case, we are told that though such an employee cannot lose his employment, an employee with no access to classified information and without any hearing at all, may nevertheless, lose her job on security grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.436" offset="4229099">We think that turns things upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.060" offset="4247594">There are three distinctions suggested, of course, the first in Greene, there was a -- no authority and here, there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.401" offset="4276955">The second, William Greene was an aeronautical engineer and Rachel Brawner is a cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.795" offset="4302555">William Greene couldn't work as an aeronautical engineer once the security clearance was taken from him, Rachel Brawner can work as a cook here and everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.761" offset="4350412">William Greene worked on private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.156" offset="4363995">Rachel Waner -- Brawner worked on government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.061" offset="4383640">Let's look at the distinctions, let's take authority first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.358" offset="4404851">In Greene, there was at least explicit departmental authority for the action taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.871" offset="4430869">In this case, there is not even departmental authority shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.817" offset="4454588">Now, an oral argument is no place for the meticulous tracing of regulations, but I want to make only two points with respect to the lack of even departmental authority for the action taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.015" offset="4499414">Respondents agreed that if Rachel Brawner, working on the premises of the Gun Factory, had had access to classified information, she would at least, have gotten the limited hearing under the regulation which this Court invalidated in Greene v. McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.610" offset="4569840">Yet, they say she is not entitled to even this limited hearing because she has no access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.324" offset="4600665">We think this turn -- turns things upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.881" offset="4614875">A regulation which requires that an employee with access to classified information be given at least a limited hearing, cannot conceivably be read to authorize no hearing as to an employee with no access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.098" offset="4675793">We think the inference from the departmental regulation itself is that such employees are to be let alone and they are to be let alone for the very good reason that they have no access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.595" offset="4733785">And we are told, however, that throughout the history of this country, military commanders have done as they please with respect to civilian presence on governmental land and departmental usage is therefore, the basis for our departmental authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.429" offset="4805047">The most I get from the showing is that military personnel have told each other so often that they can do as they please with respect to civilian presence on governmental land that they have to come to believe it must be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.598" offset="4865755">But even what they show does not in the least relate to security clearance and as the denial of a job on that basis and it could not, because security clearance and the denial of a job on that basis is a relatively recent invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.223" offset="4932315">There is no history to appeal to with respect to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.724" offset="4950288">But interestingly enough, respondents' own showing indicates that an insurance salesman who solicits business on a military post cannot be excluded from that post without being given an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.527" offset="5021445">An insurance company cannot have its representatives excluded from the post on the basis of misconduct of the representatives without giving the insurance company an opportunity to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.491" offset="5077347">Well, if insurance salesmen have an opportunity to be heard and insurance companies an opportunity to explain, I can hardly imagine the existence of departmental authority by which private employees may lose their jobs and be stigmatized their security risks without any hearing at all and with no chance to explain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.255" offset="7832430">This Union represents 2600 employees in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.379" offset="7852910">2000 of them worked in governmental cafeterias.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.168" offset="7872031">Those 2000 jobs are closed to Rachel Brawner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.166" offset="7888018">She cannot work as a short-order cook in any cafeteria located in any governmental building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.720" offset="7914245">Let me read what the business agent said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.265" offset="7980387">An employee, I read from page 91 of our brief, who may be discharged as a security risk has not a ghost of a chance of getting a job in a government cafeteria and it is very difficult to obtain employment for any employee who has that tag on them in any cafeteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.739" offset="8062307">If the actual extent of the injury were material, a trial would show that Rachel Brawner in the last four years has been able to work only half of the full time available to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.310" offset="8112567">In the six and one-half years preceding that, she worked fulltime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.402" offset="8132942">Now, an injury which results in depriving an employee of half of the income he would otherwise have gotten seems to me to be injury enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.624" offset="8261883">And they say, "The only reason that was ever published or publicized is that she sought to protect her interests."</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.609" offset="8281840">And so presumably, we should not have began a lawsuit in order to protect her interest because, by that means, the community would not have known that she had been discharged as a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.438" offset="8337115">We think it's fair to say that the jobs which circuit judges think are -- are available here and everywhere for short-order cooks, are somewhat more difficult for business agents of unions to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.039" offset="8395525">And the tag on the employee that she was a security risk is itself, an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.018" offset="8419453">The community does not distinguish between loyalty and security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.795" offset="8434604">If an employee has that talk -- tag on him, he has been hurt and that's annoying wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.906" offset="8458951">We're told two things, however, on the question of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.647" offset="8485909">We're told, "Well, the employer, after he discharged her, offered her employment at another place he operated in Virginia."</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.418" offset="8517047">What difference does that make?</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.564" offset="8525615">Would this case be different if the employer had no other place that he was running?</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.994" offset="8547349">Would this case be different if though he had another place, he didn't choose to give her employment there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.570" offset="8573680">And in any event, she didn't take that other job, the record shows, because it was an unsatisfactory location.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.997" offset="8607326">And if it were material, we could show conclusively that it has been satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.121" offset="8631881">To the extent that public transportation is even available to that job, it takes three hours to get to and from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.606" offset="8661765">It takes a $1.60 in transportation fare to get to and from their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.251" offset="8684335">If she were earning the same rate of pay at that new place that she had at the old place, she was getting a $1.18 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.198" offset="8716204">We don't think a satisfactory job is one which it takes three hours to get to and from and which takes 17% of your income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.635" offset="8749955">We have another curious distinction that is suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.699" offset="8766151">The same employer no longer operates the cafeterias as to what operated them at the time of her discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.769" offset="8794467">There is now a new concessionaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.230" offset="8804289">This new concessionaire has agreed, has promised to put Rachel Brawner back to work with full seniority rights, but this doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.283" offset="8836472">She is still now in the position of trying to get a new job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.714" offset="8854235">She's not trying to protect her old job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.291" offset="8868551">Well, there's nothing new about the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.100" offset="8875760">His job is still the same old job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.567" offset="8885687">The only thing that's new is the corporate employing entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.750" offset="8902405">And even if it were true that even analytically, one could say she's trying to get a new job, not retaining her old job, we, like the Ninth Circuit, think that although employment of which plaintiffs were deprived, was prospective only if their rights to earn a livelihood like that in Truax v. Raich was entitled to protection at the hands of a court of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.213" offset="9004178">We think that getting a job is as important as keeping a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.784" offset="9026539">So we get to the last distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.722" offset="9038242">This was governmental land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.440" offset="9049109">William Greene worked on private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.102" offset="9063737">On this premise, had William Greene worked as an aeronautical engineer of the premises of the Naval Gun Factory, he could've lost his job, his employment opportunities could've been destroyed, his reputation could've been besmirched not on the basis of a limited hearing, but with no hearing at all and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.481" offset="9141269">Because he worked on governmental premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.374" offset="9164884">I had not understood that just because the act takes place on governmental land, that a governmental officer may act without authority and I had not understood that the Constitution stops at the entrance to a naval installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.824" offset="9230712">If the issue of governmental land were indeed relevant, that would have been the short answer to a long line of cases which state and federal governments have lost when public employees sought to regain their jobs which they had lost because of failure to meet so-called security requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.374" offset="9308871">The federal employees who lost their jobs because the governmental officers exceeded their authority could have been -- could have been told, "You work on government -- worked in governmental buildings, we can keep anybody out of a governmental building we choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.554" offset="9361638">It doesn't matter that the labor view has a security risk without any authority."</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.174" offset="9496116">I think that may not be true where you have a governmental building in which there is no access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.527" offset="9529448">But I can conceive it to be relevant only in terms of protection of classified information, but I cannot conceive that whether it is a governmental building like the National Labor Relations Board occupies or the Naval Gun Factory that the military occupies that on the issue of authority to act in the first place or constitutional authority to act if we get to that, that the mere existence of a military land as distinguished from other land can make a difference.</text>
