            <text syncTime="52.530" offset="313448">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.507" offset="337377">This is the second stage of the antitrust proceeding relating to du Pont's acquisition of 63 million shares of the stock of General Motors Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.393" offset="404982">Four years ago, this Court held that this acquisition was a -- was in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.101" offset="443747">The present issue is what relief should be granted in order to cure this violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.396" offset="473004">And most specifically the question is, whether the decree of the court below which transferred the voting rights in the 63 million shares from du Pont to its stockholders, the decree also eliminating interlocking directors and enjoining specific business relationships between the two corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.390" offset="572897">The question is whether this decree gives adequate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.967" offset="595257">The Government argues that the illegal acquisition should be undone by ordering a surrender of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.350" offset="644786">This is a rare case in that one of the parties has tried to frighten the courts into deciding a corporate case its way by asserting that disaster will follow the divestiture and by parading a long list of expert witnesses, du Pont presents an in terrorem argument as to why it should not make a clean break with its past.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.036" offset="771532">These are the same tactics which were employed in opposing the enforcement of the Public Utility Holding Company Act many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.197" offset="812178">And there, they met with no success.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.730" offset="826284">The truth of the matter is that there is nothing of inherent value which is taken away when one untangles one of this corporate (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="191.716" offset="870275">Once the illegal advantage would -- is the object of the statute to prohibit is removed, then the corporate relationship is in effect excess baggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.585" offset="921684">And in the end, all of the participants will gain by dividing -- by simplifying the corporate structure and separating it into its component parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.645" offset="961912">And that is what we purpose should be done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.059" offset="979571">Merely four years ago when the Court determined that the du Pont investment -- the du Pont holdings were in violation of Section 7 of the -- of the Clayton Act, it sent the case back to the District Court with instructions to the Court frame and appropriate decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.639" offset="1057938">The Government told the District Court that it believe that the only adequate decree must require divestiture of the acquired stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.513" offset="1105377">And when the Court requested that the -- that the Government present a specific plan, the Government presented a plan in which it suggested that the stock should be divested over a period of 10 years by the declaration of the G. M. stock as dividends to its own stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.205" offset="1188237">It proposed that the stock which would have been allocable to the two du Pont holding companies, Delaware Investment and -- Realty &amp; Investment and Christiana Securities should be sold by trustees in order to prevent a continuation of any influence through these two holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.555" offset="1265560">It proposed that there should be a -- an outlying of interlocking directors and offices and it did propose certain -- that certain transactions between the two companies be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.750" offset="1314356">The Internal -- the Internal Revenue Service advised that the declaration of the General Motors stock as dividends would be taxable to the recipients as ordinary income rather than as a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.973" offset="1383215">This plan proposed by the Government was opposed by du Pont, by General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.548" offset="1409546">It's opposed by Christiana -- Christiana and Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.416" offset="1425011">It was also opposed by two amicus curiae who were appointed by the District Court to represent the interest of the stockholders of General Motors and of du Pont stockholders as such.Du Pont and the amici proposed plans under which du Pont would keep the stock but would transfer the voting rights to its stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.669" offset="1534098">This would mean that each du Pont's stockholder would be given a permanent proxy to vote about 1-1/3 shares of General Motors stock in addition to power he had with respect to his own du Pont stock, under this plan to interlocking directors and officers which --</text>

            <text syncTime="449.702" offset="1902216">The District Court published its opinion in October of 1959 followed by its decree a month later.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.718" offset="1950281">In general, it accepted the -- the du Pont General Motors' proposals rather than the Government's proposal, not in detail but in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.881" offset="1982882">It provided that General Motors could -- that du Pont could continue to hold the stock of -- of General Motors, but did require that the votes to be passed on to the stockholders, except that it further provided that the votes which would have been passed on to Delaware and to Christiana and to the officers of those two companies should be sterilized, no one should exercise that vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.449" offset="2097194">It also provided for outlying, interlocking to officers and directors.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.692" offset="2218088">And the decree also included the provision under which the Government could reapproach the Court for additional relief in case there was any change in the tax law or in the case it was demonstrated that the decree was not being effective to -- to terminate the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.896" offset="2306905">Now, we believe that this decree provided inadequate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.636" offset="2329893">And I pose to divide my argument roughly into -- into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.142" offset="2351940">First, I will argue that divestiture is the remedy required by the statute for violations of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.065" offset="2403662">And second, I shall argue that the Court's order provides inadequate relief in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.367" offset="2440861">And then third place, I shall argue that divestiture can be achieved without the undue hardships which the appellees claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.355" offset="2520795">If it's a required relief, why, the Court would have to issue it whether the adequate relief could be given under the other and whether or not it caused hardships.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.513" offset="2561442">So that these are really in the alternative, the second too, in alternative to the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.222" offset="2604283">This -- this particular proceeding was commenced under Section 15 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.786" offset="2634480">And in -- and on my first point, the question is whether Section 15 of the Clayton Act requires -- in itself requires divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.857" offset="2682755">Section 15 is quoted at page 5 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.826" offset="2694666">It is not particularly helpful on this question because it is stated in very general language.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="669.464" offset="2781184">It is natural that it was stated in these general terms because of the fact that it is the general enforcement -- provision which supplies not only to Section 7, which deals with ownership of stock, but deals with Section 8 which deals with interlocking directories and it deals with the other sections of the Clayton Act which involved price discrimination in other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.769" offset="2866448">Some help, however, can be -- can be had in the proper interpretation of Section 15 from Section 11 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.742" offset="2906363">Section 11 of the Act is a section which authorizes various administrative commissions to enforce the Clayton Act, the -- the Federal Trade Commission, the Commerce Commission, the Federal and the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.042" offset="2975535">And in connection with those proceedings which are commenced through the administrative commissions, it is specifically provided that after they hold the hearing and find the facts, if they find the violation, they shall issue an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such violations and divest himself of the stock held.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.858" offset="3066755">In other words, Section 11 is mandatory in its language as to the relief which should be granted for a violation of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.141" offset="3107924">It would seem to me that there would have to be some very persuasive reason why Congress would give a different method of relief in Section 15 and in Section 11 if it did not intend that the same procedure -- the same relief should be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.438" offset="3185142">Also, I think it helps in construing Section 15 to know that it is in terms -- is lifted verbatim from the Sherman Act, from Section 4 of the Sherman Act, I think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.042" offset="3235506">So, one would assume that when Congress took the very language from the Sherman Act and put it in the Clayton Act, that Congress might very well have intended that there should be the same relief granted under the Clayton Act which had previously been granted by the courts under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.748" offset="3322337">And it is a fact that in this merger type of violation, the Sherman Act covers many other types of violation but in this merger type of violation, the relief, which has always been granted under the Sherman Act, is divestiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.700" offset="11282160">Now, I come to the next argument that the innocent stockholders are going to suffer disastrous loses because of the drop in market values of both General Motors and du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.662" offset="11333987">In a minute, I shall deal with the -- with the merits of this, but for the present, let me accept the appellees evidence at its full value just for the purposes of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.471" offset="11381217">Their evidence is that divestiture under the Government's plan, that is, the through -- through dividends -- through declaring dividends of the General Motors stock that the divestiture would impair General Motors the -- market value of General Motors stock to the extent of 20% to 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.784" offset="11458539">And that it would impair the value of the du Pont stock market wise 25% to 30%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.600" offset="11493752">Now, no one wants to depress stock market values to any extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.340" offset="11516740">But even if this drop should occur, I suggest that it's not the other disaster that the appellees would have you believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.787" offset="11558536">During the year 1960, General Motors fell off 27% from its high of the year to the low of the year, and du Pont dropped 33% from the high of the year to the low of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.926" offset="11631052">The innocent stockholders, so far as I know, haven't treated this as a disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.611" offset="11649860">I mean no one is happy to see his stock go down, but the way -- the way you make it appear as a disaster is to take this -- take this drop in stock market values and -- and multiply it by the number of shares outstanding and you get the astronomical figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.755" offset="11710360">But actually -- actually, there are fluctuations up and down in the stock market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.300" offset="11736586">What -- so that even if we accept their argument that there will be this drop in this -- in the -- in the stockmarket, it -- it isn't a factor which should frighten us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.549" offset="11781517">I mean it's something that we may want to avoid that we can but it's something that isn't, by itself, disastrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.416" offset="11813073">As a matter of fact, stockholders, of course, when they -- when they buy common stock, pick the chances of gains and losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.942" offset="11847137">It doesn't really make much difference to them whether the loss occurs because of an antitrust decree or bad weather or an international disturbances -- disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.734" offset="11882350">As a matter of fact, as far as the antitrust decree goes, it may be less serious to them because in that case, as here, nothing is taken away from their corporation's earnings or -- or dividends other than the dividends of separating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.142" offset="11947969">But nothing is done to the business entities so that they cannot continue to earn same kind of -- of profits that happened before and the stock market is thereupon not reflecting inherent worth, it's merely reflecting a matter of supply and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.975" offset="12019231">This isn't much comfort if they have to sell immediately but it is some comfort if they are like the big trust and so forth that can just -- just hold on and let the -- whatever market disturbance there is right itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.395" offset="12076910">But I think that the argument that the General Motors and the du Pont stock will fall off 20% to 30% by reason of divestiture is, on its face, unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.238" offset="12128319">General Motors' earnings -- well, earnings and the $2 dividend which is paid over the past few years will not be affected by this decree in any material effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.610" offset="12181817">And nether will du Pont's earnings or its dividend except that General Motors is taken out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.853" offset="12210761">Now, to me, it's -- it's inconceivable that private and institutional investors which are for primarily concern with the yield of stocks would fail to come into the market and buy in very large volume, if the price of General Motors fails so that you could get a yield of 5.5% or 6% on -- on a blue-chip investment like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.458" offset="12313161">The record is replete with evidence as to the interest of particularly institutional investors of growing interest in -- in equity securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.367" offset="12348792">And if -- if they have a chance to -- to buy either one of these securities that are rate rather produced between 5.5% and 6%, it seems clear to me that they will -- will come in and this will -- will -- seems obvious would stop the fall of this stock façade of what the -- the appellees would have its belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.856" offset="12462791">The testimony of the appellees' experts which led the District Court to accept the theory that there would be disastrous falls in the market price was specifically addressed to a particular plan of divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.108" offset="12539800">Now, we point out in our brief on this appeal that there are various combinations of divestiture which should be left open to the -- to the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.410" offset="12592985">And we believe that if they are given the -- the freedom and if they really put their shoulder to the wheel that they will be able to avoid some of these difficulties which they foresee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.063" offset="12635617">For example on the tax consequences, if they substitute their du Pont -- their General Motors dividend for part of their present cash dividend, so that instead of paying $2 -- instead of paying $6.50 dividends, they now pay $4 in cash and $2.50 in -- in stock, there will be no increase in the income tax burden on the -- on the du Pont stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.654" offset="12745958">They will have the same overall cash burden that they had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.547" offset="12777514">The company can, if it -- if it will, sell a good part of the stock either through private placements, perhaps to General Motors, perhaps to other purchases or it can make a secondary distribution as was so successfully done with the slowing stock in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.336" offset="12864763">And I think even more important, General Motors can, if it wish, divest itself of a very considerable portion of this stock by making exchange office of the General Motors stock to its own stockholders in return for their stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.340" offset="12940727">Now, this will have the obvious advantage that it will reduce their capitalization more or less in proportion to the -- to the reduced -- reduction in -- in the assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.469" offset="13473207">So it's been determined that this will be divested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.019" offset="13487417">And the plan proposed by Delaware and Christiana for divesting this -- these 300 shares of -- of Hercules Powder is through making an exchange offer to the -- to the stockholders of -- of Christiana.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh B. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3491.866" offset="14070888">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.986" offset="14087293">I should like to begin by addressing myself to the question whether the judgment which the District Court entered in this case after a flow hearing and in the exercise of its equitable discretion is an effective judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.850" offset="14170781">We submit it is effective because it complies with a mandate of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.919" offset="14203068">It removes the -- eliminates the effects of this stock acquisition that are offensive to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.728" offset="14242252">Now, I am aware that logically, perhaps I should begin this argument with -- by considering the question whether it's divestiture of the complete legal title is mandatory as a matter of law in every Section 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.253" offset="14316335">I do propose to deal with that question but with the Court's permission, I -- I should prefer to have that -- to defer that question until I can put the question of this judgement, what it is and what it does, the question of its effectiveness, before the Court, because I think that the two things are so related that perhaps the second question might better be deferred until I have explained our position on the first, realizing that, of course, if it's mandatory, as a matter law, that there'd be complete divestiture of the legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.020" offset="14467427">That's the end of the case because the judge below didn't order complete divestiture of the legal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.649" offset="14493968">Now, I should like to supplement very briefly in few respects the description that counsel for the appellant gave of the judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.950" offset="14531166">As he said, the judgment, in the first instance, divested du Pont of any right to vote 63 million shares of General Motors which it owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.755" offset="14578395">It can't vote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.317" offset="14584665">It can't influence anybody else in the way that he shall vote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.257" offset="14604413">The judgment, as counsel said, passes those votes on to the du Pont stockholders except that no votes can be exercise by the officers and directors of du Pont or by Christiana or by their officers and directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.705" offset="14674213">The judgment does more than really simply abolish interlocking directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.136" offset="14703888">What the judgment does is it provided a period of grace of 90 days in which anybody who was on both boards had to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.019" offset="14743489">Everyone who was on both boards resigned from one of the others so that there are no interlocking directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.712" offset="14770239">That is the usual interlocking director provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.024" offset="14783509">But this judgement goes beyond them because it provides that if, after that 90-day period, a man has ever on the board or an officer of du Pont Company, he cannot, ever again, by resigning from the du Pont Company, qualify himself to be an officer or a director of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.315" offset="14860622">And the same thing works the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.915" offset="14871071">So that after the 90-day period, as far as the officers and directors are concern, there is a clean and absolute and permanent rate, there could no be shifting back and forth by resignations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.888" offset="14922898">That's the end of that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.476" offset="14937318">As far as the injunctive provisions of the judgment are concerned, I think it's worthwhile to say that those provisions enjoining all contracts require when it comes to the relation of all contracts which -- under which General Motors might buy any percentage no matter how small of its requirements of any commodity from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.224" offset="15028224">For three years, no contracts of that kind at all can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.561" offset="15045569">After three years, a contract of that kind can be made if it's limited to one year or to one model car year.</text>

            <text syncTime="3764.281" offset="15160508">The injunctive provisions forbid any exclusive granting of patent rights by one company to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.013" offset="15199378">They forbid General Motors from giving du Pont any -- exclusive right to exploit or manufacture or develop any chemical discovery that's made by General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.544" offset="15245563">They forbid General Motors to deal on any basis with du Pont to that all for first du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.214" offset="15276178">And then there is another provision in which I -- we think it was improperly included in the judgement but we haven't appealed which specifically enjoins du Pont from giving any favors to General Motors, in its dealings with General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.743" offset="15346395">Now, I should like to invite the Court's attention to those provisions of the judgement which operate directly upon the stock, not these injunctive provisions that I have been speaking of but the stock provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.271" offset="15412433">It is our position that -- that the -- what those provisions do is to deprive du Pont of every right and privilege and power that is inherit in stock ownership that might be used or that by -- might, by its mere existence, had any capacity to control or to influence General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.384" offset="15516923">I should have suppose until this issue arose today that everyone would agree that the capacity of the stockholder, capacity of the stockholder influence or control corporate action depends ultimately upon his capacity to exercise, in one way or another, voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.330" offset="15604694">That is what appellant heretofore has always argued in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.573" offset="15629667">When the case was here before, appellant argued that du Pont could control or influence General Motors because du Pont voted 23% of the stock of the stockholders' meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.959" offset="15679195">It's frequently a very large percentage of the stock present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.538" offset="15697481">That that right to vote gave du Pont representation on the Board of Directors of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.679" offset="15722036">That it gave it representation on the Committees of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.548" offset="15737605">And indeed that it give it representation in the management of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.780" offset="15762474">Those were the arguments that were made by appellant, an argument which it prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.872" offset="15786820">Now, I invite the Court's attention to the fact that each one of those things is going into this judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.051" offset="15815555">Du Pont can't vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.753" offset="15822346">It can't have anybody on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.271" offset="15828407">It can't have anyone who is an officer or a director.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.544" offset="15845543">It can't serve on the Committees of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.709" offset="15854216">It can't influence through that stock ownership the conduct of General Motors in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.653" offset="15905938">I should like to -- now, I point out that when the -- what is left here, so far as the du Pont Company is concerned, is a legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.481" offset="15957347">And I think it's useful for us to -- to consider what that title means in terms of control or influence of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.832" offset="15994650">Title itself, of course, is an abstraction that means a bundle of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.821" offset="16010637">Now, what are the rights and privileges that are elected?</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.102" offset="16023803">Well, in the first place du Pont, under this judgement, can sell its stock provided it gets the approval of the Court and provided appellant doesn't object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.725" offset="16062255">But that's not a right that can be used to influence or control General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.992" offset="16083362">In the second place, if there is a liquidation or dissolution of General Motors, du Pont, by virtue of this legal title, could share pro rata in the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.139" offset="16119933">Well, I think everyone will agree that's of no practical consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.346" offset="16136756">Now, the third thing is that du Pont continues to receive dividends on the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.620" offset="16165804">Two points I should like to make about those dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.555" offset="16181582">In the first place, so far as this is important to consider whether du Pont can control or influence General Motors, I suggest that the fact that General Motors pays du Pont dividends in exactly the same way, in the same amount that it pays every other stockholder of General Motors, certainly doesn't give du Pont any capacity to control or to influence General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.742" offset="16286386">The other comment I should like to make is, that -- and this I -- I feel and perhaps it's not apparent known to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.357" offset="16320763">It has been that consistent practice of du Pont for years to pass the amount of those dividends on to its own shareholders less the amount of the intercorporate dividend tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.868" offset="16374888">Du Pont is merely a conduit to those dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.417" offset="16388995">That practical situation isn't any different than it would be, if, really, General Motors, to some arrangement, even under an order of the Court, paid the dividends directly to the shareholders of du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.809" offset="16442598">Now, counsel for the appellant has referred to fact that the amount of dividends that are paid to du Pont and that are passed on by du Pont to its shareholders is very substantial, and that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.078" offset="16495679">But I ask the Court, what does that have to do with the violation of law that was found in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.224" offset="16520234">What relationship is there between those payments and the probability that there may be some restraints or monopolization of trade?</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.580" offset="16553671">The mere receipt of that money, I think, from the face of it, has no relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.688" offset="16578121">It creates no possibility or threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.274" offset="16588466">Restraint particularly in view of the facts to dividends had been direct and passed on to shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.813" offset="16614588">There is no suggestion of the fact to the presented testimony in the court below that that's what du Pont intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.178" offset="16648129">Now, oddly enough, the plaintiff, although it talks the appellant or it talks about the dividends here, didn't ask for any relief as to the dividends in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.642" offset="16693896">So that -- that is what the judgement leaves in the du Pont Company and most -- it's a sterile kind of investment which is deprived of any capacity or power, we submit, to influence or to control General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.545" offset="16753560">Now, what -- what does the appellant say in criticism of this judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.265" offset="16772472">Well, it first makes the point that was made this afternoon that the stockholders of du Pont who are entitled to exercise these voting rights on 15% of the stock may act in the concerts or they may follow some common program or perhaps in management of General Motors will fear that they will do so and will act accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.046" offset="16879574">Now, I -- the appellant -- we press the appellant on this point in order to be more precise about this in our brief and in its reply brief at page 9, the comment it made was this, that even if the shareholders didn't act in concert and didn't go to the stockholders' meeting with any prearranged plan, they could ask questions which would be very troublesome and difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.744" offset="16982392">I really think we are entitled to somewhat more precise argument than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.507" offset="17001409">Does appellant mean that by this independent questions at the stockholders' meeting, the management of General Motors is going to be intimated or coerced into buying paint from du Pont even it doesn't want to buy or it doesn't mean that the stockholders unorganized their 200,000 of -- are going to conduct a proxy campaign for the opening of a valid purpose of removing the management of General Motors because it won't buy paint from du Pont?</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.282" offset="17116453">I think -- I submit to the Court, when you state these arguments with any degree of precision and look at them in terms of practicalities, they fall of their own weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.711" offset="17166190">Now, there is another argument or -- or group of arguments which -- before I leave that subject let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.420" offset="17193044">Of course, if there is any danger, we think there isn't, but if there is any danger in this exercise of voting rights by the stockholders of the du Pont Company, it does not require this divestiture of the legal title to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.450" offset="17269217">I think that perhaps appellant's counsel this afternoon, in effect, conceded that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.952" offset="17291160">You could adopt measures that would prevent the stock from being voted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.443" offset="17313102">Or you could, as an alternative, you could provide that it should be voted as a mechanical administrative matter in exactly the same percentages that the other 76% of the stock is voted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.909" offset="17358973">And if that should be done, we don't think it's necessary, we are not advocating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.143" offset="17379976">We think it's preferable to the divestiture of the legal title because it will not have the consequences to the stockholders of the two companies that divestiture would.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.704" offset="17414144">But if that should be done, it would remove completely any possibility that the exercise of voting rights by 200,000 diverse and independent shareholders could have any effect upon the practices of General Motors.</text>

            <text syncTime="4502.597" offset="18113808">It will hold a legal tittle to this stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.348" offset="18128750">Appellant argues that because of this financial interest, there will be some tendency, possibility or probability that General Motors will favor du Pont in their commercial dealings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.833" offset="18186742">For example, that it will continue to buy paint from du Pont instead of buying it from competitive sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.532" offset="18225507">Now, here, again, we press appellant in our brief to be specific and in response, appellant made two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.885" offset="18258944">One of which has been made here this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.096" offset="18271796">That is the argument that if in the future, Chevrolet, for example, should decide to stop buying paint from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.838" offset="18310771">And again, buying paint from General Motors, these 200,000 shareholders of the du Pont Company or all the shareholders of du Pont Company would stop buying Chevrolet cars because they were annoyed by the change of the paint's suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.585" offset="18393736">Now, I'm not sure how much I should say about that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.815" offset="18406588">It -- it seems to me to assume or rather extraordinary situation or make extraordinary assumptions about the buying habits of the American public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.830" offset="18446712">As I understand the argument, it -- it posits a situation like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.129" offset="18463848">Chevrolet salesman goes around to a prospective customer and says, "I would like to sell you a Chevrolet."</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.490" offset="18489344">And the customer says, "Alright, now, before I ask you anything else about this car or before you tell me anything about it, I want to know who makes the paint on the car because I'm the shareholder of the du Pont Company and I'm interested in that."</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.574" offset="18545664">Now, I don't know what the salesman would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.552" offset="18553605">I think in reality, he would probably say, "Well, look, brother, I don't know who made the paint but I could tell you one thing, it's a very good paint."</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.615" offset="18581817">But let's assume that he knows everything about the paint that a plant superintendent of the Chevrolet Company knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.382" offset="18604910">And then he would say, "Well, it is true, they use to buy that paint from du Pont."</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.985" offset="18623300">But now, that's a little different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.121" offset="18631868">The -- the topcoat on this car is made by Rinshed-Mason and the undercoat is made by Rin -- Rinshed-Mason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.053" offset="18659558">I think they still get the primer which goes underneath both of them from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.697" offset="18678157">And as far as that black on the engine is concerned, that comes from the Acme Paint &amp; Varnish Company."</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.574" offset="18701667">And then the customer says, "Alright, that's enough for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.321" offset="18716609">I don't care what the car cost, I don't care what it looks like, I don't care how many miles you get the gallon of gas or what kind of an engine it has, I'm finish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.406" offset="18749001">I'm going to find a car that has nothing but du Pont paint on it."</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.405" offset="18773034">I think I should leave that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.302" offset="18784632">The other argument that I make, which was again advanced, I think, this afternoon, is an argument which I think -- so that I shall not run any risk of -- of misstating it, with the Court's permission, I shall read on page 10 of their reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.934" offset="18871150">This is a separate argument on this financial interest point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.241" offset="18888286">Appellant says, "And it is wholly possible for du Pont without overt action to exert considerable pressure through its other business and financial connections."</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.935" offset="18939068">I take it that was the same argument that was being made this afternoon when appellant's counsel referred to Morgan Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.051" offset="18967594">Now, there are two comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.582" offset="18973654">I think they are very important about that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.291" offset="18988492">The motive for du Pont to do anything of that kind is, of course, a desire to increase the volume of what it sells to General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.263" offset="19028407">Now, that motive will remain even if you have complete divestiture of the legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.028" offset="19051499">So that by divesting yourself of the legal -- du Pont of the legal title, it does not remove the motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.651" offset="19082010">The other comment I should like to make is, that these connections, as to which there is no evidence in the record, but these connections would exist whether you divest it to legal title or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.457" offset="19137181">Precisely the same situation would exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.856" offset="19146794">You would have the motive, what the mystery story writers call "the opportunity".</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.097" offset="19171767">And you can't change that by divesting the legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.313" offset="19184619">So on that point, appellant's proposals are no wit nor sufficient than ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.307" offset="19208652">That comment, I think, applies also to appellant's argument that simply because of buying habits or custom or old acquaintance, the purchasing agents will keep on dealing with people from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.791" offset="19262568">I don't know whether that's true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.449" offset="19269151">I doubt whether it have a "quantship" quite that strong in the business where a cost is so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.587" offset="19297677">But assume it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.827" offset="19306663">You can't change that by divesting the legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.964" offset="19323277">Those are -- are parallels or imaginary dangerous which are not touched by appellant's proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.760" offset="19346369">In our judgment, they do not justify appellant's demand for complete divestiture of the legal type.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.945" offset="19387120">Appellant has made another argument in its brief, which it has not made this afternoon here, and for that reason I'm not -- I'm trying not to say very much about it, but I think I should mention it, and that is that even if you assume that this judgement is completely affected to prevent General Motors from favoring du Pont, it isn't effective to prevent du Pont from favoring General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.833" offset="19518673">That is an argument which turns this case upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.117" offset="19539884">The appellant prevailed in this Court before on the argument that the vice in this situation was that by reason of the stock ownership, du Pont was in a position where it could preempt the market represented by General Motors' purchasers to its own advantage and to the detriment of its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.411" offset="19632985">This other argument, as I say, is an argument that reversed its answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.241" offset="19648345">It says that the danger is not bad at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.883" offset="19658898">The danger is that du Pont, by giving favors to General Motors, will enable General Motors to gain some advantages or monopolistic position in the markets in which General Motors operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.757" offset="19726399">I should like to make these comments about that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.704" offset="19738206">In the first place, there is no adjudication in this case by this Court or by the District Court which would make it permissible in our view for the Court to grant divestiture on any such basis as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.452" offset="19789197">Certainly the fear that General -- du Pont would give General Motors some advantages, which would now allow General Motors to monopolize some market, was not a probability adjudicated by this Court in its -- on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.843" offset="19846771">The second, there are no findings, there are no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.130" offset="19859937">Such evidence, as there is, is directly contrary to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.054" offset="19879581">There is -- there are evidences -- it's for the meager evidence because this issue was never tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.365" offset="19896822">There are three instances in the record where du Pont developed an extraordinary and remarkable product which it given the General Motors on exclusive basis with no doubt has given an -- an advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.884" offset="19946872">That didn't happen in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.078" offset="19955649">Duco is the most striking one because there, General Motors asked for the exclusive right to use it and was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.581" offset="19989713">The fact is that on -- in economic terms, taking into account the amount of sales of -- to General Motors in relation to du Pont's total sales, it would not, I think, ever be du Pont's advantage to do anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.573" offset="20049690">But beyond that, I should like to leave the Court with this contention this afternoon, that the -- there is no authority precedent which would entitle appellant to obtain relief, the radical relief of divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.160" offset="20107995">On a legal theory that has never been adjudicated as to which there are no conclusions or findings which such evidence as there is, is contrary to the appellant's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.291" offset="20156583">In short, it is a theory in which the Court to accept would have to suppress what facts there are and invent other facts to supply the basis of the holding.</text>
