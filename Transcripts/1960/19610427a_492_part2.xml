            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">If the Court please, when the Board granted to Delta the authority for the new through routes and the new intermediate points, the result was that Delta was given authority to inaugurate new local service between the intermediate points which were added and any other points on their exiting lines or routes or -- or connecting routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.459" offset="245217">Thus, although the main ground was a new route from Detroit to -- to Miami, the result of the addition of these new intermediate points gave Delta a right to run local service between Chicago and Indianapolis and between Indianapolis and -- and Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.844" offset="330794">And this brought it into conflict or at least potential conflict with the local services of Piedmont and Lake Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.415" offset="377083">Now, this had been anticipated because this is -- what occurs when new routes are given.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.572" offset="393697">And so, both Piedmont and Lake Central had participated -- had intervened and participated in the proceeding in order to introduce evidence as to their local traffic and -- and the effect of the grants upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.148" offset="455973">And when the order came down granting these routes without any restriction on local service, both Piedmont and Lake Central filed motions for reconsideration asking that the Board reconsider its order and imposed restrictions to protect their local services.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.304" offset="580629">There is no statutory authority for petitions for rehearing but the Board has assumed that it had power under its general rule making power and its regulations to provide for rehearing, and this was filed in time.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.093" offset="635695">There was no -- there is no issue but -- but these were timely petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.907" offset="655026">Now, these were not the only petitions for rehearing, this is a tremendous proceeding in the first place that were 10 air carriers that had made applications for some party to new routes and there were party cities that had -- cities or counties that had intervened and a number of the local carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.474" offset="745305">As a matter of fact, the record had taken 16,000 pages and there have been eight days of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.365" offset="768815">And after the decision came down, there were 16 separate petitions for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.936" offset="795146">Everybody who haven't got what he wanted immediately file the petition with the Board for reconsideration and rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.549" offset="833599">The initial order had provided that the certificates would become effective 60 days after the date of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.724" offset="866304">The petition for reconsideration came in within the first -- as of -- provided by the rules came in within the first 30 days of that 60 days, and then there were 10 days for replies.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.897" offset="910921">This gave the Civil Aeronautics Board 20 days in which to act upon these petitions for stay or rehearing reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.856" offset="950836">With an insufficient time for them to pass finally on all these matters, but they did, two or three days before the effective date of the certifications, come down with an order, it appears at page 57 of the record, in which they passed upon the applications for stay because obviously, they had the pass upon the application for stay before the effective date or -- or deny them by not passing upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.436" offset="1057102">So, on the 28th day of November, they came down with a -- brought a long opinion passing upon these motions and denying the stays as to all but one -- in one instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.451" offset="1121155">But they said specifically in this -- in this particular order, that they were -- they had examined the -- the motions for rehearing only sufficiently to determine whether or not there were sufficient error to justify staying the application of the certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.490" offset="1193357">And they stated that it was important to get these services started in order to meet the winter season to Miami, and that therefore, they were not going to issue stays except, as I say in this one -- one particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.635" offset="1249886">But they went on and provided, and I now turn to page 79 and 80 of the record, they provided in this order that the Board would continue to consider these petitions for reconsideration and that nothing in the present order should foreclose them from full and complete considerations of pending petitions on their merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.586" offset="1341733">They particularly did not act upon the merits at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.346" offset="1364720">There was no -- there was no objection to this type of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.554" offset="1389589">The certificates became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.026" offset="1403486">Delta Air Lines started its service between Detroit and Miami, and it also instituted local service between Chicago and Indianapolis and local service between Indianapolis and Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.118" offset="1467852">And then, some five months after, the Board acted on the motions for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.163" offset="1504005">And it imposed restrictions on these local calls in order to protect the interest of the local carriers in its order provided that the original certificate should be amended so as to prevent -- what it considered unnecessary competition with these local carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.272" offset="1728449">But they didn't -- no one filed that, so far as I know and I think I'm right, no one filed any further briefs or made any further argument after the refusal of a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.656" offset="1781948">Delta objected to these modifications both on their merits but particularly on the ground that the Board had no authority to modify a certificate of public convenience and necessity once it had been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.638" offset="1861883">They asked rehearing on this and the Board denied it and they've been petitioned for review in the -- originally in the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia, but it was transferred to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.508" offset="1909426">And there, the Second Circuit agreed with Delta that the Civil Aeronautics Board had no power to modify a certificate once it had become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.279" offset="1972537">Now, on its face, it seems reasonable to assume that was -- Civil Aeronautics Board, like other administrative agencies, should be permitted to choose between granting a stay of one of its procedures or not when there's been a timely petition for reconsideration without losing its -- without losing its authority, its power to consider the -- the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.162" offset="2075982">And in fact, the court below recognized the difficulties which its decision would impose on the Board, but it felt that the statute itself was so worded as to deny the Board this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.199" offset="2140139">And it found this denial in two Sections of the Act, Sections 401 (f) and 401 (g) of -- of the present Federal Aviation Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert F. Grisard</label>
            <text syncTime="1561.838" offset="6350764">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.872" offset="6358810">I, of course, concur in what has been said by Mr. Davis on behalf of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.211" offset="6384201">And my remarks here would be rather briefs and more to do with the record in the case rather than the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.505" offset="6417429">In the Delta brief, there are brief and references to what are termed opposed to decisional change of policies by the Board which, according to Delta, lead the Board to issue its order of May 9th, I believe it was, in 1960 which imposed these restrictions upon Delta's award for the benefit of Lake Central and Piedmont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.002" offset="6503424">And before I get in to that I might say in response to the previous question of Mr. Davis that Lake Central introduced evidence to show that its traffic -- its existing traffic between Cincinnati and Indianapolis and between Indianapolis and Chicago would be subject to diversion by any award made to the trunklines in this Great Lakes-Southeast case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.374" offset="6592867">And Lake Central urged both by testimony of its policy witness by its briefs to the examiner and to the Board and on oral argument to the Board that these restrictions which ultimately were placed upon these awards by the Board should be placed there for the protection of Lake Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.922" offset="6663084">The Board in its original decision placed restrictions upon Capital, which you will find at 44 of the record, upon TWA, which is shown at page 48 of the record and -- and upon United at pages 48 and 49 of the record for the protection of Lake Central's local services markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.263" offset="6736436">One of these restrictions, the one pertaining to TWA related to the Cincinnati-Indianapolis market which is one of the two involved here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.836" offset="6770709">Lake Central's petition for reconsideration, which is in the record pages 88 to 93, specifically called the -- these restrictions to the Board's attention and showed the Board that it's failure to some of the restrict Delta's authority on the other segments was clearly inadvertent admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.866" offset="6850853">The Board thereafter took its action, which is shown at page 81 of the record, and in the opinion of Lake Central this action by the Board in its order at opinion of May 7th was entirely consistent with its previous policy as evidence by its award of September 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.961" offset="6939251">I wanted to say something about why Lake Central is interested in restricting Delta in the two markets which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.610" offset="6973837">And first of all, I might say that the Board restricted Delta in a total of 10 markets, six of whom or six of which were for the protection of Piedmont and four of which for Lake Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.994" offset="7023365">Two of the Lake Central markets so protected were prospective markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.514" offset="7041442">And in a later decision issued in August of 1960, the Board denied Lake Central's applications for those two markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.823" offset="7066624">So we're not concern with the restrictions there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.905" offset="7078954">The other two markets are Cincinnati-Chica -- Cincinnati-Indianapolis, Indianapolis-Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.729" offset="7106330">In 1958, before Delta inaugurated direct service between Chicago and Indianapolis, it carried a total of 143 passengers, both local and connecting passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.045" offset="7151574">In 1959, after it had inaugurated a direct service which originated or terminated, in other words, at a point as nearby as Evansville, it carried a total of 6220 passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.838" offset="7202774">You can see what difference the lifting of this restriction or the impositions of this restriction would make upon the traffic which Lake Central would have available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.949" offset="7243212">In the Cincinnati-Indianapolis market, in 1958, Delta carried 26 passengers.In 1959, it carried 430.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.001" offset="7291382">I believe that Mr. Davis has touched briefly upon this question of the Board reserving the right to make modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.135" offset="7323878">This was a subject of comment by Delta in its briefs at page 2, Footnote 3 and at pages 16 and 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.876" offset="7358882">It is Lake Central's contention that the language of the Board which was stated at pages 79 and 80 of the record, definitely put Delta on notice that the Board might, upon reconsideration, make some modifications in the certificate which it had granted Delta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.451" offset="7445191">The Board's language is rather specifically filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.548" offset="7453550">It says, "Nothing in the present order forecloses the Board from full and complete consideration of the pending petitions for reconsideration on their merits."</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.700" offset="7718222">The question is simply whether after Civil Aeronautics Board, by affirmative action, has deliberately made a certificate of public convenience and necessity effective on a given day.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.364" offset="8112880">As a matter of fact, the Board has at least four or five different avenues which it can take to avoid during what it did in this case and putting a carrier such as Delta in a desperate position of having invested a great sums of money following the effective date only to have portions of the certificate authority removed some five months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.775" offset="8194487">For example, specifically responding to your question, Mr. Justice Brennan, one thing that the Board normally does is, Justice Stewart indicated, is to allow itself a 60-day period which gives 20 days for petitions for reconsideration to be filed, 10 days for answer and 30 days for action by the Board before the certificate becomes effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.000" offset="8283408">In complex cases such as the Southern Transcontinental case, I mentioned a moment ago, it allows itself 90 days so that there will be again 20 days for petitions for reconsideration, 10 days for answers but 60 days for action by the Board after all pleadings have been filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.083" offset="13183666">The Board has never approached this thing in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.678" offset="13194115">It has never used the temporary certificate as a device to solve this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.535" offset="13213550">But it does have a long and extended history of how it has handled it in the past which is consistent with what I am arguing for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.573" offset="13245628">Now, let me just point this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.275" offset="13256495">This thing all began back in 1948 when the Civil Aeronautics Board had a very similar case to the one presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.393" offset="13296933">It had put out a certificate authorizing new service to be operated between Kansas City and Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.526" offset="13325458">A certificate had become fully effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.215" offset="13340191">Service was about to be inaugurated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.557" offset="13349595">Just after the certificate had become effective by a few days, the Board issued an order in which it indicated that it was going to consider taking that certificate away or modifying or either withdrawing it, giving it to somebody else or modifying what had been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.878" offset="13418872">The Board's power to do this was very seriously contested in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.869" offset="13438830">We refer, at page 29 of our brief to the Court, to this case where the Board didn't rule squarely on the problem because it reaffirmed the original certificate and therefore mooted the legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.924" offset="13495045">But as you'll see in the quotation at the -- just above the footnote on page 29, the Board said, "We have grave out however as to our possession of such power."</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.321" offset="13536632">And then turning over to the top of the next page, in view of this doubt, the Board made this policy announcement, "In future cases of this kind, except for national security or other urgent considerations dictate otherwise, we shall pursue a policy of making the certificate effective on such date, as we'll permit reconsideration without creating the legal problem raised in the present case."</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="3381.371" offset="13628897">Doesn't that -- this present situation come within the reservation of other urgent situation?</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.715" offset="13690232">Now, they have always, with the exception of this case, and one other which was not contested, they have always set that effective date far enough out in the future, so that they could deal with these petitions for reconsiderations before the certificate became effective and the carrier got out on a limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.333" offset="13764733">Now, it's not only that the Board has consistently followed this practice itself, it is so represented to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.746" offset="13794408">For example, in the case known as the Southwest Airways versus the Civil Aeronautics Board, which we referred to on page 31 of our brief, in briefing the case to the Ninth Circuit, the Board said this, "These clauses were providing for a future effective date for the certificate were inserted therein for the stated purpose of giving the parties to the proceeding an opportunity to file petitions for reconsideration of the Board a supplemental decision and to ensure time for the Board to act their own prior to the effective date of the certificate."</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.453" offset="13933171">Continuing, "The language therein requiring that a certificate shall continue in effect until suspended or revoked as hereinafter provided comes into play only from the date specified for effectiveness in the certificate."</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.947" offset="13987192">And the Ninth Circuit relied very heavily on this representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.453" offset="14001194">And in the next quotation on page 32, we see what the Ninth Circuit said, skipping the introductory language, "The Board points to its administrative practice of postponing certificates of this character, so that time may be allowed for petition for reconsideration of apparent orders."</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.095" offset="14071724">The Circuit then referred to the Board's Kansas City-Memphis case and continued to say, "The Board certainly has the power to reconsider its orders and set them aside and if certificate's not yet effective or dependent on those orders, they will be extinguished."</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.557" offset="14129612">The situation is totally different from that in which a certificate has become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.762" offset="14150405">Now, not only in its administrative practice, not only in its representations to the federal courts, but also on its own rules or practice, the Board has focused directly on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.730" offset="14198262">Let me point out to you, if I may, in Delta's brief to this Court, the very last page of the brief appendix -- page 3 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.188" offset="14232116">The Board's rule of practice dealing with filing petitions for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.632" offset="14253850">The second full sentence says, "However, neither the filing nor the granting of such a petition shall operate as a stay of such final order unless specifically so ordered by the Board."</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.632" offset="14317902">In other words, in its own rule of practice, the Board recognized that this petition for reconsideration doesn't stay the effective date of that certificate going out, unless it takes affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.477" offset="14361266">Now, one other point on this same subject, there was a footnote in the Government's brief which referred to an amendment of these rules governing reconsideration and the footnote said the rule was amended on February 14, 1959 in respects not here relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.644" offset="14445902">Well, I would respectfully submit that that amendment in February of 1959 is extremely irrelevant, and I would like to call your attention to just what the Board did in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.553" offset="14501595">On page 31 of our brief, we call the Court's attention to what the Board said when it amended the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.043" offset="14531584">Now, let me tell you first before I refer to the language, what the amendment was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.246" offset="14548407">As we have said before, customarily, the Board allowed itself about 30 days to act on these petitions for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.866" offset="14578813">It used to be that they allowed 30 days for filing of the petition and 10 days for answer and that cut into their normal 60-day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.798" offset="14614549">So in February of 1959, they amended this rule so as to require petitions to be filled in 20 days, answers in 10 and this increased their time for action from 20 days to 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.124" offset="14663868">And they said this -- gave this as their reason for taking this action giving themselves longer time.It is the Board's normal practice in route proceedings to make certificate awards effective 60 days after issuance of the final opinion and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.489" offset="14721337">Thus, under present filing procedures, they are normally remains only a 20-day period between the completion of filings in the date upon which the certificate becomes effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.329" offset="14760730">It has become increasingly evident, particularly with the growing size and complexity of the Board's route proceedings that a period of 20 days is wholly inadequate and imposes an undo burden upon the Board and its staff when some action by the Board is necessary or desirable before new or amended certificates take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.559" offset="14845576">So I say, gentlemen, that we have a consistent administrative interpretation of this statute recognizing the point for which I contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.255" offset="14888417">That in the face of this administrative interpretation, the statue has been -- been reenacted with identical language by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.272" offset="14920495">And I think we have plenty of good case brought to the effect that this constitutes absence some peculiar circumstances endorsement of the administrative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.075" offset="14959679">We have the Board's rules of practice which are recognized since they were originally passed back in the late 1930s, that they had to take some actions staying the effective date of the certificate if they wanted to have effective control of petitions for reconsideration after the effective date originally set forth for the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.635" offset="15037942">They have told the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal that this is what they do and the Court has blessed that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.439" offset="15065109">So, what the Second Circuit below is doing was not bringing in some novel interpretation which flies in the face of the Board's established practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.096" offset="15099800">But as said, gentlemen, you have a way of dealing with this situation which gives you complete and continuing control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.580" offset="15125713">But don't let that certificate become effective if you want to keep control, because when it becomes effective, you authorize the airline to go out and spend literally, gentlemen, millions of dollars in equipping itself in inaugurating service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.338" offset="15180675">And we are not going to let you sit on petitions for reconsideration for five or six months after the certificate becomes effective, and you can encourage the inauguration of service and then say that you reserve some power to take it away.</text>

            <text syncTime="3900.076" offset="15703646">Well, now, let me just point out to you the ultimate logic of the Government's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.477" offset="15729246">As I told you before, the petitions for reconsideration which were filed involved not just these 10 pairs of points here at issue, but they involved attempts to over throw all of the Great Lakes area-Florida routes, which had been certificated by that same original order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.934" offset="15799150">In other words, attempts were made to take away Northwest authority from Chicago to Florida and Delta's from Detroit to Florida, and Capital's from Pittsburgh to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.732" offset="15838333">That the order came out in September, petitions for reconsideration were filed 30 days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.720" offset="15858291">Specific request for stay of all of these major important routes were filed with the Board, and the Board came out with this opinion and said, "We have looked it over, we find no probable error, we haven't had time yet to get the opinion out, but we are not going to stay these things, and what's more, we urge you to get started."</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.735" offset="15930284">Now, sir, let me just ask you to consider yourself in the position of airline management based with language of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.701" offset="15962154">I'm reading now from pages 58 to 59 of the record, which is this order that the Board put out in -- in the latter part of November.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.387" offset="16008965">Because of the detailed matter as raised in the petitions for reconsideration, it will not be possible to finally dispose of them until after November 29th, the effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.408" offset="16048985">Accordingly, we are acting on the request for stay in this opinion in order, an order disposing of the petitions for reconsideration in full will be issued on a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.089" offset="16087751">In assessing the request for stay, we have, of course, given consideration of the petitions for reconsideration to determine the likelihood of error in our original decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.678" offset="16126098">After reviewing the matters raised in such petitions, we conclude that except a specifically noted hereinafter with respect to Eastern certificate, the parties have not made a sufficient showing of probable legal error or abuse of discretion in our decision so as to warrant for the stay be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.282" offset="16196524">Moreover, in this proceeding, we have found that new services to Florida are immediately required by the public convenience and necessity during the 1958-1959 season.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.550" offset="16237589">We are of the opinion that these services should be put into operation at the advent of peak winter season in order to give the travelling public the full advantage thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.882" offset="16274892">Now, Northwest, Delta, Capital took this at its face value, relying on how the Board had treated effective date in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.886" offset="16314911">We went out and we got the equipment and the personnel, and we set-up the stations not just to serve these 10 pairs of points in the Great Lakes area, but to set up these extended routes with multi-million dollar equipment running from the Great Lakes area to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.629" offset="16373844">Now, my point, gentlemen, is this, the same order which denied the petitions for reconsideration with respect to those major routes involving millions of dollars of equipment was the same order which took this operating authority in these 10 markets away from Delta.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.214" offset="16440195">Now, the practical effect of adopting the Government's position is to say that despite this long administrative and judicial background, despite the Boards having denied stay of the effective date, despite the Board having said, "Get out there and get the service in operation because we've got to have it for these people this winter," that five or six months later, in the same order which took away our authorization in these 10 pairs, they could have said, "We're going to act on those petitions for reconsideration despite the effective date of the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.278" offset="16556492">And we're going to withdraw all of three of those Florida authorizations," and then, where would we have been?</text>

            <text syncTime="4414.775" offset="17762513">In response to a question about whether all of the administrative agencies -- whether administrative agencies generally were given power for -- to rehear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.125" offset="17807862">The Solicitor General has called my attention that there is no specific power for rehearing in the statutes dealing with the National Labor Relations Board and probably not with respect to the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.946" offset="17859166">And as I recollected, there is no such provision neither with respect to Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.174" offset="17880064">So, I would -- I would "hazardly" guessed that there was a period in the early 1930s when there was a series of this -- some of these statutes, because Federal Trade Commission goes earlier than that when they didn't make any provision for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.053" offset="17939623">On the other hand, with respect to the Federal Power Commission, there's not only a provision a rehearing, but there is a requirement that they petitioned for rehearing because they could seek judicial review so that not only do they authorized the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.905" offset="18007019">Mr. Maurer pointed out that one circumstance under which effective certificates would be modified would be in a situation where there was a -- application for review to a court, and a court in reviewing the order found that it was defective in some way and ordered a change.</text>

            <text syncTime="4502.338" offset="18112763">Let us assume that Lake Central and Piedmont came to the -- to the Civil Aeronautics Board and convinced them that their order was wrong after -- after it become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.667" offset="18170023">Does this mean that they would have to say, "We're sorry, we can do nothing about it, you have to go to court to get an order for us to do something about it, but if you do go to a court and get an order, then we can do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.275" offset="18212446">In other words, what Mr. Maurer is saying that the Board cannot do it voluntarily, but it can do it by -- when -- when it's been litigated and ordered to do so and this -- this just doesn't make any sense.</text>
