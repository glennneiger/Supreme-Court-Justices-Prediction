            <text syncTime="11.037" offset="147519">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.125" offset="163924">This is a denaturalization case, which is here on certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.806" offset="194644">The petitioner, Peter Chaunt, was born in Hungary and he came to this country in 1921, when he was 22 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.514" offset="237380">On June 27, 1940, he filed a formal petition for naturalization in the eastern district of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.284" offset="280534">And on that date, he was interviewed by examiners for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.149" offset="311986">They passed him and recommended his naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.540" offset="329540">And on November 28, 1940, the eastern district admitted him to citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.977" offset="359320">I think it is of some relevance that he was admitted to citizenship under the Nationality Act of 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.871" offset="398817">The 1940 Nationality Act, which superseded the 1906 Act had already been passed, but was in effect until sometime in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.353" offset="448763">Anyway, on November 28, 1940, he became a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.687" offset="470079">Thirteen years later, the Government brought a denaturalization suit in California under Section 340(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act alleging that he had procured naturalization by concealment and misrepresentation and asking for a judgment cancelling his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.838" offset="582719">The complaint alleged concealments and misrepresentation on three subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.405" offset="616991">And the first subject was on an arrest record.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.939" offset="639143">Briefly, the complaint alleged that the in the naturalization proceedings, Chaunt has been asked if he had ever been arrested and he said he had not been arrested and in fact he had a record of several arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.321" offset="688671">I will at a subsequent point in detail what those arrests were.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.220" offset="708211">And the second ground was that he had concealed Communist Party membership that having been asked whether in effect whether he was a member of the Communist Party, he had denied it and this denial was untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.893" offset="758993">And the third ground, I would lump together in one alleged that he had misrepresented his attachment to the Constitution disposition to the good order and happiness of the United States and he has intend to owe allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.025" offset="811447">And those three allegations as to his -- what you might call as political state of mind when I refer -- if I referred to him again, I will call them the attachment ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.835" offset="870693">But those were the three subjects of misrepresentation alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.664" offset="890023">Arrest, Communist Party membership and attachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.523" offset="2677426">I would like now to argue my first point which as basically already been stated by Justice Frankfurter, and that is that the natural -- the judgment of the court below, he stand because it was based on a misrepresentation or concealment, which is not alluded to in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.663" offset="2790066">Now in the Zucca case, the Court said that the filing of this affidavit of good cause is a prerequisite through filing and maintaining a denaturalization action, and it has to be filed with the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.134" offset="2863940">And the year or two after Zucca and that was a companion cases, the Court said that this prerequisite what it said in the statute and was so important that you couldn't cure the failure to file an affidavit upon -- with the complaint by amendment, and you couldn't have a late filing and an amendment of the complaint so as to make a valid denaturalization action or a valid denaturalization judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.731" offset="3002284">Now, here we have an affidavit, but so far as the ground of denaturalization is concerned and as the case is now before us, the ground of denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.971" offset="3055261">The ground on which petitioner was denaturalized is the one ground on which the Court of Appeals had.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.083" offset="3083682">Insofar as the ground for denaturalization is concerned therefore, we have no affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.142" offset="3119940">Now we do have an affidavit on other grounds, but not an affidavit on the ground on which denaturalization was a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.648" offset="3149928">And that seems to me to be the same as having no affidavit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.493" offset="3169364">And the matter was virtually anticipated by a sentence in the Court's opinion written by Mr. Justice Harlan in the Nowak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.532" offset="3213458">And in the Nowak case, the -- one of the issues was whether or not the affidavit of good cause was sufficient, because it wasn't based on personal knowledge, but based on matters seen in the files and records of the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.090" offset="3291721">And the Court held that that affidavit, even though not based on personal knowledge was sufficient because it said, it fulfilled the general purpose of the affidavit requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.321" offset="3344697">And in setting out what these purposes were and how it fulfilled it, the Court's opinion in Nowak said, and I think this was the first thing it said on the subject "In substance, the affidavit set forth the same matters upon which the District Court's later decree of denaturalization was based."</text>
            <text syncTime="832.905" offset="3434977">Now then it went on and mentioned other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.471" offset="3445217">But the first thing to which the opinion called attention to was that the affidavit matched the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.532" offset="3981458">And the purpose was stated in the Zucca case.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.525" offset="3997445">It said the purpose of the affidavit is to protect the individual that is denaturalized citizen, so that he shall not feel obliged to defend his citizenship and to defend his reputation unless at least the Government first has this probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.203" offset="4108204">In other words, it's a matter of reputation because in Zucca, the Court pointed out that mere -- even the allegation can damage the citizen so that Congress intended that the allegations shouldn't be made without having this showing of just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.396" offset="4180929">And the situation you have here is that the petitioner here had its reputation damaged with respect to concealment of arrest, and he have to defend his citizenship with respect to alleged falsification of arrest without this safeguard of the affidavit that the Court in Zucca said was a prerequisite and the purpose of which was to protect the citizen from even having to defend his citizenship and his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.660" offset="4342053">Now the Government says, well after all, he was already suffering because the other two causes of action are sustained by the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.929" offset="4399104">Now that's like saying that if the Government has a right to give a man one black eye, he has a right to give him two black eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.580" offset="4433690">Now because they have a right to do something which injures -- injures the reputation in one respect, that doesn't mean that they have a right to tear away every last strip of his reputation, and because the affidavit gave him a right to make this man defend his reputation insofar as something about communism was concerned that doesn't mean that he had no reputation left and therefore they had a right to put him to the test of defending his reputation and a citizenship so far as falsification of arrest are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.370" offset="4580812">And if the Government is right, what they could in this case have alleged only arrest in the affidavit and confine the litigation entirely to the matters of communism even though they weren't mentioned in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.421" offset="4653014">And certainly, that would be under the present environment of very serious blow to his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.452" offset="4685197">And yet, if the Government is right, the safeguard of the affidavit would not be required on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.892" offset="4714977">Or if the Government is right, they can file an arrest on subject A, let us say concealment of arrest, let us say concealment of the number of years in this country and then they go to trial, they don't even litigate the subject in the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.172" offset="4776103">They litigate all kinds of other subjects, some of which maybe very damaging to the man's reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.261" offset="4808391">So it is my position that if you are to give the affidavit, the function which it was intended and are to serve its purpose, then you have to confine the litigation to the ground in the litigation as the Court's opinion in Nowak recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.519" offset="4881429">And now I want to come to the next point of my argument which maybe described as the materiality point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.860" offset="4922807">Now the petitioner here in the denaturalization proceeding did say that he had never been arrested and as to this, there's no problem because on one of the forms, he answered “No” when he was asked that he's never been arrested or charged of violation of any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.469" offset="5005249">And there's no question but that the evidence demonstrates that in fact, he's been arrested three times all in New Haven, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.700" offset="5050180">In all three arrests occurring, 10 to 11 years prior to his-- the time he filed his application of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.329" offset="5096678">And I'd like to tell you what these arrests were because the factual situation becomes crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.543" offset="5125517">The first arrest was on July 30th, 1929 and this arrest was on a charge that the petitioner had violated a New Haven City Ordinance by distributing handbills on the public street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.301" offset="5200541">The petitioner pleaded not guilty and he was discharged and that's the first arrest in this disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.504" offset="5233351">Incidentally, the text to the ordinance, under which this -- he was arrested in which the warrant was issued, appears on the record at pages 69 and 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.070" offset="5279640">The Court of Appeals was mistaken when they make the observation of their opinion that the text of this and the second ordinance was not before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.504" offset="5317360">In fact, the text of the two ordinances because this one would be -- what I'll mention next were introduced as government exhibit without any opposition or objection by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.663" offset="5366053">So as I say that was the first arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.860" offset="5378800">Needless to say, I think it's quite obvious you look at the ordinance and look at the charge by the way that in the light of Jamison against Texas subsequent cases, this New Haven ordinance was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.106" offset="5439822">The second arrest occurred on December 21st, 1929.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="1346.604" offset="5489768">I don't think it's particularly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.279" offset="5504502">I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.591" offset="5521742">But for whatever bearing it has, the ordinance was plainly a violation of the First Amendment at least with the hindsight of the Supreme Court decision to decide it afterward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.090" offset="5571688">On December 21st, 1929 which was also more than 10 years before the petitioner applied for his naturalization, he was arrested on the charge that he had violated the New Haven park regulations by making, and I'd better quote this, “an oration, harangue, or other public demonstration in New Haven Green, outside of the churches.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.241" offset="5700315">The -- this -- he pleaded not guilty to this offense and the disposition is unclear in the record as everybody admits including the Court of Appeal and so I don't know whether he was convicted or not convicted or acquitted or what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.362" offset="5772831">I don't think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.087" offset="5779728">I would mention that the maximum fine under this ordinance, in fact, the only penalty under the ordinance was applied now with fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.263" offset="5816404">And I might say it's also clear that this ordinance was unconstitutional because it said that nobody should be allowed to make an oration, harangue, or other public demonstration in the Green and outside of the churches that is, unless he got special authority the Commissioner has gave no standards for the Commission to exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.912" offset="5891009">So under Crook (ph) against New York, decided some years later, that was under unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.855" offset="5914833">The third arrest also occurred more than 10 years before the application and that occurred on March 11, 1930 and that arrest was on a complaint issued by the New Haven City Attorney which charged that the petitioner committed general breach of the peace and that's all it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.492" offset="6009292">It didn't say wherein he committed a general breach of the peace and I suppose one might claim that it wasn't sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.013" offset="6051401">They definitely state any kind of cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.954" offset="6067179">Anyway, the petitioner here pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.112" offset="6087868">First, he filed the demurrer which was overruled by Whittaker, Jay but he was convicted after that demurrer was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.167" offset="6124022">He was convicted by the city court and was found to -- found guilty and fined $25 and he appealed that to the county court which made it a -- a trial de novo and on appeal the case was null so that the ultimate disposition of that case was also -- no conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.947" offset="6239169">So those are the three arrests, 10 or to 11 years of prior to the application of citizenship, all of them of the utmost trivial charges nothing involving the moral turpitude or anything like that, none of it resulting in convictions with the possible exception of the one in which he might have been fined $5 and that two of them on obviously unconstitutional orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.917" offset="6367065">And the question arises whether concealment of this tribute justifies denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.548" offset="6405517">Now, the Government recognizes that a -- and admits that you can only denaturalize for a material concealment or misrepresentation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="1609.940" offset="6543130">And I didn't raise that in my petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.892" offset="6562983">As far as I'm concerned, I don't -- my argument applies no matter what is bad faith was.I accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.215" offset="6596211">I mean I'm just not -- I'm not claiming that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.101" offset="6619826">Now the Government says you'll have to suppress a material of fact or not only of material concealment or misrepresentation to justify denaturalization and then they start examining and analyzing the meaning of the word material in the light of case law and judicial definitions and public policy and whatever are the considerations that the courts has taken to account in determining what a concept or a word means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.940" offset="6767156">And they end up that -- frankly, I don't know what they think material mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.292" offset="6788577">My approach is entirely different because I say it isn't a question of the case law or definition of the word material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.688" offset="6826088">I say that if you must use it, the technique -- the issue in terms of materiality which maybe a little misleading, I say that the statute has a built-in definition of materiality and this is my approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.767" offset="6894425">If you look at these statutes, it doesn't authorize denaturalization on account of any concealment or misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.519" offset="6945416">It only authorizes denaturalization in cases where the naturalization was procured by concealment or misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.450" offset="7001213">So under the statute, the test of materiality is, did the falsification or suppression procure the naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.443" offset="7041128">If it didn't procure the naturalization then it doesn't make any difference how material it maybe in terms of case law in other field, it has nothing to do with the statute and it doesn't authorize denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.874" offset="7106853">And when you say that the falsification or suppression must have procured denaturalization, what you are saying is that the test of materiality is -- did the falsification make the difference between getting denaturalization and not getting denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.232" offset="7184280">If it wouldn't have made difference, if the true facts had been revealed then obviously the suppression of the true facts did not procure the naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.178" offset="7240077">So how do you apply this test that I'm saying, the test of did the falsification procure the naturalization?</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.052" offset="7275604">The first thing you have to do is to look at what where the conditions for naturalization at the time of naturalization?</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.129" offset="7307891">In this case, you would look at the 1906 Act and see what the requirements and conditions were for naturalization and then you have to ask yourself two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.046" offset="7351568">First, would the facts which were suppressed have in themselves justify the naturalizing court in denying naturalization?</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.382" offset="7404857">If they did, then obviously by suppressing those facts, the applicant for naturalization procured naturalization by this fraud and you can end the inquiry there, and an example would be where if the naturalization statue require five years residence and the applicant said, “Well, I've lived here five years”, in fact, he'd only lived there four, obviously, that falsification procured denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.146" offset="7531917">But you don't stop there because -- let's assume a situation like here for instance where the facts which were suppressed would not in themselves have justify denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.613" offset="7597850">Nevertheless, the suppression might have procured denaturalization if the true facts had they been disclosed, would have led to discovery of other facts which would have resulted in just or which would have justified the naturalizing court in denying the naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.783" offset="7694503">Thank you.</text>
