            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Forer, you may proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="2.537" stopTime="964.518">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="2.537" offset="113560">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.414" offset="125053">I was saying at the recess that in order to meet the statutory requirement, that a suppression had procured denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.867" offset="166849">It follows as logically and inevitably that you have to show one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.023" offset="199450">Either that the true facts, if disclosed, within themselves have justified the naturalizing court in denying naturalization under the then applicable standards of naturalization or two, that the true facts, if disclosed, would have led to the discovery of other facts, which if known, would have justified the naturalizing court in denying naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.581" offset="321703">Now, if I'm right and this becomes a crucial issue, then you can't say that a person shall be denaturalized because the suppressed facts, which if disclosed, might have or would have led to an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.149" offset="399966">Because if I am right, you'll also have to then go on and show that the investigation would have discovered facts which would have justify denaturalization or which you have justified a refusal of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.073" offset="463705">If the investigation would have been fruitless, in the sense that it would not have discovered anything to the man's discredit or would not have discovered anything that would have justified denial of naturalization, then the investigation has nothing to do with whether he got naturalization or didn't get naturalization, it therefore has no bearing on whether or not denaturalization was procured by the misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.620" offset="581883">And I -- I think if we will see, that is the principal issue between my position and the opposition of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.586" offset="617723">And I think my position follows, not only from the language of the statute which says that you can denaturalize only if naturalization was procured by the suppression, but it also follows from the principle which this Court has repeatedly announced, which is in substance that in a denaturalization case, the defendant, denaturalized citizen is given every possible benefit, both on the facts and on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.592" offset="753768">And I think that's particularly important, in view of the fact that there seems to be no statute of limitations and no rule of laches so as to prevent the Government from bringing stale cases many years after naturalization was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.184" offset="828061">Now, I think it is apparent that if my test of materiality, which I think is the statutory test, is applied to this case, then the -- the judgment below was wrong in holding that the petitioner was rightly denaturalized on the arrest ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.785" offset="914474">If you'll look at the statute which set the rules at the time of naturalization, namely the 1906 Naturalization Act, there was only one ground which had any possible relevance to the subject of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.468" offset="989288">And that was the requirement of the statute that before an alien could be naturalized, he had to be -- be a person who had behaved for the five preceding years as a person of -- of good moral character and attached to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.422" offset="1065044">Now, it is perfectly clear that if you use the first branch of my test, that if these arrests had been disclosed, they would not have justified the naturalizing court in holding that the then alien did not meet the requirement of five years good character.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.465" offset="1153233">First of all, the arrests were remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.194" offset="1160129">They were 10 years before the petition not within the five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.214" offset="1180191">Secondly, they had no application to a man's character anyway, since they were for trivial offenses, did not result in convictions and at least two of them were -- were unconstitutional offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.358" offset="1236825">And the Court of Appeals did not claim and did not hold that the arrest, if they had been divulged, would have justified the denial of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.882" offset="1278934">So, I think we can -- I can get safely pass the first prong of my test of materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.739" offset="1310281">This leads to the next -- the next branch of my test, and that is, did the suppression of the arrest result in suppressing facts, which if known or if discovered, would have other facts, which if discovered, would have justified the denial of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.576" offset="1413726">Now, in the first place, the Court of Appeals didn't claim that that was the situation either.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.872" offset="1442879">The Court of Appeals said, in their opinion and it's perfectly clear, and this is at pages 95 and 96 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.199" offset="1472136">The Court of Appeals said the only thing that mattered was that the falsification blocked an investigation and it didn't make any difference, what the investigation would have discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.002" offset="1535352">And it didn't make any difference that if the investigation had been held, nevertheless, naturalization might have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.974" offset="1579238">Now, for the reasons I've already gone into, that seems to be clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.352" offset="1612779">So, let's come now to a -- to apply the correct test, which is, would the investigation have disclosed a disqualifying factor to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.655" offset="1661994">The only testimony in the record on this subject was offered by the Government's witness, the hearing examiner, the -- for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a man by the name of Derringer, and I quote this testimony in full, beginning at the bottom of page 17 and running on to page 18 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.831" offset="1766693">And Derringer testified that if a person had an arrest record, an investigation would follow but he testified that the only thing the investigation would do, would be to verify the facts concerning the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.505" offset="1845373">And that's what he said, would be just to check whether or not the listing of arrest, for instance, had been accurate and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.642" offset="1885915">So, if you take Derringer's testimony, if the petitioner had disclosed his arrest record or if you take Derringer's testimony, the only thing an investigation would have disclosed is the identicals matter concerning the arrest that we know now and then it's now in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.004" offset="1971388">And as I've already said, obviously, those trivia in themselves would have not had justified refusal of naturalization and the court below recognize that they would not have justified refusal of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.665" offset="2034082">So on Derringer's testimony and that is the only testimony there is in the record, there is nothing to -- Derringer's testimony negatized and there's no other testimony for the contrary, any assumption that an investigation would have discovered any disqualifying fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.125" offset="2119868">And when you consider that the Government has the burden in a denaturalization case, approving all essential parts of each case by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence which does not lead the issue in doubt, then it is perfectly clear that if the Government, as I say it had, had the burden of showing that there was a dena -- disqualifying fact in the background, which an investigation would have led to, then the Government has not carried that burden because the only testimony in the record is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.664" offset="2273991">Now, the Government, in its brief, now subs -- tries to substitute a complete speculation for proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.569" offset="2313697">They say that at the time of these arrests, 1929 and 1930, they say that the record shows that at or about that time, the petitioner was a district organizer for the Communist Party in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.042" offset="2387571">And they say, well, it seems we -- it seems likely or it can be assumed that if the Service have had the information about the arrest, it would have investigated the arrest and presumably the arrest would might have had something to do with his activities as an official of the Communist Party, and then the Service would have discovered from the arrest that he was therefore a -- had been a district organizer for the Communist Party and this might have led to a denial of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.004" offset="2523408">Now, there are about four things wrong with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.513" offset="2541380">The first argument is that it is a complete speculation, which can't possibly meet the test for denaturalization, which has been repeatedly announced by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.890" offset="2594983">It not only has no evidence to support it, it is a speculation and direct contradiction to the testimony of Derringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.488" offset="2625285">In the second place, there is no competent evidence in this record, that at the period of the arrest, the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party or was a district organizer in -- for the Communist Party in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.655" offset="2682023">There is incompetent evidence on that subject in the record, consisting of some hearsay testimony by John Lautner, the Government's perennial witness and of some articles in the Daily Worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.396" offset="2736985">But I don't even -- but I don't think that's the important fact because even if you accepted the hearsay testimony as establishing membership in the Communist Party at this period, nevertheless, there is nothing in record to show that the arrest had anything to do with the Communist Party or that the investigation of the arrest would've led to anything to that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.517" offset="2841475">And I may also say that, as a matter of fact, membership in the Communist Party at that time would've been irrelevant anyway for a large number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.158" offset="2875956">One reason is that it was 10 years before the petition for application and not within the five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.926" offset="2907094">The other reason is, and under the 1906 Act, that Communists were not barred from naturalization nor for that matter were persons belonging to organizations advocating the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.351" offset="2964773">And Schneiderman, for example, was naturalized under the 1906 Act and this Court held in the Schneiderman case that -- that didn't seem to be anything wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.411" offset="3029034">Now, in my original brief, I said nothing about or made no argument about the two grounds of denaturalization other than the arrest ground, namely the -- what I've called the "Communist Party ground" and what I've called the "attachment ground."</text>
            <text syncTime="753.221" offset="3116283">And the reason I didn't argue those two grounds was because the Court of Appeals hadn't discussed them and said that it didn't have to consider them.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.969" offset="3155257">And I assume as I said in the footnote in my brief, that under those circumstances, if this Court thought that I was right on either of my -- either of the points that I raised so that the judgment was wrong, so far as the arrests were concerned, that the Court would follow the normal practice of remanding the case to the Court of Appeals to dispose off and decide the remaining issues, namely, the Communist and attachment ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.398" offset="3284929">In its brief, the Government alleged as an independent ground for sustaining the judgment below, that there had been a misrepresentation as to membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.501" offset="3361416">The Government didn't allege what I call the "third ground" as an independent ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.793" offset="3382523">They didn't talk about the "attachment ground" but they urged the Court to affirm the judgment below even if the court below is wrong on the arrest, on the grounds that there had been a misrepresentation as the Communist Party membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.273" offset="3452426">And the assumption in the Government's brief is, that it -- the Court ought to do this even though it's an exception to its usual remand practice because there isn't any factual issue or no real dispute on the facts and it's just the question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.373" offset="3520867">So in my reply brief, I took up this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.141" offset="3543960">Now, as far as I'm concerned, this issue has to be decided and it's up to the Court whether the Court wants to decide it or whether it wants to send it back to the Court of Appeals to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.466" offset="3585233">That is it has to be decided if -- if I am right on either of my first big point.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.762" offset="3606444">And I wouldn't presume to tell the Court whether it should decide it or whether it shouldn't waste its time and let the Court of Appeals decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.237" offset="3636328">But since the issue was raised in my reply brief, I did analyze the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.521" offset="3657435">I analyzed the facts and I think I showed that there -- not only is there a factual question but that the only correct resolution of the factual question is that the petitioner did not, did not lie on the subject of Communist Party membership, or that the Government did not prove that there had been any misrepresentation or suppression on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.160" offset="3772061">This depends on -- on rather complicated and involved state of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.696" offset="3802154">In addition to that, I went on and said that the subject was not -- was not a material subject within my definition in any event under the 1906 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.782" offset="3850533">Now, for present purposes, since I don't know whether the Government still adheres for its position, that there basically is no factual dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.814" offset="3890657">I would like to, unless the Court appeals otherwise, reserve any possible discussion on the suppression as to or alleged suppression as to Communist Party membership until after the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.478" offset="3949275">And for that reason, I will reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Maurice A. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="970.369" offset="3984802">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.445" offset="4005177">Perhaps at the outset, I should clarify the Government's position with respect to the question which counsel for petitioner just raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.088" offset="4043734">When we filed our brief in this Court, we had supposed that the fact findings below with respect to the petitioner's membership in the Communist Party at the time of his naturalization were not questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.555" offset="4109563">For the reasons that we stated in our brief on the merits, we felt that there was no dispute as to the evidence and we feel we were justified in taking that position but it seems now that we were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.550" offset="4165569">Petitioner does dispute the evidence underlying the District Court's fact findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.749" offset="4194408">Under the circumstances, we feel we cannot ask this Court to decide these factual questions on a very large record without the sifting process in the Ninth Circuit, and without having that particular issue briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.454" offset="4269223">I might point out that the adequacy of the evidence in this regard, was not raised, or briefed, or argued in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.615" offset="4309870">And it is for that reason that we assumed that there was solely a question of law with respect to the Communist Party concealment which this Court could determine and could affirm on the basis of the facts found below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.810" offset="4374653">Now, turning to the specific issues, I'd like to add one further word though.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.159" offset="8440038">Oh I think -- I think that -- that the questions asked should be relevant to his eligibility for naturalization and there are various eligibility requirements, good moral character and attachments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.215" offset="8492283">And as I propose to develop in the course of my argument, those are ultimate facts which must be found but they depend in the final analysis on developing subsidiary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.606" offset="8541811">For example, I don't suppose it can be expected that the requirement of good moral character would be established merely by asking the petitioner, "Are you a person of good moral character?</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.226" offset="8600325">Or are you attached to the principles of the Constitution?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.672" offset="8614013">and accepting his affirmative response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.748" offset="8626343">The whole history of the nationality laws and their development indicates that when naturalization was an ex parte proceeding in the courts before the Nationality Act of 1960 -- 1906, so many frauds were perpetrated that as a result of a presidential commission's findings, the 1906 Act was enacted with specific provisions requiring a naturalization examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.846" offset="8766777">The -- the underlying facts are well-developed in this Court's opinion in the (Inaudible) case and so I won't go into the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.208" offset="8796244">But in the 1906 Act, Congress set up two safeguards against fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.028" offset="8823515">First of all, it set up a Bureau of Naturalization to administer the Act and it authorized naturalization examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.894" offset="8862908">This was Section 11 of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.272" offset="8872417">It authorized naturalization examiners to appear in court representing the Government and to question the petitioners and to present evidence with respect to the qualifications for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.191" offset="8928110">That is the first time that this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.071" offset="8943679">And then Section 15 of the 1906 Act had another safeguard against fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.842" offset="8966771">It set up the ancestor of the present provision authorizing judicial revocation of naturalization which had been fraudulently or illegally obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.372" offset="9012851">In fact, this Court pointed out at an early case, I believe it was the Nest case that the naturalization examiners were the ones who, by reason of their expertise, could best be relied upon for determining the qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.237" offset="9100309">But in the final analysis, the qualifications for naturalization must depend on the good faith of the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.132" offset="9291943">Then the second question is whether the concealment of the arrest was material to this petitioner's naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.599" offset="9329768">We have suggested a third point which this Court may wish to consider in the event there is a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.187" offset="9360071">That is if we are incorrect in our first two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.399" offset="9376998">And that is the question which petitioner has raised in his replied brief and which we have discussed somewhat in our brief on the merits as to whether the concealment of Communist Party membership, even if adequately proved, was a material fact under the statute, the 1940 when petitioner was naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.081" offset="9479711">At a later point in my argument, I hope to discuss that if time will permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.449" offset="9501132">We feel that that is an issue which this Court might wish to determine since it is a legal issue not dependent on fact findings and which would give guidance to the Ninth Circuit in the event of remand or if we are incorrect, might end this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.404" offset="11989034">I think that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.419" offset="12017037">I should like to discuss briefly the question of the adequacy of the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.947" offset="12051205">We suggest in our brief on the merits that this question has been abandoned by the petitioner below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.653" offset="12082030">It wasn't raised in the Court of Appeals and in fact, it seems to have been abandoned even in the District Court because while it was specified in the motion to dismiss the original complaint, it was not included in the subsequent motions to dismiss an amended complaint and a second amended complaint based on the identical affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.771" offset="12174503">In the motions addressed to those two subsequent complaints, the petitioner repeated the identical basis of objection that were incorporated in his original motion, the constitutionality of the denaturalization statute and res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.406" offset="12240959">But in these subsequent motions, he did not repeat the affidavit point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.663" offset="12262066">We feel that this could be taken as an abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.321" offset="12276694">And certainly, the Court of Appeals didn't mention this because the question was not raised in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.982" offset="12303339">Under the rules of the Court of Appeals, specificity of error is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.636" offset="12329880">We feel that this was not an obvious error nor was it an error which otherwise seriously affects the integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings within the meaning of the cases decided by this Court, where this Court will notice error not pointed to the -- or not brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.511" offset="12445445">I should like to turn now to the second question, and that is whether the affidavit is adequate to support the judgment on the basis the Court of Appeals supported it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.605" offset="12517752">Now, this Court pointed out in the (Inaudible) case and in the Nowak case why the affidavit of good clause was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.458" offset="12561220">It was required to protect a defendant in a denaturalization suit against ill-considered or irresponsible governmental action in instituting such a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.183" offset="12616077">Therefore, Congress required that there should first be a screening by, I believe, Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in the Nowak case referred to a responsible official who after reviewing the facts would make an affidavit setting forth the evidentiary matters justifying or showing good cause for denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.405" offset="12720985">I don't think there's any quarrel with the affidavit filed here insofar as showing good cause is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.260" offset="12748361">It recites essentially the facts which were recited in the complaint with respect to the concealment of the Communist Party membership and the court below that is the District Court found those facts sustained by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.222" offset="12812309">But petitioner argues that that is not enough, that the affidavit must, in effect, contain all the grounds on which the judgment below is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.933" offset="12871137">We don't believe that that is so and if I may draw an analogy, I'd like to compare the affidavit of good cause with the requirement that probable cause be shown under the Fourth Amendment to warrant an arrest or search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.316" offset="12936652">As this Court pointed out in the Baumgartner case, the quality of the evidence or the standard for determining the adequacy of a showing of probable cause differs from the evidence which the Government must use to prove a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.615" offset="13009795">And we feel similarly that the evidence which must be shown to satisfy the statutory mandate that there be good cause for denaturalization is not the same as the evidence which the Government must educe to prove a denaturalization case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.043" offset="13091506">Moreover, we feel that the petitioner or any defendant would gain no meaningful protection from such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.342" offset="13136750">The affidavit when executed is a safeguard against departmental irresponsibility in starting such a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.102" offset="13183770">The complaint tells the defendant what charges he must defend against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.586" offset="13209684">In combination, they give him an adequate safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.161" offset="13227969">We don't feel that Congress in addition to requiring a showing of good cause intended that the affidavit include everything that the complaint must include, such a reading of the statute would make the affidavit and the complaint almost identical and would render the complaint meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.615" offset="13325876">Now, this Court pointed out in the Schneiderman case that it is to the complaint that the defendant must look to see what he must defend against and the Government may not base a denaturalization decree on a ground not stated in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.744" offset="13398392">Even though it is stated in the accompanying affidavit, the reverse does not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.587" offset="13421693">We feel that there is adequate protection to a defendant in a denaturalization case if there is an affidavit setting forth one good cause for denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.503" offset="13473416">We do not feel that the statutory mandate is violated if instead of there being one good cause, there turned out to be two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.134" offset="13519914">Now, a petitioner has mentioned the fact that this could be used as a device perhaps for alleging one ground in the affidavit and then abandoning that and using an entirely different ground in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.155" offset="13592012">That would indicate bad faith and we agree that there should be no bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.249" offset="13612387">But that is not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.738" offset="13622314">Here, the affidavit set forth good cause for denaturalization and the Government proved that case, the concealment of the Communist Party membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.161" offset="13679992">In addition, the Government proved a little more but we feel that taking into account the purpose of the affidavit, this affidavit was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.195" offset="13724191">Now, I should like to discuss the question of materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.334" offset="13748746">And as I said, we disagree with petitioner in the criteria for determining materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.105" offset="13787826">We feel that a misrepresentation in a naturalization case is material if there's a reasonable possibility though not a certainty, that the alien would have been denied naturalization if the truth had been revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.996" offset="13859401">It must be remembered that naturalization, although it is a judicial proceeding is not the usual proceeding for the vindication of existing rights, rather it is a proceeding to have granted to the petitioning alien rights which have not yet come into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.191" offset="13956159">That was the position this Court pointed out many years ago in Manning versus United States 278 United States 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.382" offset="13996910">And the burden of proof in a naturalization proceeding is on the petitioning alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.004" offset="14031391">Any doubt as to whether he may see eligibility requirements must be resolved against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.481" offset="14061275">The Congress has laid down some specific eligibility requirements and has set up machinery so that the existence of those requirements can be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.780" offset="14122506">And as I pointed out before, since these requirements very often relate to state of mind, that is what's going on in this petitioner's mind with respect to his attitude toward Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.895" offset="14174960">In the final analysis whether he has those requirements depends upon his good faith during the course of a naturalization examination preceding his court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.371" offset="14228877">This is underscored by the fact that hundreds of thousands of petitions are filed each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.624" offset="14253850">As a matter of fact, in fiscal year 1940 when this petition was filed, some 278,000 petitions were filed and there were 201 examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.672" offset="14306095">Naturalization is not like a commercial transaction where the parties may deal with one another at arm's length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.402" offset="14332949">The courts have frequently said that the petitioner must deal in good faith with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.965" offset="14363251">In fact, one court said the alien must deal with the utmost good faith toward the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.276" offset="14396479">Now, with respect to the question of materiality, some of the elements which Congress has required and which are important, such as attachment to the principles of the Constitution depend for their ascertainment on subsidiary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.646" offset="14465964">Attached within good moral character are ultimate conclusory facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.832" offset="14490728">But from the very beginning of the naturalization process, the naturalization examiners have inquired into certain subsidiary facts to determine the existence of these ultimate findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.382" offset="14556871">And as I pointed out, the arrest question which is material to good moral character has been in the naturalization, regulations and in the form itself since 1929 even though arrest questions were asked even before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.230" offset="14640253">The arrest question can also furnish information or leads with respect to other elements of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.075" offset="14699708">This was -- we feel possible right in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.108" offset="14723845">We feel for example if the petitioner had revealed these arrests minor though they may seem in the context of the times back in 1940, the investigator on checking and finding the nature of the arrests might very well have pursued these leads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.350" offset="14828753">It must be recalled that in 1940, the war had broken out in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.273" offset="14856443">The Stalin-Hitler Pact was of recent memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.620" offset="14877863">There were numerous inquiries into the extent to which foreign organizations and ideologies were -- in all of the United States, the German-American Bund was being inquired into the Communist Party certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.011" offset="14947453">There were various legislative inquiries both on the national and state level into these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.799" offset="14978591">The Smith Act and other acts, which seem to have been directed at the Communist Party, were enacted in June 27th -- June 28th, 1940, the very day after this petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.660" offset="15038046">The -- the question of membership in the Communist Party was being inquired into by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not only in connection with naturalization petitions but also in connection with deportation possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.041" offset="15099486">So that had the arrests been revealed, the investigator or perhaps even the judge might have been led to inquire -- what were -- what was the nature of the hand-bills which he was charged with distributing and whose behalf where they're being distributed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.726" offset="15194258">What was the nature of the oration or harangue which led to his arrest, assuming that -- that there was such an oration or harangue?</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.460" offset="15229262">What was the nature of the conduct which led to his arrest for breach of the peace?</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.541" offset="15253504">All these might do without necessarily inquiring or without the fact that he had been convicted because he wasn't, we assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.277" offset="15292479">And in those days outside investigations were authorized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.948" offset="15331140">In other words, reliance was not had solely on the examination by the naturalization examiner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3875.329" offset="15604694">In fact, notwithstanding conviction sometimes because not all convictions necessarily point to poor moral characters and they feel of the underlying conduct which is the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.812" offset="15650670">All I'm saying is that arrests are material to good moral character and the time to investigate is at the time the petitioner applies for naturalization where he blocks a material inquiry such as this by his misrepresentation then I say that that misrepresentation is material to his naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.222" offset="15772296">I'd like to draw a parallel here between naturalization and some of the other types of inquiries during the course of which misrepresentations are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.020" offset="15819421">For example, in the course of a judicial inquiry such as a trial or a grand jury inquest, if a full statement is made and that blocks or torts the inquiry or has a tendency to block the inquiry, the full statement is precarious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.607" offset="15929762">There need not be any showing that it would necessarily have altered the result.Counsel has stretched the word "procured" in the present statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.610" offset="15977827">We feel that bad word does not have a significance, counsel attributes to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.806" offset="16006562">In the prior statutes, the 1906 Act and the Nationality Act of 1940 which did not come into effect until shortly after this petitioner was naturalized, the denaturalization provision relating to fraud was on the ground of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.790" offset="16094542">The word "procured" was not used with respect to the fraud ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.410" offset="16120978">I know of no court decision stating that the Government had to prove that naturalization would have been denied had the truth been revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.275" offset="16172492">In fact, it is my recollection that the Montalbano case which we cite in our brief and the Corrado case which is cited in our brief were under that statute and they stated quite the contrary that if a relevant line of inquiry -- a material inquiry to arrest his blot then the Government does not have to show that it would have resulted in the denial of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.762" offset="16282415">I believe that the -- the great majority of the circuits which have considered this question have gone along with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.531" offset="16317524">Now, the -- the legislative history of the change does not indicate that Congress intended any change in the standards of materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.266" offset="16356394">The 1952 Act under which this proceeding was brought was the result of an intensive study by the Subcommittee on immigration of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.063" offset="16415640">That study went on for two years and the Subcommittee brought out a report, Senate Report 1515 in the 81st Congress, which analyzed the existing laws and made recommendations for changes which were incorporated in the new bill which became the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.048" offset="16487528">Now, the Subcommittee analyzed the denaturalization provision and pointed out that there had been a couple of courts which had questioned whether denaturalization could behead for intrinsic fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.649" offset="16545938">And therefore to obviate any question, they recommended the present language in order to make it a little more explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.283" offset="16588466">There was no suggestion that the word "procured" was to have any particular significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.441" offset="16613125">As a matter of fact in the same 1952 Act, there was a parallel provision in the deportation section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.939" offset="16647084">Section 212 (a) (19) of the 1952 Act has a provision authorizing the exclusion and consequent deportation of any alien who has procured a visa or other document by willful misrepresentation of a material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.861" offset="16746768">Now, in the cases which deal with deportation with the materiality of a misrepresentation, we find that the same standard for which we contend is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.107" offset="16807790">As a matter of fact, in the (Inaudible) case which was decided in the Southern District of New York and affirmed by the Second Circuit on the language -- on the opinion I should say of Judge Dimmick there and that -- in which this Court denied certiorari last Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.442" offset="16897128">The Court sent forth a very good reason for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.145" offset="16927953">A decision that an alien may make a full statement in his application for a visa, we could substitute for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.012" offset="16959404">In order to avoid the raising of a substantial question as to his eligibility and then if he is caught in the full statement after having successfully trumped off investigation may try out his eligibility just as if nothing had happened would it seems to me be an invitation to full swearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.415" offset="17044982">There are also additional reasons why we feel that the same standard should apply with respect to the materiality of naturalization falsifications as applied to the falsifications in the course of other governmental inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.218" offset="17124289">The First Circuit in the case of Landen v. Clark stated this so well that I'd like to quote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.654" offset="17174026">In that case, the First Circuit reversed the District Court, which had held that the Government must show that the visa would have to be denied in order to show materiality.</text>

            <text syncTime="5238.188" offset="21056136">I'd now like to bring up the point that Justice Stewart alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.168" offset="21088005">It maybe true that lying to the naturalization examine law on a matter which is not material maybe evidence of bad moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.931" offset="21143071">And when I say not material I mean not material in the sense that the lie wouldn't made it -- that note was purposeless in the sense that if he told the truth, it wouldn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.862" offset="21182777">But that's to an irrelevant fact, Justice Stewart, because of the fact that the denaturalization statute does not, as it now reach and as it passed since the Immigration and Nationality Act was enacted, does not authorize denaturalization just because the person was ineligible for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.564" offset="21285595">It does not authorize denaturalization because naturalization was wrongly or improvidently or even illegally granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.344" offset="21320704">It authorizes denaturalization only where there was a misrepresentation or concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.132" offset="21359888">This incidentally is a change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.821" offset="21370650">So the fact that the man was a person of bad moral character, even if was -- he was shown to be such by his misrepresentation, does not bring him under the denaturalization statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="5348.518" offset="21497396">It says that you will be denaturalized an account of a naturalization which was procured by a concealment or misrepresentation and I don't see how you can say that naturalization was procured by a falsification unless you show that it is a falsification which made a difference to the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.028" offset="21619440">Now, let me get in terms of the fire plug parking analogy, and I think that's very good to show the differences between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.850" offset="21654758">Now, I -- it seem to me that Mr. Roberts vacillated somewhat on his answer to whether lying about fire plug parking was or was not a denaturalizing fact and I thought that he ended up by saying, "Yes, it was caused for denaturalization but maybe a judge or the Immigration Service in such circumstances would give the individual a break and they wouldn't -- they wouldn't press it."</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.753" offset="21770428">Now, the way I look at it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.028" offset="21787460">I say that if the alien, the applicant for naturalization lied about this fire plug parking, it might or might not be cause for denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.706" offset="21838242">If all you showed was that he lied, then you haven't carried the burden of materiality, because obviously he has not suppressed a fact which would have made any difference to the naturalizing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.108" offset="21899786">So if the Government really wants to use that to denaturalize him, then they should do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.528" offset="21921520">There might be a case in which they should do it then the Government might show that this man parked in front of the fire hydrant because he was trying to -- to perpetuate a scheme of arson and this was a way of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.451" offset="21993200">And if he had told the Immigration Service about this arrest, you -- it might reasonably have led the Immigration Service to discover an attempted arson and if they had discovered that, that might well be relevant to his good moral character and might have led the naturalizing court to deny him citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.217" offset="22084211">The point I'm making is that you can't look at it from a point of abstraction like they're doing about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.491" offset="22109288">Is it the kind of thing that sounds bad or it doesn't sound bad?</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.504" offset="22133426">The burden is on the Government to show whether or not that misrepresentation, whether it's about fire plug parking or anything else would resulted in or had in effect on the procurement of naturalization and that very often maybe a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.871" offset="22226840">A question of what was -- why did he conceal this fire plug parking.</text>

            <text syncTime="5782.055" offset="23231613">And it's particularly an unsound rule when you think of some of the questions that some of the subordinate officials or the Immigration Service thinks worth asking.</text>
