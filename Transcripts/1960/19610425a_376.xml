            <text syncTime="9.755" offset="142399">This case involves the question of which spouse is liable for tax on child support payments, payments which are paid by the husband to the wife under a separation agreement or a divorce decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.793" offset="202585">A conflict has developed among the Circuits as to the interpretation of the language of the statute after the statute had been applied in accordance with the Commissioner's position over a period of about 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.173" offset="264025">The primary question, therefore, we believe as one of the statutory construction, specifically the meanings -- the meaning of two words in this statute, the words, "payable for."</text>
            <text syncTime="52.341" offset="312717">The controversial language is found in Section 22 (k) which has set forth in petitioner's brief on page 35.</text>

            <text syncTime="65.111" offset="363813">The 54 code Your Honor is substantially the -- the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.017" offset="379486">The only change makes it conform to a change -- that Congress had in mind that the agreement did not have to particularly attach itself with divorce decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.622" offset="421909">It could be a separate maintenance without divorce decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.592" offset="433716">Otherwise, it's substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.740" offset="446360">Now, there is also a treasure regulation of implementing this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.781" offset="466526">It's found in the petitioner's brief and it starts at page 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.335" offset="484707">But it does not cover this point directly, the -- the pointing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.385" offset="504874">In combination with Section 23 (u) which was found on 36, 22 (k) provides as a general rule that the support payments will be taxable to the wife, deductible by the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.745" offset="554402">However, the Section draws a distinction between alimony and child support payments and we're concerned here today with the provisions for child support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.099" offset="599751">The statute assumes from its wording that -- and that this is genially the case that the periodic payments from the husband and the wife will include both alimony and child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.410" offset="644995">But it released the tax on and we call the Court's attention to the second sentence of 22 (k) on page 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.907" offset="674983">It released that the wife, the tax on that part of the periodic payment which is fixed by the terms of the instrument as being payable for child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.898" offset="718973">Now, therefore, the terms of the instrument either divorce decree or the agreement must fix an amount payable for child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.102" offset="751783">Now, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue since 1942 has been fought -- has been following a practice, a consistent practice of interpreting the statute to mean that the words "payable for" simply mean that an amount must be set aside by the terms of the instrument as payable for child support allocated or apportioned for child support looking to the purpose of the payment irrespective of how the wife uses the money and how the wife uses the money is the heart of this case, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.077" offset="895666">Now, in contrast, the Second Circuit, fall out reasonably by the Sixth Circuit takes a much more strict review of the wording of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.354" offset="920743">In his opinion below, the Second Circuit says that the words payable for have reference to terms and in agreement which must fix an amount that must be used by the wife solely and exclusively for the children without regard or whether she feels that the money should be used for herself, maybe for the best interest of -- of all her children without exercising any discretion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.817" offset="1030666">The Second Circuit says she -- she may not have discretion as to the use since she can have no possibility of a beneficial interest in herself.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="239.728" offset="1062327">Even to say she may not have of any discretion as between the beneficiaries namely the children or that she may not have any -- any discretion to use the portion of that part for herself?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.459" offset="1129200">But first, it means that she may not spend any of it on herself and the opinion uses this language, even if the expenditure on herself may in the long run be the best for the group, for instance to buy a house or a rug for a home or an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.164" offset="1196074">Now, the Court says that she may have no discretion at all as to the use of this money.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.604" offset="1213837">It goes on to say -- even to this extent that the wife may feel that it might be necessary for one period of time to keep the children at home, not giving them free spending money, but she may not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.653" offset="1265977">She must give the children the amount of money set aside in the instruments so they may use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.861" offset="1290846">If she hasn't discretion, then, this does not fit the language according to the opinion of the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.026" offset="1319476">Do you think the Second Circuit actually that the money had to be given to the children or -- or simply spend it exclusively on their behalf for their benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.727" offset="1354271">We don't feel that it means that it has to hand it to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.015" offset="1371408">But, it -- it uses this -- this language that the wife under this reduction clause in this agreement, might at one time feel that best to keep the children home and not give them free spending money.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.318" offset="1424593">It even goes on to indicate in its opinion that the wife should have no control over the money and that even possession is suspect as to whether she has it.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.831" offset="1466702">Language that we think is much more stricter than that -- much more strict than that call for about a statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.735" offset="1550294">We think that would depend upon state law of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.461" offset="1565236">You would have to look to the law of the individual state to decide whether she's a fiduciary to not, whether she's a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.547" offset="1597524">A Congress in -- in the words of the statute would not require that she'll be a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.884" offset="1618944">Congress does not require that -- that a certain amount be used or spent on the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.501" offset="1641409">It says, that if an amount can be determined from this instrument as payable for child support, then, for tax purposes, we will say that is not income to the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.650" offset="1689997">It is deductible to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.649" offset="1693968">Now, there are some States, Your Honor that require that a wife must act as a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.882" offset="1710895">There are other States to say the wife may use this money as she thinks best to support the children in the manner which they are accustomed and the Court will not make her spend it the way that husband wants her to spend it for instance or somebody else may want to spend it as long as she's supporting the children.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.712" offset="1846209">This is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.462" offset="1849240">And we say that regardless to our position on how she spends the money, even on herself, would be permissible under the statute because if she should use the money improperly, this would be a matter for the husband, for the divorce court, for the State or the public which are always parties do, a domestic relations proceeding to come in and hold her accountable but for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.362" offset="1944848">When Congress says, "That if we can find from the terms of this instrument that amount is payable for child support."</text>
            <text syncTime="465.922" offset="1967104">And then most significantly, they go to the next sentence and we refer you again to page 35 of the brief, the third sentence of this Section which covers partial payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.172" offset="2016110">If a husband is -- is making payments for the support of his wife and his children and he makes a -- he defaults on part of the payment and he only pays part of it, Congress says, "That for the purpose of this exception and for the purposes of taxes, we will consider whatever he pays going first to the support of the children."</text>
            <text syncTime="495.240" offset="2084342">And then the balances go to the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.998" offset="2091342">And Congress there was not trying to directly use.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.220" offset="2100224">The -- the wife may receive this money and under the very nature of things, have to spend a little bit on herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.128" offset="2123839">Congress was not trying to police the agreements as it went along.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.553" offset="2141602">He was trying to fix the tax at a certain point.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.169" offset="2156022">Now, the difference in the statutory interpretation between the Commissioner's position and the Commission of the Second Circuit revolves around the reduction clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.304" offset="2188622">A reduction clause that is -- has been in all of the reported cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.194" offset="2208162">Now, the taxpayer here agrees to pay his wife a certain percentage of his income for her support and the support of three children.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.405" offset="2237001">He doesn't say that X dollars is set aside to support the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.528" offset="2253511">He does say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.229" offset="2260302">He says that, "The payments to the wife will be reduced one-sixth upon the death, the marriage or the emancipation of any of the three children."</text>
            <text syncTime="548.558" offset="2297605">Now, anyone of these events if it should occur would terminate his obligations to support the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.519" offset="2317458">If the children -- child dies, if child becomes emancipated or marries, then his obligation under the law of California ceases.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.084" offset="2347760">Now, prior to that time, prior to the ceasing of his obligations and support, we think that it's fairly obvious that 316 are one-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.278" offset="2384436">He has set aside and here, marked as payable for the child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.579" offset="2405648">Now, there are numerous cases, 25 and the tax court, Sixth Circuit Court to Courts of Appeal decisions which hold that -- that a reduction clause which is based upon an event that will -- that will terminate the obligations to support the children satisfies the agreement -- satisfied the statute and the reason for that is that you can calculate with precision the exact amount that it has been paid for child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.184" offset="2520064">The reduction clause in the instant case we feel is the most important and the heart of the case, but taxpayer on brief at least makes a factual argument and we would state very briefly, if the Court's permission, a few of the other facts, particularly those relied on by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.468" offset="2585266">Because the payments are based upon a percentage of his income, there was a maximum fixed for each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.704" offset="2606164">All payments were to -- to cease if the wife remarried, and the parties agreed to pay the taxes assessable against each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.907" offset="2647019">In 1942, and we think this -- this history is most important, in 1942 following the so-called alimony trust cases, the decision is handed down by this Court, Congress passed this Section of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.034" offset="2707519">It wanted to change the law, but it made a distinction between alimony and child support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.963" offset="2735208">Now, prior to 1942, the decision of this Court had held that payments made by a husband to his wife for her alimony or the setting up of a trust with the income to go to the wife would be considered as a general rule as income to him not deductible and not income to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.302" offset="2812531">And now of course, the exception was that if there was an alterable agreement and a decree and a particular State according to state law that fix that obligation, it couldn't be changed and it satisfies obligation, then, the general rule had been accepted and the husband then could deduct the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.884" offset="2898944">So, Congress changed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.190" offset="2904168">They had to switch the basic law as decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.932" offset="2919111">It made a distinction between alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.015" offset="2927470">And in doing so, it provided this that -- that if the -- the husband could not deduct the portion of the expense, if the agreement that he had entered into or if the divorce decree had terms in it but set aside and it uses a portion of this amount as fixed and as payable for the support of children, then Congress out of the sentence that we had in mind, which we think is most significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.343" offset="3020779">The sentence it says, "If there was a partial payment, we will consider it for tax purposes as going towards the support of the children."</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.471" offset="5513279">Now, the Commissioner has held that reduction clauses do not do this when the wife wants to show use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.889" offset="5534908">The courts have held that all reduction clauses do not fit the situation, and we agree with that, for instance, the one that the reduction would be only if the wife remarries, this continuously may never come in to being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.194" offset="5584123">The Commissioner does not -- does not pursue this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.860" offset="5594781">But if you can tell that the obligation for this would be out that the reduction will occur when the obligation support the child ceases, then you can tell exactly how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.441" offset="5657161">We feel that there -- Your Honors that there's nothing in the development of the law and the legislative history in the wording of the statute that requires this strict and rigid interpretation of the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.442" offset="5945135">Before I get into the discussion of -- of -- outside of the case, I'd like to point of two very important points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.443" offset="5981184">Number one, that we don't share the -- the contention of the petitioner that under the Weil case, the wife has no discretion about spending the money on the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.761" offset="6034369">She has a discretion, but it has to be spent on the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.160" offset="6048057">She can spend it only on the children anyway in her -- in her discretion because she has the custody of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.950" offset="6079195">And also, I want to point out that under the Ninth Circuit ruling in the Eisinger case, their position is not correct there either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.787" offset="6110542">Because even in the Ninth Circuit in California, this very case would be adjudicated the same way the Second Circuit adjudicated for that simple reason --</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Mandel</label>
            <text syncTime="1515.795" offset="6166549">-- for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.797" offset="6174595">In the Eisinger case, there -- the whole payment was a $125 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.982" offset="6215346">And if she remarried, it was reduced to $62.50 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.494" offset="6241364">The Court in the Eisinger case held as in the Budd case that when she remarried, the $62.50 was the amount that was set aside for the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.800" offset="6282533">Now, in the case before the Court now, that very point was avoided because if she remarries, there is nothing left for the children, although the custody remains with the -- with the wife, they were afraid possibly there might be an adjudication or might be stretching the statutes somewhere along the line to the point where they would not treat these alimonies so everything ceases the moment she remarries so that this alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.540" offset="6397576">In other words, the Budd case had $500 a week -- a $500 a month that was reduced to $200 a month in case she remarried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.389" offset="6436968">And they held that $200 a month was for the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.528" offset="6449507">Again, the same principle in this case, nothing is left when she remarries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.094" offset="6467793">So we're not -- in -- in contradiction to the Eisinger case in the -- in the Ninth Circuit, now I'll go on with more of these cases but I'd like to get back to my case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Mandel</label>
            <text syncTime="1620.158" offset="6583986">I can square that by the simple intent of the whole agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.792" offset="6598510">The intent of the whole agreement was to state within Section 22 (k) as I will expand my whole -- my whole case when I -- when I -- and the only -- the only reason they -- they recognized and the law doesn't prohibit that and the history of the statute when Congress will prove my point too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.356" offset="6676773">That the -- the exchange between the people that take care of this situation didn't prohibit any change in the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.708" offset="6710209">For instance, if she went to Florida and lived there, there was no cold or there was no -- no need for schooling or supposing they had decided that during college years of the children that so much would be paid increased to decreased or part of the money were to be spent and given to the child for college.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.848" offset="6794742">All of these didn't prohibit -- these changes were not prohibited at all as long as you didn't allocate and then fix them for the children in the overall agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.123" offset="6831835">In other words, we could change if it's cold, heavy winter, we could have more money if college -- kids -- the child that was to go to college, we could provide conditions under which they would increase or decrease because it was built on the family need the whole overall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.198" offset="6896201">And when we examined the whole thing in light of the -- of the history of the statute, when the practice of the statute, I think all this would become very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.989" offset="6947297">I think, when we -- the first thing I -- I must say that -- and to start my -- my argument, I -- if this statute, I -- I will cover it in five points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.589" offset="7005706">First, we'll discuss the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.546" offset="7017514">If this -- if one approaches this statute with sincerity and simplicity and doesn't want to read anything into it, they must come away with the meaning that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.560" offset="7069654">And that this disagreement before the Court was in -- within the purview of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.323" offset="7104658">Using -- using the language of Judge Hand in -- in talking about the statute, he said, "The statute is plain language patently chosen with care."</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.606" offset="7157844">Now, if you'll approach the statute from that point of view with simplicity and sincerity, it does not show any complications until you come to the word fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.094" offset="7203715">When you come to the word fix, then again if you lose your simplicity and sincerity, you can get confuse very much about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.880" offset="7230882">But what Congress meant was to fix the amount for the support of the -- of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.701" offset="7250213">Now, fix means fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.738" offset="7266304">In other words, if you want to give $500 amount to -- to the wife, you gave a $500, you said a $100 was for the support of the children, that would fix it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.164" offset="7316041">Congress did not mean when they created the statute to create a track for the taxpayer that he could fall and to be ruined financially for the rest of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.701" offset="7382183">It did not mean for -- for the taxpayer to get into a separation agreement where any agent who is so inclined would examine it with a microscope, and using the -- the words of the -- of the Weil case, say comes through the agreement with such care to find a word or sentence that it could hang on the word fixed and then brought and fixed from its original intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.157" offset="7500048">This was not the intention of the statute and it becomes much more apparent when you go into the history and the purposes of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.722" offset="7534216">Mr. Mandel, would you tell me how this might become a trap for -- for the husband?</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.318" offset="7568593">You're under the impression you're going within -- within the purview of 22 (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.689" offset="7594088">And you draw such a separation agreement because the statute permits you to give an amount, a whole amount to the wife for everything with -- and it shall be alimony, it doesn't prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.476" offset="7637243">That is the history of the statute and I'll point out later intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.849" offset="7658768">So, if -- if an agent could go through an agreement and find some little thing that is so contrary to the whole intention, and then say this means fixed when it's not fixed, and brought it from its original intention fixed as fixed a $100 for the support of the child, $200 for the support of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.332" offset="7736717">Not a case where you reduce a payment and you say that's for the support of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.399" offset="7760959">So, therefore, if -- it opens broadness there that any -- any agent could go in there and find the sentence or word that he can say this fixes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.011" offset="7803382">And then use that as a means and then the taxpayer finds himself in the situation as again, I will show in the history of the tax of the purpose of this statute that he has -- he's in the big surtax bracket and he hasn't got enough money to pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.379" offset="7868897">If this Court will permit me to get into the history of the statute and how it came about, I think a lot of these answer will -- will come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.414" offset="7905050">The history of the statute and the purposes was three-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.166" offset="7924067">They were aid to relieve a tax burden the existed for such families that were separated and divorced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.862" offset="7954787">And now had greater expenses and they had before and yet they didn't have the advantage of the family tax bracket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.860" offset="7986761">In other words, since we're separate living apart under the tax rule, they had a single status even though they were married and even had more expense because the two families will be having more -- two homes instead of one before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.162" offset="8047992">Two, it was created for the purpose of the maximum that the recipient of the money shall pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.270" offset="8092400">In other words, the principle was that the husband was just a conduit for which -- through which the -- the wife got his money that is if he earned it, but she got all the money so the principle that the recipient of the money should pay the taxes, that was another reason for which it was created, the record will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.076" offset="8171708">And the third reason it was created, because of the surtax situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.708" offset="8190203">In other words, they conceive the situation whereby some allowance or some agreement where the husband would give so much away that his surtax brackets were so high that if that amount were not deductible from him and the tax on it was payable by the wife, that he wouldn't have enough money to pay the taxes on the whole amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.811" offset="8290617">If that part of it payable to wife -- to the wife were not charged to the wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.380" offset="8308903">Now, these are the three reasons in the history of it shows, may I point to three parts of the congressional record where this very problem was -- was discussed and confronted and this very purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.241" offset="8368358">It turns to page 8 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.667" offset="8382046">It has -- page 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.926" offset="8395107">It has the report of the Senate Committee and that -- may I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.888" offset="8414960">It reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.875" offset="8418826">"If however, the periodic payments and the trust income are more conceived by the wife for the support and maintenance of herself and of minor children of the husband without such a specific designation of the portion for the support of such children, then the whole of such amount is includible in the income of the wife as provided in Section 22 (k) and in Section 171."</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.074" offset="8527705">Now, further down, we also have another portion which -- which came out in the hearings on this question and it's in the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.667" offset="8578069">"If however, that amount paid the wife includes support of children, but no amount is specified for the support of the children, the entire amount goes into the income of the wife."</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.634" offset="8637942">This is part of -- of the Senate's record and this is a part -- this is a very question that they discussed at that point and part of the free reasons for enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.961" offset="8687261">Now, that's the reason for the statute and the reason for not complicating the word fix that's there, as Judge Hand said it's a simple word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.299" offset="8728534">Now, let us turn to the agreement that's before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.557" offset="8757582">The agreement before the Court intends to stay within the purview of this statute and I will list the things it did and the intentions manifested in the agreement for -- for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.190" offset="8828113">Number one, it pays as high as 50%, it starts out as paying as high as 50% of the gross income of the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.652" offset="8865938">The record clearly shows that his expenses, his taxes on -- on file in this case run over 40% of his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.694" offset="8906167">Now, 50 and 40 that means he had left less than 9% for his state and federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.218" offset="8936260">If he will burden on any part of the wife's 50%, he never could made his taxes, he had nothing left for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.722" offset="8970219">So, the very intention in the payments at the beginning indicates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.677" offset="8990072">Number two, there's a paragraph that refers to taxes in the agreement and it says for -- up to the point of this agreement, they shall file a joint return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.961" offset="9035212">After this agreement, they shall file separate returns each reporting their own income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.332" offset="9060707">Now, the -- the intention was the very intention put together with number one was that she was to report the money that she -- she got and he was to report the money he was left with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.209" offset="9116191">Three, it provides that she pay the taxes on that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.941" offset="9143150">And my worthy opponent is a little - is torturing that section of payment of taxes as that was brought out by Judge Whittaker by trying to say -- Justice Whittaker by trying to say that $15,600 that she was to get after payment of taxes, he wants to now to say she was going to get not $15,600 but she was going to get $7800 tax free and $7800 after she paid the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.236" offset="9272299">Now, the agreement doesn't indicate anything like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.321" offset="9396642">He refers to that tax clause that she would only pay on taxes that would leave us $7800 and not $15,600.</text>
