            <text syncTime="21.342" offset="188792">This is a patent infringement suit brought by the respondent to get the petitioner for infringement of the Mackie-Duluk patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.980" offset="223274">That was held valid and infringed by the District Court which also held contributorily infringed and no misuse was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.892" offset="258905">The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.403" offset="276982">The Mackie-Duluk patent relates to a combination of elements in a convertible car construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.077" offset="307702">The patent comprises the body of a car withholding both structures supported on the body of a car, a fabric on the bow structure extending down into the car and secured within the body of the car just below the bodyline.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.115" offset="379800">A wiper arm supported on the holding bow mechanism is used to force the fabric ultimately against the body of the car in order to affect the watertight seal at the bodyline.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.929" offset="451062">The patent relates specifically to the means for affecting this automatic seal at the bodyline of the car in order to prevent water from entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.762" offset="506441">The fabric itself was cleaned in a combination of elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.356" offset="532773">Every claim in the patent related to the combination of holding bow mechanism, the body of the car, the wiper on and the fabric in a specific operative relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.913" offset="579062">It was never claimed in the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.127" offset="591914">It was never claimed in the file -- in the prosecution of patent to the fabric itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.542" offset="621589">The combination was embodied in the General Motor Cars from 1950 to 1953 and at some models in 1954.It was also incorporated from 1952 to 1954 portion of the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.772" offset="686477">The fabric itself was the only wearable component of a patented combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.936" offset="707166">The other elements were found to be relatively permanent and would normally last the life of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.697" offset="730154">The fabric would wear and would normally be replaced for every three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.960" offset="755231">Because of the nature of the automotive industry, the automobile manufacturers were not interested in the replacement of these fabrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.272" offset="792430">Consequently, they're sizable replacement fabric industry in which these manufacturers make these fabrics for replacement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.881" offset="838928">The petitioner in this case in Massachusetts Corporation and Partnership or perhaps the national leaders in this particular replacement field, they have been making these fabrics and selling them at kit form for installation for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.874" offset="914892">These kits are sold to distributors and jobbers who in turn install it.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.807" offset="934640">All that is sold is the fabric for installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.660" offset="946030">The kits include primarily the fabric especially designed to fit the General Motor and Ford cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.993" offset="975391">The petition themselves except for incidental installation occasionally for test purposes in a very, very small amount of regular replacement don't do any installations.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.144" offset="1087927">It has a flop or a prolongation at the sides which extend into the body of the car and it's secured there by hinds on a truck so that when water comes down at the top of the car, if it isn't stop behind the pressure of the wiper arm against the fabric and the body, it'll be taken up to destruct and drain out.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.442" offset="1177161">But in answer to your question, the fabric itself was not, if I assume the question correctly, is not itself unique in shape.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.914" offset="1327000">I call to your attention that in figure 1 of the patent, only a portion of the entire fabric top is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.036" offset="1355525">In other words, there was never a disclosure of a complete fabric top, only the fragmentary portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.905" offset="1379035">If the Court is interested in -- in embodiment of an installation, there are several of them.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Wolf</label>
            <text syncTime="355.898" offset="1526993">We're looking from the trunk of the car through the back window.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.746" offset="1562311">There -- the -- the respondent corporation is apparently a patentable incorporation that owns only a territorial right in this patent in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.109" offset="1639842">It was organized approximately 22 days before the suit was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.578" offset="1657710">It received a territorial assignment in the patent to Massachusetts only about 10 days before the suit was -- was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.886" offset="1694908">It received this assignment, this territorial assignment from another patent owning company called Automobile Body Research.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.632" offset="1729912">Automobile Body Research had a -- had a companion patent to this particular patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.618" offset="1753840">Automobile Body also had a number of -- well, had several licenses outstanding, had one with General Motors and one with the Ford Motor Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.291" offset="1800547">Both of these licenses call for payment of royalties on this unpatented fabric when it was -- when they were sold as replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.927" offset="1847045">And these -- these royalties or the -- the requirement of royalties was paid with -- with a condition as long as the license was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.185" offset="1888110">The fact that the -- the petitioner in this case manufactures fabrics for replacement purposes brings, into a question, a well-known doctrine as to whether or not a user, and consequently a manufacturer, has the right to maintain and repair patented combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.029" offset="1971493">The Government is going to present use with respect to that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.538" offset="1997511">As I understand the Government's position is that a user, and consequently a supplier, of unpatented replacement fabrics has the right to make those replacements without payment of further royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.892" offset="2058951">Once the patent owner has acquired or has received payments of the patented combination and once that original installations passed monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.100" offset="2099806">We're primarily concerned with the question of whether or not the petitioner in this case has the right to sell fabrics for any purpose or whether the patent can be used for the purpose of controlling this unpatented fabric which was never claimed during the -- at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.974" offset="2199280">A patent defines an exception to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.162" offset="2224044">This exception is in particularly defined by the claims of the invention, by the claims which appeared at the end of the -- the patent itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.557" offset="2269602">It's long been held by this Court in many decisions starting with the Motion Picture patent case going down through Carbice -- Carbice case and most recently with the Mercoid case, cannot use a patent to control the sale of unpatented component of that particular patented combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.509" offset="2349432">Even though that particular patent component was an essential element and even though, in some instances, it was termed the heart of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.658" offset="2389974">The Congress recognizing importance of this particular requirement, the requirement of an inventor to find specific terms of what he claims his invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.522" offset="2433442">They did this by enacting a whole title, Title 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.627" offset="2449847">In this particular title, is the requirement of the inventor set forth in his application that which he claims his invention must be defined specifically and clearly, the examiners and the patent office will clearly -- will look at the -- this particular claim or these claims whatever is submitted and examine the file to determine whether or not this is an invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.222" offset="2544306">And the way they do it is they look at this particular claim or the claims above, they draw themselves a picture of what's described.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.511" offset="2569383">And then they go and look through what -- what's defined queer eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.944" offset="2587146">In other words, this -- this claim is a word picture of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.243" offset="2604387">Now, if the claim doesn't describe a particular element, the patent examiners won't look for it and that's just what happened in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.141" offset="2643884">The patent never looked for the fabric alone because it was never claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.009" offset="2667395">The claims also served other functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.919" offset="2675022">They served the function in telling the public what they can make and what can't make.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.475" offset="2693308">They also serve the function of telling the inventor what he can -- what he use as a charge for infringement or what he can't use as a charge of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.757" offset="2734373">Now, respondent in this particular case says, "Well, we don't have to squabble with this claim because this fabric is an element of the patented combination and it's an important element of patented combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.892" offset="2790902">Now, we can come in under the statute 35 U.S.C. which says, "If you make a material part of a patented combination and it's not a staple or a commodity of commerce, we're entitled to monopolize it."</text>
            <text syncTime="684.729" offset="2842311">But let's take a look at this 35 U.S.C. 271 -- pardon me, 271 -- 271 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="693.080" offset="2875643">This appears on page 76 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.752" offset="2902392">Now, the language paraphrasing it is whoever sells a component of a patented machine, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringement."</text>
            <text syncTime="726.330" offset="3008658">Now, the keywords we believe in this particular statute are the phrases "material part" and also the phrase "suitable for substantial noninfringing use".</text>
            <text syncTime="738.507" offset="3057351">Now, you can interpret the word "material part" to mean a single unpatented essential element with patented combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.716" offset="3090265">But the real question is, was this the purpose of that particular phrase?</text>
            <text syncTime="752.987" offset="3115342">If you look at the legislative history of 271 (c), it's perfectly clear that Congress intended to codify existing case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.062" offset="3167587">271 (c) was not intended to make new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.905" offset="3182947">And in codifying prior existing case law, the Congress codified several cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="851.633" offset="3509896">In the respondent's brief, he has made the specific statement that the clear and concise definition of contributory infringement now in the statute and every element of that definition represents no more than a codification of what is long and consistently believed and recognized as contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.154" offset="3576038">So I don't believe that they are contesting that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.518" offset="3589413">But the four cases, I'd like to call the Court's attention, of the Mercoid case and the Carbice case which I think clearly indicate what is not contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.717" offset="3634239">Now, on the other side of the line, we have two lower court decisions which were called to the Committee's attention and they're referred to our -- in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.867" offset="3666840">One is the Wallace versus Holmes case, the other is the Amalgamated Dental case.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.564" offset="3685648">And these cases considered what this word "material part" is.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.063" offset="3699649">I'd like to first mention this Wallace versus Holmes case because that particular case was a very early case.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.723" offset="3722219">It was discussed in the Committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.386" offset="3732877">That particular case had a -- had a claim relating to a lamp burner mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.473" offset="3773315">If -- the claim is reproduced in our reply brief, on page 5, the bottom of page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.576" offset="3809677">Now, this particular claim recited a lot of elements in a lamp burner mechanism with a glass chimney which was especially designed to fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.348" offset="3844786">The defendant in that particular case made everything but the glass chimney.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.901" offset="3866937">The Court in that case said this is an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.962" offset="3879267">Well, they didn't it was an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.102" offset="3883760">They said this is a virtual infringement because the defendant here is making substantially everything but the background element of the glass chimney.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.371" offset="3932871">And so we're going to hold them liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.444" offset="3953142">It's interesting to note in this case, this was the very first instance of the word -- to use the word "material".</text>
            <text syncTime="968.390" offset="3976965">And the Committee reports, they -- they indicate that this was a part of our law for 80 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.702" offset="3998177">And this was an 1871 case, so I suspect that the Court may have had reference to this particular case when they were considering what material was.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.662" offset="4037987">But you see here, there was a making of substantially the entire combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.344" offset="4060766">There was not a making of a single element or the sale of a single element.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.745" offset="4082395">The other case that was caught to the Committee's attention was Amalgamated Dental case.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.837" offset="4098696">There was a case in which there were four chemicals in making a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.547" offset="4117608">The defendant in that case was selling four chemicals without the aqueous solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.807" offset="4142582">And the judge in that case recognized that they were making substantially the patented invention except for the background element of the aqueous solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.347" offset="4172779">And they said -- the judge said, "I'm going to hold the defendant liable on this particular case because he is making the substance of the invention."</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.905" offset="4202977">And incidentally, in that case, the judge on the District Court never recognized that this was different than Mercoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.807" offset="4238608">Now, those are the two cases which illustrate what contributory infringement should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.146" offset="4255953">Now, what contributory infringement should not be was decided several times by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.029" offset="4279463">One is the Carbice case and one is the Mercoid case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.560" offset="4289599">Perhaps I -- I ought to consider the Mercoid case first because this -- that case, as far as I can see, is undistinguishable in all respects from this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.995" offset="4335365">In the Mercoid case, the patent related to a furnace system in which one of the elements was a specially designed thermostat which was alleged to be the heart of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.489" offset="4405373">Now, the Mercoid Corporation was selling these especially designed switches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.817" offset="4426689">They were suit for contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.775" offset="4438497">In that case, this Court said the attempt to hold Mercoid and the attempt to control the sale of these unpatented components is a misuse of the patent and they refused to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.556" offset="4501608">The Carbice case is also similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.443" offset="4513102">In that case, there was patent on the combination of the -- of dry ice and the package in which the dry ice was packed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.034" offset="4547480">The defendant in that case was selling dry ice with the knowledge that it was being used in a particular patented combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.581" offset="4581648">There, the Court said you can't control an unpatented component.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.513" offset="4601396">Now, we believe all these cases clearly in this -- illustrate that the word "material" in this particular context really means the substance of the patented invention minus, perhaps, a background element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.138" offset="4663881">I think if you'll look at it in that term, you will -- you will see that this particular statute does make some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.809" offset="4698572">If you interpret it to mean an unpatented component even though it's essential, you see it implying in the face of the rest of the statute which -- which set up a very elaborate system for examining these -- these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.829" offset="4762728">If you say we're going to protect this unpatented component what you're saying is that every man can be his own patent office and every man by virtue of going into a -- the patent office in getting a claim and a combination adding some element has -- can thereby acquire a right to control the individual components all be it not themselves inventions and not patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.042" offset="4867532">I'd like to go one step further than -- on this point on contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.294" offset="4896580">That is the actions of the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.824" offset="4914657">Now, the facts stated in our brief are fairly complete on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.663" offset="4942033">But if you -- in the -- in the record you will see there are several licensing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.150" offset="4967946">One is with Ford, one is with General Motors and one is with Atlas International, a competitor of the petitioner in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.111" offset="5003786">Now, all of these licensing agreements conditioned the right to continue the use of patented combination upon an agreement to pay a royalty on the -- on the unpatented fabrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.794" offset="5074526">The language, for example, in the Atlas International agreement says, "Licensee will pay a royalty on any replacement top made, used or sold by a licensee without regard to whether such top is covered by either of the patents which by its peculiar shape or the construction is adapted to use in one or more of the following cars."</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.902" offset="5151013">There's a whole long list of these cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.685" offset="5166164">And there are some other requirements in this particular agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.796" offset="5298552">Buy from Atlas International, they have a license."</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.861" offset="5310777">And we believe this is a very clear showing of substantial damage to the -- to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.361" offset="5348812">We believe that this case comes clearly within the scope of the International Salt case and that there has been a clear showing of violations of the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.203" offset="5412133">We -- we believe that there has been a substantial attempt to monopolize the sale of unpatented fabrics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.369" offset="5444838">And in this particular area of commerce, it's a -- not an insubstantial area at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.016" offset="5475453">In the record, there was evidence of the amount of royalties of this Atlas International has paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.789" offset="5506487">And in one year alone, these royalties amounted to $14,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.708" offset="5526235">Now, if you calculate the amount of tops necessary to generate $14,000 worth of royalties under their particular licensing agreement, you come up with a fee of something close to a half a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.346" offset="5596766">This, as far as I can see, is a very substantial area of commerce which the -- which -- which has been monopolized or which has attempted to -- be monopolized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.519" offset="6065403">Well, our -- our answer to that question is that the -- the Automobile Body Research Corporation signed an agreement with the Ford Motor Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.724" offset="6110229">That agreement purports to be a release rather than a license but I say that it is immaterial as to what you've defined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.465" offset="6149204">And the important point was that Automobile Body got paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.240" offset="6168325">And as soon as they got paid, for -- for this particular -- this particular -- for instance, their monopoly rights in that patented combination ended and they had no more right to claim anything with respect to those particular combinations which were -- which was sold and which were released by that particular agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.689" offset="6250141">There is a further answer to your question and that answer is that -- that if this Court holds that the General Motor Corporation replacement fabrics or fabrics for those particular cars were -- were improperly made the subject matter of this licensing agreement, then there has been a misuse and that in -- in view of this misuse, the respondent has no right under the Morton Salt case, enforces patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.460" offset="6393187">There are -- there are two other issues which we have raised and I would just like to briefly allude to them because they are fairly well spelled out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.580" offset="6437700">The first is that since this is a patent and since this is an exception to the antitrust laws, the patent was -- or an exception to antitrust laws, a patent owner is subjecting himself when he comes to the Court with much greater scrutiny as to his equitable content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.516" offset="6505409">We called to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.304" offset="6512619">The respondent in this case was obviously going to shell corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.229" offset="6532263">And in our opinion, obviously formed as a shell corporation to dodge -- to dodge discovery proceedings and this -- this would clearly was the case when we tried to find out certain facts and also for the purpose of isolating the companion to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.437" offset="6597151">Now, we believe that this is an equitable content which should not be tolerated in a patent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.875" offset="6622856">When a man comes in to court with a patent, he should be made to put it on the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.583" offset="6641664">He should be made to stand up and say, "This is my invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.826" offset="6650650">I am going to be subject to the scrutiny as to whether or not it's a good patent."</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.073" offset="6667682">He should not be allowed to take part of that patent and hide it in a separate corporation so that it would still collect royalties on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.049" offset="6699551">There is also a constitutional issue involved which I think we spelled out in our brief which would not be met by this Court unless they found that the interpretation on 271 (c) reached by the respondent is the correct interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.425" offset="6961089">There was no charge of infringement in the sense that Aro's, having supplied a manufacturer with material which he in turn might use to install the original top.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.810" offset="7746644">And that part is the only point I've been tending to make that far is that we don't deal with alleged infringement by automobile manufacturers about their suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.900" offset="7790947">And thus, I think the primary focus of inquiry becomes this whether an individual, an ordinary consumer who has bought a convertible automobile from one who was authorized to make it in the way that he did, whether that consumer -- when the fabric wears out, two or three years later, exceeds his rights, if he goes ahead and replaced it with either himself or with someone else's aid with another new fabric of similar design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.650" offset="7946010">Now, I think everybody in this case concedes that if there is no direct infringement, if it's not an infringement by the automobile owner to replace the fabric that then there is no issue in contributory infringement because without the direct infringement, no one can be contributing to an infringement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2362.471" offset="9553272">And the findings on that were at page 36 of the record and at that point, Judge Aldrich was pointing out, I'm looking about half way down the page, he was pointing out what the investors -- 36, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.282" offset="9632475">He was pointing out what he thought the inventors of this particular convertible top had accomplished and he said, "Rather than affixing the fabric, the tonneau itself they attached it to a trough or gutter and then he goes on to describe how water would be directed into a trough and carried out by a drain, how a wiping arm would be utilized in order to affect the seal and I shouldn't go into the details, but I do want to make the point that there's no room in this case, I think were the suggestion, that the car owner's replacement of the fabric alone could constitute either a replacement or a substantial replacement of the entire system which was the subject of the combination patent claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.259" offset="9864443">Perhaps, I should also add parenthetically that there is no obstacle or whatever provided a patentee and make the requisite showing that the standard of invention meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.840" offset="9926719">There's no obstacle whatever to obtaining a patent on the combination and patent rights in relation to a sub-combination or an ingredient element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.957" offset="9979173">This Court has recognized that one can obtain both kind of protection, the patent office in -- in numerable instances just granted patent rights both in relation to a combination and in relation to an ingredient element of the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.896" offset="10059003">And so what we have here essentially is the -- a result in this case which permits the patentee who has only claimed the combination of the entire system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.250" offset="10112397">A result which permits him to accomplish the very thing that he could've accomplished assuming that this fabric was separately patentable that he could've accomplished if he'd gone to the patent office made the claim and subjected it to the scrutiny to which it then would've been subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.981" offset="10195257">Now, how does the court below reach the conclusion of the patentee's rights were trespassed by the fore owner's replacement of the fabric?</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.093" offset="10239770">It deals with that -- it's the Court of Appeals summarizes this position at page 655 of the record which is a very thin volume and -- on that page, it notes that the fabric is not a minor or relatively inexpensive component, then goes on to add that the fabric does not wear out after a very short period of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.936" offset="10359097">Although it recognizes it at the same time that the life of the fabric is several times shorter than the life of the invertible top assembly as a whole or to deal it as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.705" offset="10422209">And then it finally concludes that the car owner would not rationally believe that he was making only a minor repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.540" offset="10457527">In our view, the Court had gotten the wrong answer in this case because it has asked the wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.675" offset="10490023">We think the question is not whether the unpatented component is major or minor, expensive or inexpensive, not whether it wears out every two months or every two years, the question ultimately to be answered by the Court is whether the man who has bought the article and thereby obtained the implied right to used it, the question is whether he has abused that right by making a new article, by recreating the entire combination which alone is the subject that protects.</text>
