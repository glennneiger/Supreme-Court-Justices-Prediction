            <text syncTime="29.596" offset="222730">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.144" offset="248957">I would like to correct a mistake I think which occurred unintentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.090" offset="276752">Mr. Burger I believe stated that the next case was a case of the Two Guys from Harrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.284" offset="301516">I represent seven defendants -- seven appellants who sustained a criminal conviction in Anne Arundel County, State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.368" offset="345819">Incidentally, these appellants work for the Two Guys from Harrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.930" offset="368076">So that actually I think he had reference to the case that is following me rather than this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.551" offset="398587">My clients work for the Two Guys from Harrison which is a large retail establishment in the County of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.707" offset="435263">Within the confines of this establishment are so many, many things as has been testified almost everything under the sun.On a Sunday, the police arrested these people and they were charged with selling, two of them were convicted of -- convicted for selling a three-ring loose-leaf notebook, four of them were convicted for selling a stapler and staplers, one was convicted of selling a toy submarine.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.448" offset="558143">These convictions were sustained by our Appellate Court of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.941" offset="584161">I think -- we claim that these convictions are not proper and that in light of the First and Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution should not be sustained and should be overthrown in this Court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.240" offset="645392">In order to more clearly familiarize ourselves with the Sunday Blue Laws, I think it would be well to examine the Sunday Blue Laws as they apply to the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.916" offset="696069">The first law was enacted in 1723 and remains substantially in its same form today.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.890" offset="739955">It's known as Article -- Section 492 of Article 27 which is the criminal article affecting the criminal laws of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.149" offset="784990">It is entitled the "Sabbath Breaking".</text>
            <text syncTime="173.245" offset="797424">From this Article 492 and I refer to our jurisdictional statement which outlines the Section 492.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.246" offset="853431">It says that no person whatsoever shall work or do any bodily labor on the Lord's Day, commonly called Sunday, and no person having children or servants shall command, or wittingly or willingly suffer any of them to do any manner of work or labor on the Lord's Day except works of necessity and charity always accepted, nor shall suffer or permit any children or servants to profane the Lord's Day by gaming, fishing, fowling, hunting or unlawfully pastime or unlawful pastime or recreation, and every person transgressing this Section and being hereof convicted before a justice of the peace shall forfeit $5, to be applied to the use of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.731" offset="1047364">Thereafter, a series of exceptions were carved up to this general Blue Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.064" offset="1072650">Section 521, which was enacted almost the same time as this Section and sustained a number of exceptions thereto, permit on a statewide basis the sale of certain food commodity such as soft drinks, candies, confections, milks and ice, ice cream and ices, certain tobaccos, certain motor fuels and greases, and certain periodicals to be sold on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.435" offset="1182156">This has statewide effect.Section 522, which follows the one just read, prevents on the Sabbath day, as it says, commonly called Sunday, the operations of any dancing saloon, opera house, tenpin alley, barber saloon, or bail alley -- ball alley within the -- within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.469" offset="1298244">Thereafter, a section on this 50 -- 509 which came after 521 and 522 and from that is the problem that we are facing the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.901" offset="1340040">The State of Maryland contends that my clients were convicted under the general Section of 521, which is the prohibition of the sale of items which we admit are not included within the exceptions of 521.However, 509 is a Section which applies in effect only to Anne Arundel County and it exempts from the operation of Sections 5 -- 4 -- 492, 521 and 522.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.908" offset="1475981">It says, "It shall be lawful to operate and work or to be employed in the occupations of operating any bathing beach, bathhouse, amusement park, dancing saloon, the selling or sales of any novelties, souvenirs, cut -- accessories or other merchandise essential to or customarily sold or incidental to the operation of the aforesaid businesses and occupations at retail."</text>
            <text syncTime="371.162" offset="1589039">It also gives them the right to rent beach chairs and beach umbrellas but that is not incidental to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.440" offset="1618192">So from this overall --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="379.620" offset="1622894">I mean is it considered that these exceptions apply only to Anne Arundel County?</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_silbert" startTime="384.790" stopTime="398.410">
            <label>Mr. Harry Silbert</label>
            <text syncTime="384.790" offset="1643583">I believe so, 509 is only applicable by the title to Anne Arundel County.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.362" offset="1665839">It says, "Beaches, amusement parks, picnic groves in Anne Arundel County."</text>
            <text syncTime="394.360" offset="1681826">The Code of Maryland specifically says this, "will only apply to Anne Arundel County."</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="398.410" stopTime="399.155">

            <text syncTime="398.410" offset="1698022">I see.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry Silbert</label>
            <text syncTime="399.155" offset="1701052">Now, there are great number of other sections following 492 and 521 and 522 accepting numbers of activities and sales of merchandize in the various political subdivisions of the State of Maryland, also applicable to Boulder City where we have a great multitude of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.757" offset="1767403">But 509 carves out a large exception and says that, "You can sell anything which would customarily be sold at the bathing beach, that these items are admitted to be proper -- offered for proper sale at a bathing beach is born out by the trier of facts Judge Mickelson when he tried -- when he tried this case in the nisi prius court, he said -- the Court said to counsel trying case, "If you could wave a magic wand and make all these places were the alleged violations of the law occurred bathing beaches or amusement parks why you wouldn't have much difficulty, will you, when we objected to the fact that this created an arbitrary or unreasonable classification of the law."</text>
            <text syncTime="486.733" offset="2051302">I submit to Your Honors that we, our clients, suffer pecuniary loss directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.440" offset="2090172">The preceding cases have be labored to the fact didn't or did they -- did -- did they or did they not suffer pecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.107" offset="2124863">Here, we have a mercantile establishment operated not at a bathing beach.Selling items which the Court says can be sold at a bathing beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.222" offset="2169271">Now, it so happens that the Two Guys from Harrison's retail establishment is located within a few miles of the bathing beaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.549" offset="2202603">So that, a man on his way to a bathing beach would not be able to buy a stapler, the can of wax or the toy submarine, yet he could buy that very item at a bathing beach and be solely within his legal rights as the law lies -- lays him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.184" offset="2301137">If you will refer to Judge Mickelson's decision in finding our clients guilty for the purposes of bribery, he refers to the distinction as being ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.157" offset="2361010">Ridiculous to believe that you can buy a can of beer or buy a prohibited item and yet, buy -- be able to buy an accepted item and yet not be able to buy a shirt or shirt or as he characterized it, a tailor button if you are going to a wedding or some affair on Sunday, unless you actually went to a bathing beach to buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.651" offset="2450975">Now, we say and we urge that the Court's rule is to be arbitrary and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.660" offset="2499041">We have heard that there are number of cases on point and there are number of cases which distinguish as in the Utah case, or in the Georgia case which says, "Well, you can buy" it would be -- it's not -- it is arbitrary to say that you can buy a bottle of beer and yet not buy a can of orange juice.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.151" offset="2580961">But this is a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.165" offset="2589006">This case the same item, the very item that you can buy at the bathing beach may not be sold around the corner if it doesn't face the bathing beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.819" offset="2635713">So then, if in any respect, this law can be classified we say the classification is arbitrary and unreasonable and subjected to judicial review, it does not lie within the province of a legislature even though it'd be subjected as the Harvard law review irregular review sense, that it is subjected to the private interest and the pressure groups to cut away from the law certain items which can be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.337" offset="2801748">This is the very same item that has a denial with the privilege of the law behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.145" offset="2836961">It has the effect of a law to say to one group of merchants you cannot sell a toy submarine, a can of wax, or a stapler and to say another group of merchants in the same county.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.951" offset="2888161">Not only the same state but the same county you can sell it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.411" offset="7714022">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.719" offset="7731263">I had hoped to address myself primarily to the arguments -- constitutional arguments which I considered to have been raised by this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.186" offset="7769192">However, I find it necessary at this point to restate the law of Maryland and the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.460" offset="7798241">I say first of all, that the Sunday sales law with which we are dealing which is Section 521 of Article 27 of the Maryland Code has its origins much for the fact that my brother stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.145" offset="7868980">It's not 1723.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.019" offset="7876504">It goes back into the 1600s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.606" offset="7890819">That's important for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.123" offset="7900850">The first Sunday sales law goes back to 1674 and it forbad two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.632" offset="7930943">It forbad the sale of liquor on Sunday and it forbad gambling on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.477" offset="7954348">Now, that I think is very important because we will find that the Sunday sales laws in Anne Arundel County today permit the sale of beer, wine and liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.696" offset="7995204">They permit gambling on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.701" offset="8003250">They permit one arm bandits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.943" offset="8012131">They permit the so-called slot machines of other descriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.166" offset="8029059">They permit the sale of tobacco, cigars and cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.625" offset="8042851">They permit dancing saloons which is a quaint phrase that still used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.417" offset="8062077">They permit various types of recreation of all sorts which I'll take up in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.159" offset="8085065">Now, those are basic Sunday laws and the way they come about was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.884" offset="8103978">There is a broad base Sunday law in effect in Maryland which is Section 492.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.052" offset="8128637">Now, that Sunday law says, "There shall be no work or labor."</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.950" offset="8140236">It does use the term "Lord's Day" in that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.562" offset="8154655">It goes back to the language of the ancient colonial days for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.509" offset="8170433">But that's not the Section with which we are dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.595" offset="8178792">That's the one that says, "No work or labor".</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.921" offset="8192063">The Section with which we are dealing is Section 521 which makes no reference to the Lord's Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.494" offset="8218394">It merely says that on Sunday, certain items cannot be sold and it exempts from the items or rather permits certain items to be sold which are the basic necessities, the type of thing that the housewife may run out off over the weekend such as bread, milk, fruits and also certain items for recreational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.357" offset="8313793">Now, Section 509 is a specific exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.897" offset="8331975">In answer to Mr. Justice Stewart's question, Section 509 is a specific exception applicable in Anne Arundel County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.690" offset="8367188">There are other sections dealing with other counties and under the home rule amendment, certain cities have the right by ordinance to create additional exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.862" offset="8403864">509 exempts from the general statute the one that prohibit sale except for certain items, it exempts or adds to those items which maybe sold if you will the items which we are dealing with here, namely, souvenirs, novelties, and accessories essential to or customarily sold at beaches, bathing beaches, dancing saloons and that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.064" offset="8504696">Other laws permit the sale of liquor on Sunday and other laws still permit gambling on Sunday in Anne Arundel County.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.642" offset="8647011">In this particular case, the Court recited the arguments which my brother is making here today and pointed out that it was not necessary to determine whether it apply only at the beach or whether it apply generally.</text>
