            <text syncTime="28.878" offset="218885">I feel most unfortunate that I waited a long, long time for the opportunity of coming before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.071" offset="243649">I find the two-case in which I'm going to argue, the arguments are anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.185" offset="260159">Yesterday, the argument I intended to present on Monday, the antitrust case was anticipated and today Mr. Berger I think began the argument of my case sometime before I got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.326" offset="300701">So that I may have to digress for a moment from the argument that I had intended to give and clear what I think it has to be cleared by way of the record before we begin here.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.031" offset="339466">In the first place, in our case which was begun before the 1959 Act was passed, we challenge the old 1794 Act which had become a part of the Criminal Code when all of Pennsylvania criminal laws were codified in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.346" offset="416789">The Attorney General, in his brief, at page 3 is quite clear on that and says that there are two statutes involved here - one, the old 1794 Act and the other the 1959 Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold E. Kohn</label>
            <text syncTime="96.350" offset="488782">The old statute is still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.916" offset="499022">I may say this too sir that, we had evidence in our case partly for the purpose of preventing amateur theologian on this side of the bar from giving you what might not be actually the correct theology.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.197" offset="552208">And let me perhaps explain just what Sunday and what Saturday is and to remind you what sometimes people do forget.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.442" offset="589093">It's once again, like the burner that Justice Frankfurter was interested in seeing yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.905" offset="611035">Saturday began as a religious day of rest in the Old Testament.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.123" offset="635904">You have it of course first write in Genesis at the very beginning and then very emphatically incorporated as part of the biblical law in the Ten Commandments and elsewhere throughout the Old Testament.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.661" offset="686059">Sunday has nothing whatsoever to do with that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.912" offset="702986">Sunday and Saturday, insofar as the quarrel is concerned or the theological dispute, is not a quarrel as to which is the day of rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.525" offset="737468">In other words, is the seventh day of the week Saturday or is the seventh day of the week Sunday, and this is all in the evidence which was produced below and not challenged by any contradictory evidence on the part of a commonwealth and by no witness on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.210" offset="796191">About 300 years after the resurrection when there had become a number of Christian communities which sprang from the Roman or the Gentile or pagan origin as distinguished from those which sprung from Jewish origin and after Constantine and the story we're all familiar with when in this sign he conquered and decided that he was going to make Christianity the state religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.452" offset="909145">The first thing he did was to pass a law which made Sunday, this was in 320, Sunday, which had been forever -- and has been since forever commemorated as the day of the resurrection not the day of rest, a holy day and a state enforced holy day.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.206" offset="1000155">Now, what did he do in order to make it enforce as a state holy day.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.243" offset="1020322">He took from the Jewish religion with which people were familiar that form of observance which traditionally and now for 4,000 years, I mean it's in the blood and the bone as a method of celebrating a religious event.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.172" offset="1084061">He took that which was the most solemn way of observing a religious holy day refraining from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.582" offset="1121677">Traditionally, among the Jewish people, that Sabbath was the holy day.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.713" offset="1142262">In Yom Kippur, which is for all Jews who have any religious observance at all the most sacred day of the year, the most important injunction even more important actually than fasting is the refraining from work, and we quote in our brief the admonitions in the bible that not only must I refrain of my man servant, my maid servant, the people in my house and even the animals are forbidden to work on that day in the Jewish community.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.983" offset="1251349">So that you had a combination really of two things - You had the enforcement of the pivotal doctrine in the Christian religion, namely, the resurrection observed by state compulsion through that which traditionally among the Jewish people have been the way of showing the greatest respect, namely, refraining from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.624" offset="1345912">I read Justice Holmes who said that page of history I think is worth the volume of logic and you just can't throw out of the window as the City Solicitor sought to do some 4,000 years of Jewish history and some 1,600 years of Christian and western history.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.947" offset="1419160">Judge Hastie in his opinion below recognized that all of our Sunday laws are part and parcel of the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.598" offset="1445804">Our expert witness has said pretty much along the line, I think Mr. Justice Black mentioned yesterday, it doesn't make any difference what form of words you put it in, when you tell people they cannot work on Sunday in the Judeo-Christian civilization in which we live, they know, if they give any heat to the matter, that you are enforcing respect for a religious doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.853" offset="1538800">Now, that we think is forbidden regardless of whether you approach it through Mr. Justice Frankfurter's point of view or Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Black's point of view, because whether it be the First Amendment incorporated into the Fourteenth or whether it be those fundamental liberties with which we are so much concerned which are guaranteed to us by the Fourteenth, the answer comes out the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.544" offset="1637543">You have the enforcement of a religious doctrine by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.963" offset="1659173">Now, Judge Hastie, when he discussed this matter in the court below, and if you refer to my brief, it runs through from pages 9 to 12 where he made a number of findings which were never challenged, there was no countervailing evidence whatsoever, pointed out very clearly what kind of day Sunday is.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.424" offset="1729076">At page 10, for example, “Sunday is the day designated for religious services and observances by Christian and so on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="413.054" offset="1755617">He pointed out that Sunday work, so far as health, rest, etcetera are concerned, is no different as work from work on any other day.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.403" offset="1788949">As a matter of fact, the commonwealth conceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.766" offset="1798457">In our case there was an express admission of that in the pleadings and at the hearing and the judge may define and dictated by the -- by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.083" offset="1835656">I must say, as I say, these are findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.067" offset="1847672">Now, in the next sentence or the next paragraph on page 10, the judge there did what I think anybody must do comes to an examination of the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.005" offset="1891349">He considered all of the Pennsylvania statutes together and pointed out how there were a number of exceptions to the original 1794 Act which have carved out a piece here and carved out a piece there, quite obviously, because they were not interested in keeping Sunday the day of rest but in keeping Sunday as a symbolic day of devotion to the doctrines of a Christian religion, and you can preserve the symbol even though you erode from it many of the practical work a day aspect as long as you keep as I say the symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.041" offset="2039515">Now, there are times when keeping the symbol does affect people adversely either practically or in their liberty or in their pocketbook as it does in the case of the Two Guys from Allentown, which is the store that we represent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.474" offset="2109315">He also points out it in the finding of facts which I quote on page 12 that the commonwealth of Pennsylvania has enacted a pattern of economic laws under the police power which regulate hours of work which operate completely independently of the Sunday laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.028" offset="2175457">Now, once again, our employees are unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.722" offset="2194265">They don't work more than six days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.431" offset="2205132">If John Wanamaker had decided that it is going to fight tooth and nail, the union which wants to have a six-day week and they are not unionized, you don't get round that very practical economic problem by this kind of Sunday legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.936" offset="2271065">You can have all of these Sunday statutes enforced to the hill and they are enforced and I think that's one of the vices of the Sunday legislation quite spasmodically and irregular -- irregularly and for sometimes not very fine or noble purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.023" offset="2339506">You could enforce it to the hill and you wouldn't keep people from working seven days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.724" offset="2358314">Does the man can work in a covered occupation six days and then go to the exempted occupation on the seventh?</text>
            <text syncTime="570.034" offset="2383496">Now, if you want to keep people from working seven days a week, you can do it so very easily by simply providing in a statute that they cannot work seven consecutive days and that statute is very easily enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.679" offset="2434069">We all know that the 40-hour-week for example is very, very rigidly enforced and if you can force -- if you can enforce a law which permits a man to work six hours in one day, eight hours another day, 10 hours at third, three hours the next as long as they don't add up to more than 40 hours at a week, you can certainly enforce this kind of law, which says that a man cannot work for 12 consecutive hours or 24 consecutive hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.092" offset="2543783">I don't think it's any problem on that score at all, and even if there were, I think it's entirely different from saying that because of that administrative problem you can pass legislation which has this, I think, very important symbolic content for our society as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.309" offset="2624658">And I think even a Christian could come in and complain about a law which compel him to refrain from work on Sunday or to go to church on Sunday even if seventh day Sabbatarians and everybody else were accepted, and I know that the seventh day, the men feel very strongly about that and they would --</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="648.339" offset="2696756">May I ask you if your argument leads up to the point that it would be impossible even though a state may have a right to set aside when they have read, it's impossible to set aside Sunday because of its religious significance?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="663.735" offset="2758301">In all -- beside I think that is correct, and I think in answer to -- I think it was a question asked by Justice Whittaker and I think Justice Harlan, I would say you have to go even -- it's not necessary in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.042" offset="2803545">But I think we do have a very basic constitutional issue here which I think should be discussed by counsel frankly and candidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.579" offset="2829667">I would say you can pick no day.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.518" offset="2837400">If you're going to pick a fixed day which will accomplish the purpose constitutionally that the proponents of Sunday legislation say they have in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.092" offset="2875747">If you pick Sunday, then you have the people, quite sincere people like the Braunfeld plaintiffs and Crown Kosher plaintiffs coming in and saying, “Well, yes maybe it doesn't hurt me very much but it does hurt me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="704.822" offset="2922663">And there's no reason why they should be hurt if the purpose can be accomplished otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.192" offset="2940113">If you pick Saturday, the Christians have a perfect right to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.783" offset="2954533">If you pick any other day in the week, then anybody who must observe by his dictates of his own religion, Saturday or Sunday has every reason to complain, and there's no necessity for picking any particular day.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.388" offset="3008972">You can pick, you can do just what I said, you can do with regard to 24 consecutive hours off which is more recently enforced than our real labor legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.005" offset="6571342">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.782" offset="6586493">There still seems to be some question about the exact nature of the rights of this plaintiff to raise a question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.461" offset="6613243">I want to obviate any question on that point right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.691" offset="6626095">This plaintiff is a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.947" offset="6635186">It pleads no personal or religious infringement and at no point in the case has the issue of interference with the exercise of a religion been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.520" offset="6677504">But as a corporate plaintiff being forced to remain closed on Sunday, it has suffered economic detriment and we have agreed that it has standing to raise the problem of whether or not this Sunday law is a law respecting an establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.877" offset="6738840">If we say that that's in the Fourteenth Amendment or if it affects the basic freedoms that are incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment, but it is important to remember that this plaintiff simply wants to remain open seven days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.843" offset="6794742">The record is clear that it closes, if allowed to remain free to do as it pleases, that it closes only on four days of the entire year, New Years day, Fourth of July, Christmas Day and Easter Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.960" offset="6851166">And apart from that, this plaintiff wants to remain open all of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.598" offset="6877811">I think that it's impossible to discuss the question of whether or not a Pennsylvanian Sunday law violates the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment in the nature that we've describe without looking at history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.200" offset="6932146">Not only the history that Mr. Kohn's discussed, that is, what was the original intent of Sunday observance at the time of Constantine, but also Pennsylvania history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.608" offset="6977808">What do we have in Pennsylvania?</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.306" offset="6996616">I think we're all familiar with the fact that Pennsylvania was founded under a royal charter given to William Penn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.547" offset="7025560">When William Penn drafted the first frame of his government in 1682, he included as Article 22 of that frame a provision that said the first day of the week shall not be used for ordinary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.729" offset="7090239">It was a very brief provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.605" offset="7101837">There was also enacted shortly thereafter several of the laws in England that applied to the new Pennsylvania colony when the colonist came here immediately thereafter and that dealt with a Sunday law very much like the 1939 codification that we have before us to the effect that every first day of the week called the Lord's Day, people shall abstain from their common daily labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.544" offset="7213537">This provision of the original laws of Pennsylvania and found in the first frame of government in 1682 was carried through several successive laws over the next 112 years, the Pennsylvania history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.840" offset="7278738">Until in the Act of 1794, that was promulgated by the general assembly of Pennsylvania enact very much like the present provisions that we find in the 1939 Penal Code Section 699.4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.280" offset="7348537">This being so, how can we explain Pennsylvania's devotion to religious freedom which is as much a part of the history of the founding of Pennsylvania as the fact that we had established churches in other colonies as part of the history of those colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.847" offset="7418755">Pennsylvania never had an established church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.030" offset="7435473">William Penn expressly provided for religious freedom in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.645" offset="7457938">At no time, where these tenants violated from the day it was founded until today and I refer for example to the first constitution of Pennsylvania enacted after the founding of the federal system of Government in this country under the Federal Constitution of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.138" offset="7543933">That Constitution, the Constitution of 1790, expressly provided that all men shall have freedom to worship or not to worship as they please and that the State shall give no preferment to any religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.785" offset="7606523">This being so is it possible to say that this Sunday law is a law respecting an establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.349" offset="7636720">In the Braunfeld case, which you heard earlier today, Justice Frankfurter mentioned the Virginia bill for religious liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.163" offset="7663992">That bill, the outcome of large scale passionate efforts by Madison and Jefferson was enacted in 1785.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.592" offset="7701713">It was followed one year later in the Virginia legislature by a reenactment of the Virginia Sunday law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.743" offset="7734314">Now, Virginia certainly knew, having disestablished its church a year previous, what establishment meant and what laws violating religious freedom meant, and yet history shows us in Virginia as well as Pennsylvania that these Sunday laws formed an integral part of the community and the social fabric of the laws of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.972" offset="7835251">Secondly, let us take the reference made by the plaintiffs here to various expressions in opinions of the Pennsylvania Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.310" offset="7880600">They cite a quotation in Updergraph against the Commonwealth, an 1824 decision of our Supreme Court to the effect that Christianity is part of the common law of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.543" offset="7933576">On its face, it's hard to explain that statement, but if you look at the paragraph in which that statement appears, I think you get a completely different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.272" offset="7972446">I'd like to quote it, “Christianity, general Christianity, is and always has been part of the common law of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.138" offset="8011943">Christianity without the spiritual artillery of European countries; for this Christianity was one of the considerations of the Royal Charter, and the very basis of its great founder William Penn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.538" offset="8065546">Not Christianity founded on any particular religious tenets; not Christianity within established church and tithes in spiritual courts, but Christianity with liberty of conscience for all men.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.276" offset="8124479">Even this Court has had occasion to refer to that statement and to the Updergraph case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.756" offset="8150392">In the famous case of Vidal against Girard's Executors, handed down by this Court in 1844, you said, “It is also said and truly that the Christian religion is part of the common law of Pennsylvania, but this proposition is to be received with its appropriate qualifications and in connection with the Bill of Rights of that state as found in its constitution of Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.349" offset="8256763">Then quoting the provisions from the Constitution that you went on to say “language more comprehensive for the complete protection of every variety of religious opinion could scarcely be used and it must have been intended to extend equally to all sex whether they believe in Christianity or not and whether they were Jews or infidels so that we are compelled to admit that although Christianity be part of the common law of the state, yet it is so in this qualified sense that is divine origin and truth are admitted, and therefore, it is not to be maliciously and openly reviled blasphemed against to the annoyance of the believers or the injury of the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.960" offset="8439202">It's interesting to note that the Updegraph case itself was simply a case involving a conviction for blasphemy, the very thing that the Supreme Court in the Vidal case refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.159" offset="8484028">So I say --</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.198" offset="9156211">In this background, I want to then refer to several things that the plaintiff here has referred to in his paper books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.469" offset="9189230">Eight times in the paper books filed by the plaintiff, and I include the jurisdictional statement, the brief in our position to the motion to affirm, the brief on the merits and the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.414" offset="9229040">The plaintiff has said or implied very directly that the court below made explicit findings of fact that Sunday laws are religious in origin purpose and defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.631" offset="9289853">I'd like to examine just what the court below did say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.033" offset="9307512">The references which the plaintiffs made or to the portions of the record on pages 280, 281, 286 and 290 to 292; on page 280, in the paragraph beginning shortly before the bottom of the -- middle of the page, right after middle of the page, Judge Hastie said, “We think it cannot be seriously questioned that in their relation to the first day, Sabbath has an institution of Christianity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.962" offset="9451186">The New York and Pennsylvania statutes have a common background and were, in original conception, designed to the same end.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.760" offset="9490369">I would say, I think fairly that all Judge Hastie was pointing to it at that point was that historically religious considerations of some nature played a part in the passage of Sunday laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.990" offset="9555362">He repeats very much the same thing on page 281 where he says, “The historical religious connection is clear on both state statutes as to be obvious and indisputable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.734" offset="9598307">I might add that what he was doing here was comparing the Freedman case which you heard so much about with the present situation in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.136" offset="9631953">Over on page 286, of course, the only reference as to the fact that he mentions that the factual statement shall constitute the findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.409" offset="9661001">And on page 290, we find supplementary findings of fact of which number one refers to the nature of Sunday as a day designated for religious observance by Christians except for the seventh day believers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.188" offset="9728084">No question is made that in historical origin religious problems played a part in the enactment of these laws but the plaintiffs have gone on to say that in purpose and effect, present purpose and present effect, if you please, in their brief on the merits, Judge Hastie found as a fact that these were religious laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.539" offset="9805511">I say that the plaintiffs are wrong that there is nothing in the record whatsoever that would enable us to say Judge Hastie made such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.369" offset="9840828">Furthermore, they go further on page 17 of their brief, in the last paragraph they state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.761" offset="9874369">“It seems equally clear that the findings of the court below that”, and now quoting the court below, “The required sensation of business on Sunday is an enforced expression of respect for and acknowledgment of the sacred character in religious symbolism of the Christian Sabbath, a religious institution commemorating the resurrection of Christ”, then referring to page 276 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.097" offset="9971754">If such a finding of fact were made by the court below, I think I would be in very dark trouble at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.349" offset="9992756">But let's look at page 276 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.519" offset="10009475">Here's what Judge Hastie says in the middle paragraph, “Plaintiff attacks the Pennsylvania legislation commanding the cessation of certain worldly activity on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.600" offset="10049808">The state action promoting an establishment of religion contrary to the prohibition of the First Amendment is made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.489" offset="10085334">The argument is that this required cessation of business on Sunday is an enforced expression of respect for an acknowledgement of the sacred character and religious symbolism of the Christian Sabbath, a religious institution commemorating the resurrection of Christ.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.372" offset="10148864">I failed to find any finding of fact by Judge Hastie that this is what Sunday is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.955" offset="10171225">I only find an expression by Judge Hastie that this is what the plaintiffs are arguing and yet in their brief on the merits, the plaintiff flatly state that this is a finding of fact made by Judge Hastie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.647" offset="10213961">I might add that he goes on to say that there are many persons who sincerely believe that this is what Sunday is meant to do in the modern world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.494" offset="10249383">But I also say that that is hardly of finding of fact by the Court that bears on the constitutionality of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.447" offset="10273207">It simply his view that certain persons feel that these Sunday observances infringe their personal beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.699" offset="10302151">It's not a constitutional determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.129" offset="10351888">Going on to some of the other arguments that are raised by the plaintiff in this case, beyond the religious one, and I reemphasize that the only religious argument is the one that you would call the establishment question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.015" offset="10403401">They also raise questions of whether or not the laws violate -- these two laws violate the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment quite apart from any religious issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.436" offset="10461080">Their argument basically centers on the 1959 statute because that is the statute that says you cannot sell at retail certain specified commodities and those are the commodities which this plaintiff wants to sell on Sunday and every other day of the week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.772" offset="10530461">I find that the answer to this problem can be best expressed not by me but simply by what Judge Hastie said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.732" offset="10570271">In his decision that Judge Hastie found, and this appears on page 284 of the record, which is part of his opinion, that the circumstances attending or existing at the time of the enactment of this 1959 Act affirmatively suggest a rational basis for the legislative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.465" offset="10665253">If this is so, and he goes on to explain what he means, if this is so, I find it very difficult for the plaintiffs now to say that Judge Hastie's findings of the facts supporting the promulgation of that legislation can be disregarded by them but they can accuse us to disregarding explicit findings which Judge Hastie, they say made, which he didn't make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.322" offset="10756681">It's our view that the legislative background of the 1959 Act is so clear in Judge Hastie's opinion and it's so apparent that it's hard to say that there's any violation of the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.080" offset="10807672">We must assume that if you can think of any rational basis for the enactment of this law, it must be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.381" offset="10836929">We're not here to decide whether we would agree with that legislature or whether we would, as members of the legislature, have voted for the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.423" offset="10869112">We're only here to determine if that legislature have the power constitutionally to enact it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.811" offset="10890637">Judge Hastie felt without question they did and he found that the circumstances justify this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.783" offset="10914461">Furthermore, this Court has held several times that the burden is placed upon any plaintiff who was seeking to strike down a law on this basis is great indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.792" offset="10966497">In the Lindsley case, which we refer to on page 48 of our brief, the rules are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.046" offset="10991574">I know of no case which has ever deviated from these rules or said they no longer apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.595" offset="11013726">Plaintiff has not even begun to meet the burden placed on them in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.178" offset="11052074">The plaintiffs raised other attacks on the law, their attacks which they haven't mentioned in the oral argument and which they haven't spent much or any time at all in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.938" offset="11099094">One deals with whether or not defines in the act are oppressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.249" offset="11116335">I'll follow the plaintiff's lead and not speak too much to that myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.325" offset="11132635">It's covered in the brief on pages 53 and 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.113" offset="11147786">I think the law is very clear that this is pretty basically a matter of legislative concern and most defines are so great that this Court can say, as a matter of law, that they are absolutely oppressive and in fact in some cases, this Court has said they have to be so great as to oppress the plaintiff not to contest them with penalties that would be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.413" offset="11240991">That certainly isn't the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.061" offset="11259591">I want also to discuss a final point which the plaintiffs have not discussed in their oral argument, but most of the record is taken up with the problem raised by this question and that is the question that's not in any of the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.486" offset="11313298">Did the District Attorney of Lehigh County enforce these laws in the discriminatory fashion?</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.675" offset="11342033">This is quite a part, of course, from the question of the constitutionality of the laws themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.407" offset="11368991">In answering that question, I think a preliminary question has to be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.072" offset="11387695">The District Attorney of Lehigh County, at the time these laws were being enforced and at the time this case arose, was Paul McGinley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.613" offset="11421863">You will note in the title to the case that the appellees, the defendants, are Paul McGinley, District Attorney County of Lehigh, Pennsylvania and George J. Joseph, District Attorney County of Lehigh, Pennsylvania substituted additional defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.612" offset="11481840">What happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.372" offset="11488841">Mr. McGinley's term of office as District Attorney terminated on January 4 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.785" offset="11514546">He had served in that office in accordance with the statutes of Pennsylvania for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.612" offset="11549863">Mr. Joseph succeeded him having been duly elected the preceding November.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.746" offset="11570343">When plaintiffs here presented a motion to the court below to substitute Mr. Joseph in the case and I will take full blame for the technical nicety that was overlooked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.872" offset="11614856">A motion asked that he be substituted as a substituted additional defendant not that he be substituted in place of Mr. McGinley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.907" offset="11663026">First, I find nothing in the federal rules that allow such a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.261" offset="11680371">Rule 25 (d) expressly discusses the problem of substitution of the public officer and it points out that you can do so in order to preserve the question of the constitutionality of a statute being enforced by that officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.259" offset="11752364">And it is our contention that for several reasons, this phase of the case, discriminatory enforcement, is no longer before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.286" offset="11788518">First of all, if you didn't have Rule 25 (d) at all would be thrown back on the old decisions of this Court that say such an action would abate when the public officer leaves office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.038" offset="11839509">Second, Rule 25 (d) being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.349" offset="11864795">We have nothing in the rule as I pointed out that allows the retention of a former public officer when the only issue relates to a discriminatory enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.686" offset="11918085">Third, even if we stretch the rule to try to cover this case, the rule says you have to have an allegation that whatever you're alleging is invalid will continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.441" offset="11961135">And in this case, the plaintiffs in their motion alleged that the new District Attorney will not continue this pattern of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.327" offset="11992691">Fourth, and it's a very technical point, I'd never heard of a substituted additional defendant except when you have third party practice involved, joinders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.778" offset="12030516">And finally and I think most important is this, in this case the plaintiffs are seeking equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.170" offset="12056012">They want an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.017" offset="12063431">As the first ground for seeking that injunction they alleged the invalidity of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.014" offset="12087463">They base that invalidity on the grounds we've discussed, religious nature of the statute and second, the violation of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.730" offset="12118288">Second, passed that point they say, they asked for an injunction on the ground that District Attorney McGinley enforced the statute in an arbitrary and discriminatory fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.843" offset="12174712">They seek no monetary damages from Mr. McGinley or his actions as District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.872" offset="12202820">What this means is that the plaintiffs here are asking the Court to pass upon a question of enforcement and obtain an injunction against the public official who is no longer a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.606" offset="12253811">Since Mr. McGinley is no longer District Attorney, he can't enforce the statute and an injunction against him would be meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.393" offset="12280978">It would simply be an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.408" offset="12292995">It would be a moot act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.434" offset="12301145">It would have no significance whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.188" offset="12316087">Third, under the 1959 statute as Judge Hastie found, Mr. McGinley never had an opportunity to enforce that the Act was passed subsequent to the institution of this case and at the time when Mr. McGinley was under restraint issued by the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.171" offset="12388080">So in every respect that I can think of, there's no grounds whatsoever for going into the entire question at all of whether or not there was discriminatory enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.099" offset="12431757">The plaintiffs haven't answered any of these arguments in their reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.929" offset="12451088">All they have is one statement in their brief itself, which says the Court really should consider this question because down in Lehigh County, before several justices of the peace, there are still some pending criminal summary criminal cases which were brought against employees of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.067" offset="12523604">I think that the answers to this are, first, that this record doesn't raise any of those questions on the criminal prosecutions, and second, any defense on this ground which they may be allowed to raise can be raise simply in those criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.207" offset="12584208">It doesn't affect this plaintiff.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry J. Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="3145.299" offset="12684518">One was an equity case and one was a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.639" offset="12693922">I'm told by the City Solicitor of Philadelphia that the equity case is still pending on exceptions and that the criminal case, the District Attorney for various reasons concerning the record didn't feel that he should appeal and it remains in that posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.487" offset="12761318">As far as the question of discriminatory enforcement goes on the merits, we have covered that extensively in the brief in case the Court wishes to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.318" offset="12788694">As I say, the record itself is, for the large part, taken up with testimony on the nature of the enforcement in Lehigh County and doesn't deal with the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.032" offset="12835506">I will close with just one final reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.707" offset="12858180">Pennsylvania presently operates under a constitution written in 1874.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.802" offset="12882631">This constitution was preceded by a constitution written in 1838 and that, in turn, was preceded by a 1790 Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.238" offset="12916276">There was even one before that but of course the 1790 Constitution was the first one which was promulgated in Pennsylvania after the United States Constitution and after the statehood achievement of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.894" offset="12975000">In the 1873 Constitution and in the 1838 Constitution, there is repeated, almost verbatim with no significant change, if any, the language of that Constitution of 1790 which I have referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.147" offset="13043963">I'd like to read it because I think it was applicable to Pennsylvania in 1790 before the passage of this 1794 Act and it's still applicable in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.569" offset="13093700">Article 9 Section 3 states that “All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences, that no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship or to maintain any ministry against his consent, that no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience, and that no preferment shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.”</text>

          <heading>Rebuttal of Harold E. Kohn</heading>
          <turn speaker="harold_e_kohn" startTime="3285.954" stopTime="3507.110">
            <label>Mr. Harold E. Kohn</label>
            <text syncTime="3285.954" offset="13247195">Despite that constitutional provisions just been read by the Attorney General, it was from Pennsylvania that there came the Murdock case in which this Court established for the first time I think that the Fourteenth Amendment did protect this kind of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.116" offset="13315845">Now, a word about classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.251" offset="13324413">Now, I haven't argued it, probably because I haven't had time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.016" offset="13339460">Now, I do ask the Court to believe that we do have a very serious argument there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.014" offset="13367463">We could regale you for 15 or 20 minutes with the very picture as the example chosen from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.630" offset="13389928">The two lower court opinion that Mr. Justice Stewart referred to do I think set forth in just a few pages very vividly a kind of wholly capricious and irrational distinctions drawn, whether you consider this as a religious statute or whether you consider it as a statute designed to enforce a day of rest or to close up this kind of -- no matter how you look at it, it's a rational from every standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.199" offset="13484178">Now Judge Hastie, immediately after the portion that the Attorney General read to you, did say that there is testimony which establishes the fact in this record that this view of the religious significance enforce Sunday work stoppage is sincerely held by many person whose religion does not recognize the divinity or resurrection of Jesus or the sacredness of Sunday as the Lord's day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.143" offset="13579995">And then he did proceed to make the findings which we quote at pages 10 to 12 of our brief and he did say in another case, the companion case which we quote on page 28 of our brief that were not for the Freedman case, this would be in his opinion a very different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.692" offset="13646137">So, it wasn't because Judge Hastie thought the facts were against this, he felt confined by the Freedman case, and I think it's clear, I mean the judge -- being the judge he is that when he made all these findings and said in the Bargaintown case that this was a case of first impression, the constitutionality would not be free from doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.858" offset="13714787">It is quite evident what he meant when he made those findings and quite evident why he made the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.638" offset="13737880">And I think it's clear from those findings and from the evidence in this case that to borrow a word from Mr. Justice Frankfurter yesterday that there appears to be here a great legislative preoccupation with religion, whether you consider the types of exemptions that people exempt anything else, these laws one thing stand out from the preoccupation with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.083" offset="13823666">On the day, -- the one day in seven, I did want to invite the attention of the Court to the amicus brief filed by the Civil Liberty Union which I think very forcefully, very vividly, points out that the so-called problems of administration are really de minimis and we have laws like that in Pennsylvania ourselves which we have no difficulty enforcing, many other states do too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.715" offset="13918229">Finally I invite you to the amicus brief filed in the companion cases by the Synagogue's counsel which does purport and which does, I think, represent the orthodox, the conservative, and the Jewish point of view with regard to the statutes, and very clearly I think confirms the expert witness testimony under oath which I think were the good deal more than anybody as I say standing here telling you is the Jewish is not the Jewish point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.872" offset="14026898">Thank you sir.</text>
