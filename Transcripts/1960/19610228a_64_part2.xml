            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Just before the recess, we were discussing the reasons why the unions object to the Boards attempting to condition their union rapport.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.515" offset="157445">I think -- I don't think I have pointed out in this case as yet, however that here, the Board assumes in illegal agreement of some sort before it even attempts to impose a condition, it attempts to impose a condition only as a means of achieving -- of eliminating what it thinks is illegal about the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.419" offset="245008">So under the Board's own rationale if as I've indicated, the agreement is -- and must be considered legal on its face because not discriminatory on its face or an implication, then the Board's right even to impose conditions is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.628" offset="309896">Now, obviously, if the agreement were legal without these conditions, the Board would have no right to impose these three conditions because it would be a direct intrusion on the collective bargaining process which this Court in the Oliver case and in American National Insurance and the many other cases that says, "It's not the Board's function."</text>
            <text syncTime="70.934" offset="387114">It is commerce's function to impose conditions like that if it thinks the hiring hall in some way should be tampered with or if it thinks the unions and the employers should not have a right to make their own agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.264" offset="436433">That's for Congress to -- to do, not for this Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.477" offset="453256">And so, on any other postulate but -- that the agreement itself on its face is illegal, the Board would have no power to impose these conditions, I think that's clear.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert S. Thatcher</label>
            <text syncTime="312.444" offset="1353122">Well, that same rationale as I said implies to all collective bargaining agreements where the union is the -- is the exclusive representative and pretty much ingratiate themselves to use the Board's phrase or where the union has to do with the grievance settlement or where -- where if you're a union steward, you can get super seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.555" offset="1425638">All sorts of conditions in collective agreements might give unions -- might bend the employees under the agreement to get in good with the union but that doesn't -- is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.124" offset="1479868">There has to be an encouragement or a discrimination based on union membership which we haven't got here anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.251" offset="1516335">The Board merely assumes -- infers that there -- that there is some inherent encouragement in -- in hiring halls.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.549" offset="1565550">Congress didn't find so, Congress didn't think it's necessary to legislate on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.570" offset="1581641">All previous Boards didn't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.831" offset="1590732">This particular Board has relied on some or mostly about 12 cases in which this had the hiring hall actually before it and from that assumes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.523" offset="1645484">We have -- if -- if that assumption is to be made in the case of the union where the employment is channeled through the union then the Board should make the same assumptions when the employment is channeled to the employer because employers, the -- the statistics show are 10 times discriminatory as unions when they have a chance to reject or not reject on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.727" offset="1738271">So by the Board's same reasoning, these standards and -- and these three conditions should be a test to the employer's right to hire on his own when he is the exclusive source of employment, the employer because the record show, experience shows that employers are much more discriminatory than unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.062" offset="1811623">So, the whole -- that that I grab will be ridiculous but that is the Board's reasoning in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.592" offset="1837746">And that -- that that's why we say, you have to show some actual intent as in the case of Slater here get after Slater because he didn't abide by some union rule before he could be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.450" offset="1897200">In this case, Slater was discharged not because he was a good, bad or in different union member at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.354" offset="1920815">He was discharged solely because he didn't do what all other employees in industry or other casual employees in the industry do go through the contractual provisions for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.305" offset="1964596">And accordingly, all he was discharged for was for failure to comply with the proper collective agreement before the Board to -- to seek to reinstate in a given back pay as to afford the protections of the Act to deliberate contract breaker.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.729" offset="3750327">Now, the basis for the -- for the Board's conclusion is briefly this, “That an exclusive hiring arrangement, even if not in terms restricted to union members, affects a discrimination in employment by treating employees differently who seek employment directly, what the employer is distinguished from those who go through the hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.391" offset="3896926">The -- the experience of Slater here indicates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.298" offset="3920541">By going to the employer directly for this job instead of through the union hall, he suffered discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.990" offset="3959306">He -- he was able to get a job but he wasn't able to keep it.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.233" offset="3976338">There could be no clearer discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.794" offset="3994520">However, that isn't enough to establish a violation of Section 8 (a) (3), 8 (b) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="979.815" offset="4022627">The discrimination in employment has to encourage union membership and that is where the front of our case calls occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.613" offset="4077798">I'm -- I'm showing that the Board had a reasonable basis in its experience for concluding that a contract arrangement that require the employees to clear through the union before they could get a job, could reasonably tend to encourage union membership adherence to union policies and practices, absent -- the safeguards which the Board has promulgated in which I will get to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.973" offset="4235264">Now, the Board found that the hiring provisions of the contract here required the Motor Carrier of Los Angeles and Seattle to obtain casual employees solely through the dispatching service operated and controlled by the Union and that Slater was discharged for failure to follow this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.820" offset="4350621">And that the hiring procedure was invalid because it did not contain the Mountain Pacific safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.451" offset="4377161">There's no question, I might add to these safeguards are three fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.078" offset="4399731">In the first place, it must provide that -- that the basis for referral will be without regard to union membership or compliance with union rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.710" offset="4462216">The employer shall have a right to reject applicants referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.972" offset="4483218">And thirdly, that the standards for operating the hiring hall should be posted so that the employees will know what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.297" offset="4520521">Now, there's no question that this contract here did not contain a posting requirement nor did it provide for a right to reject on the part of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.771" offset="4574438">Furthermore, the Board found that the unequivocal assurance that hiring would be without regard to union membership considerations was also lacking here in that although, the contract does provide that seniority shall govern dispatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.821" offset="4690631">The gap in there is that you can only get seniority after you've worked for three months in the industry and there is no assurance in this contract that in inquire -- in acquiring the three months seniority that you will be dispatched without regard to union membership considerations and you can lose seniority if you are discharged by an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.656" offset="4809958">And that apparently is what happened to Slater here that he had lost his seniority because when he went out on a job, he wasn't able to -- to perform it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.792" offset="4870562">And as a result, he had difficulty getting the union to refer him which resulted in this effort to get an authorization from the International Representative of the union that would permit him to work without going through the hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.111" offset="4951855">And when the union learned of that, they said, “That's no good,” and procured his discharge for not getting through the hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.924" offset="4987068">So that you could lose seniority under this arrangement very readily and there was no assurance that you could build it backup without regard to your adherence to union rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.162" offset="7688025">Now, the Board, as a result of its experience with these hiring hall cases in the 10 years that they lived with them since the enactment of Taft-Hartley, found that despite the -- the ban on -- on closed shops that Taft-Hartley was supposed to have imposed, the closed shop continue to exist and by enlarge, it was present in the situations of intermittent employment where the hiring hall was the -- was the basis on which employees had to get jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.374" offset="7876838">The Board concluded that in the light of what the employees in these industries knew about the way the hiring hall was operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.129" offset="7919888">It was reasonable to infer that they would tend to be encouraged for union membership if all that you said was, “You had to go through the union in order to get a job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.341" offset="7976730">In other words, that discrimination tended to encourage union membership as the First Circuit summed up in the case in which they held with this which is referred to in our brief and if I may quote for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.820" offset="8070666">"In our opinion, the Board could well conclude that an applicant who must be cleared for a job by a union hiring hall will fear that his opportunity of selection will be small if he does not become a union member in view of the widely accepted belief often encouraged by unions themselves that hiring halls do operate in a discriminatory nature."</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.867" offset="8190830">So, the basis of the Board's Mountain Pacific decision is not that the union would necessarily discriminate in referring but that the employees would reasonably tend to believe that if they were a union member, they would stand a better chance of getting a job.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.944" offset="8771166">In the Board's view, an exclusive hiring hall contract without the safeguards has the -- has the same effect and we submit that the Board could reasonably make that judgment in the light of its experience with hiring halls.</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.081" offset="8951724">The mere fact that that rule was applied uniformly isn't enough to save it from being discriminatory if it has the encouraging effects that are prescribed by -- by 8 (a) (3) as this Court pointed out in Shelley against Kraemer, the indiscriminate application of -- of a -- of an -- of any qualities doesn't -- doesn't make it proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.300" offset="10860544">What -- what you had was the amendment of the proviso to 8 (a) (3) which banned the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.787" offset="10894503">In the next session of Congress, which was in 1949, you had the Thomas Bill which would have restored the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.035" offset="10955525">And Senator Taft proposed an amendment which would have returned to the Taft-Hartley union shop provision and he tapped on a proviso to that that said that the employer provided however, that the employer should have the right to call upon the union to refer people provided that the employer had the right to reject them because if they didn't have the right to reject then that would be a violation of -- of present law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.057" offset="11111633">That provision passed to Senate but it died in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.062" offset="11123649">It was -- it was not enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.871" offset="11134830">In the next session in 1950, you had a proposal by Senator Magnusson to authorize the hiring hall in the closed shop in the maritime industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.546" offset="11201599">That provision was not enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.785" offset="11218526">Thereafter, you get nothing until -- to my knowledge until you get to the Landrum-Griffin amendments in 1959 and this is what you get there and I think this is addressed to a question that -- also that Mr. Justice Brennan mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.175" offset="11296057">In 8 (f) of the Landrum-Griffin amendments, Congress gave special treatment to the building trades and in this 8 (f), they provided that it would not be an unfair labor practice for the building trades to enter into so called “free hire agreements,” that is a contract between a union and an employer that would recognize the union as the bargaining agent before any employees had been hired which would ordinarily be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.795" offset="11454568">Furthermore, they could provide in that contract without permitting an unfair labor practice that the employees could be required to join the union seven days after employment as distinguished from the 30 days in the 8 (a) (3) proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.942" offset="11527189">And furthermore, it would not be unlawful for the employer and the union to incorporate in -- in such an agreement a provision that would require that the union be given an opportunity to refer applicants according to objective criteria such as length of time in the area and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.038" offset="11631574">Now, that proposal when it was introduced and was ultimately enacted was criticized on the ground that it would permit hiring hall arrangements without regard to the safeguards that the Board had in its Mountain -- had enunciated in its Mountain Pacific decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.987" offset="11723316">And when this was enacted, you have a specific provision in the House conference report which is referred to on our briefs that specifically says that nothing in this 8 (f) shall be construed to affect the applicability of the Board's Mountain Pacific decision, citing the decision and the -- and the citation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.503" offset="11953403">The Board feels that the grant in Section 8 (a) (3) and in Section 8 (b) (2) to prohibit discrimination in employment which tends to encourage union membership is sufficient to enable it to cover a situation such as we have here without a specific provision in the -- in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.697" offset="12070118">This was one of those problems that Congress left to the administrative agency to work out on the basis of its experience as it did with respect to balancing the interest of employers and unions and with respect to no -- the solicitation of union membership and analogous of problems of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.721" offset="12306265">But I think that this is one of those problems like with respect to the -- like the Hot Cargo Clause problem for example, where the Board as a result of its continued experience with the problem has decided that they were wrong the first time and the experience has shown that the -- that the hiring hall itself, an exclusive hiring hall I'm talking about, not a -- a non-exclusive one where the employer would be free to -- to hire on his own but an exclusive hiring hall that requires that the employee come through that union hall before he can get a job.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.909" offset="12766960">Most -- most of them have been operated in conjunction with the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.042" offset="12791515">It's only been since Taft-Hartley that -- where -- which specifically banned the closed shop that you would get a union reporting to operate a -- a hall without specifically imposing a closed shop and the Board's experience in these cases since Taft-Hartley found that even those cases were relatively few, that most of the cases show that the -- that the hiring hall continued to be operated in conjunction with the -- with the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.130" offset="12947937">But the Board has determined that whether you can show that it has been operated that way or not standing alone without the safeguards, it violates the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.528" offset="13005511">The only thing I'm trying to point out is that although this is the Board's interpretation of 8 (a) (3), it's been the kind of problem that the Board could understandably come to this view only after some experience because it hasn't been the traditional way in which these hiring halls have operated historically and operated as an adjunct of the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.037" offset="13123480">That part has been kicked out by Taft-Hartley and it's only been since Taft-Hartley that the Board has had to face up to the problem of, "Well, what about the hiring hall standing alone?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.089" offset="13183770">And it has come to the conclusion that that standing alone without the safeguards violates 8 (a) (3) as well as one that would be discriminatorily operated for the reasons I've indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.805" offset="14754565">I think the more one listens to the Board's argument here, the more obvious it becomes that the Board is trying to do Congress' job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.791" offset="14778493">I'll just read two excerpts from legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.218" offset="14792286">Here is Senator Taft's in answer to the Thomas Bill of 1959 on page 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.049" offset="14823528">He states, “In order to make clear the real intention of Congress, it should be clearly stated that the hiring hall is not necessarily illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.430" offset="14853099">The employer should be able to make a contract with union as an employment agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.058" offset="14871594">Neither the law nor the decisions forbid hiring halls, even hiring halls operated by -- operated by unions so long as they are not so operated as to create a closed shop.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.886" offset="14910882">Then in 1959 was the Landrum-Griffin, this is on page 4 of the brief for petitioners in the following case, Number 68, and commenting upon the hiring hall provisions of the Landrum-Griffin Section, 8 (f) ongoing construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.481" offset="14981308">This is both the Senate and the House reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.611" offset="14993847">“These provisions are not intended to diminish the right of labor organizations and employers to establish an exclusive referral system of the type permitted under existing law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.127" offset="15035852">This Court, I'm afraid will have to determine what is existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.725" offset="15046301">At that time, the law was that they were legal under Mountain -- under all decisions prior to Mountain Pacific.</text>
