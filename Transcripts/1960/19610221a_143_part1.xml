            <text syncTime="21.643" offset="189942">Willie Lee Stewart has been tried for first-degree murder on three different occasions in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.836" offset="226722">The first-degree murder conviction, as you gentlemen know, carries with it the mandatory death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.134" offset="255875">On the prior two occasions, when he was tried and convicted, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed for two different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.398" offset="296939">The third time he was tried, Willie Lee Stewart took the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.626" offset="333928">In prior two trials, he did not take the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.306" offset="352632">After we had concluded our direct examination of the appellant, the prosecutor then began to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.064" offset="407594">During the course of such examination, the prosecutor secured no information or no effect of cross-examination from the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.482" offset="461302">He said to the appellant, he's about to conclude his cross-examination, "This is the first time you've taken stand, isn't it, Willie?"</text>
            <text syncTime="100.445" offset="505187">Willie says "What?"</text>
            <text syncTime="102.985" offset="515323">The prosecutor then again said, "This is the first time you have taken the stand."</text>
            <text syncTime="111.765" offset="550431">He then concluded his cross-examination, he then approached to bench and asked for a mistrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.971" offset="599228">These are words to that effect, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.382" offset="604871">He didn't -- at the first time he said, "This is the first time you've gone on the stand, isn't it, Willie?"</text>
            <text syncTime="137.688" offset="654085">I'm quoting now from page 140 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.841" offset="666728">Answer - "What?"</text>
            <text syncTime="143.107" offset="675819">Question - "This is the first time you've gone on the stand, isn't it, Willie?"</text>
            <text syncTime="149.135" offset="699956">Answer - "I am always the stand; I'm everything; I done told you."</text>
            <text syncTime="156.737" offset="730363">That was the limit of the answer to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.221" offset="752306">At the bench when we asked for a mistrial, we contended, the prosecutor had brought before the jury the fact that this man had not taken the stand on two prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.913" offset="802983">We contended that the jury was not entitled to know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.235" offset="828270">Our contention was that this man was exercising a constitutional right and a statutory right not to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.230" offset="872260">Our motion for a mistrial was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.294" offset="888560">We renewed the motion at the completion of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.610" offset="901831">We further made it the basis for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.642" offset="917922">We contend by such representation by the prosecutor -- this is more than a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.015" offset="943417">This is a representation or an assertion by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.062" offset="959613">He said, "This is the first time you have taken the stand."</text>
            <text syncTime="218.019" offset="975496">He stated it as a fact, and at the time we made the objection at the bench, the prosecutor said to Judge Letts, "This is a fact that the jury should know."</text>
            <text syncTime="231.708" offset="1030248">The fact is or the fact to which he was referring was the fact that this man had not taken the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.158" offset="1063999">We now contend that this man hadn't exercised his constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.437" offset="1089076">The jury should not have been told of the fact that he had exercised such constitutional right on two prior occasions, because of that to be true, it makes a mockery of a constitutional right to take the stand or not take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.134" offset="1151875">We further contend to this Court that that representation by the prosecutor not only breached or invaded the constitutional rights of the appellant and further suggested to the jury that this remark is susceptible of another meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.023" offset="1223450">This jury then was -- it was suggested to this jury not only that this man not take the stand on two prior occasions when he was tried for first-degree murder but he might have been tried for other crimes in which time he never took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.244" offset="1288338">We think it's a strong susceptibility of interpretation by the jury that not only was this man a murderer as alleged in the indictment, but also had a criminal record and was tried for other crimes and at no time that he ever taken the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.662" offset="1354062">We argued this case in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.991" offset="1367333">Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia asserted by a 5:4 decision, affirmed the judgment of the lower court, and said that when this man took the stand, this became part of what had they -- interpreter called "demeanor evidence."</text>
            <text syncTime="333.980" offset="1439326">Demeanor-evidence, they contended them, fell within the Raffel decision handed down by this Court and that there was an inconsistency, and if the question was relevant and competent, then the prosecutor has a right to ask this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.556" offset="1517589">We contend as we did then, there is no inconsistency between his taking the stand of the third trial and has not taken the stand on the two prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.102" offset="1571819">Where is the inconsistency?</text>
            <text syncTime="371.432" offset="1589060">If he had told a different story when he had taken the stand, either the first or second trial and gave a different story at the third trial, there would be an inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.653" offset="1637961">But how can you draw an inconsistency between his taking the stand and giving gibberish answers or indulging a meaningless behavior as the Court of Appeals for this Circuit said, "Because you cannot contrast his taking the stand with nothing when he wasn't on the stand on the two prior occasions."</text>

            <text syncTime="447.478" offset="1893334">So we contend, and as we did in the Court of Appeals that this case did not fall within the Raffel case.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.074" offset="3011688">We had psychiatric testimony to the effect that he was a moron.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.562" offset="3029661">Now, we proceeded on that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.560" offset="3041573">Now, the Court of Appeals contended this man was malingering when he took the stand, when indulged in this peculiar behavior that it was bizarre and peculiar symptoms but that this was an attempt to fool the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.092" offset="3103744">However, even if that be true, it was our position that this jury should never have known of the fact that this man didn't take the stand on two prior trials, nor should it also ever be suggested to them that he might have been involved in other offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.453" offset="3165184">And the record will reflect that he hasn't convicted of other offenses on prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.539" offset="3197576">The dissent of the Court of Appeals says that this case comes within the ruling of either Raffel or Grunewald.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.786" offset="3230490">They could -- Judge Fay said, there was no inconsistency between his behavior at the third trial, and his failure to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.756" offset="3270405">Judge Fay further said that this man, having exercised a constitutional right, came within the ruling of the Grunewald case, that the jury should never have known of that particular fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.424" offset="3345115">On -- in the brief filed here and in the Supreme Court, the Government takes an entirely different position than the opinion written in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.481" offset="3397256">In fact, I think it's further suggested, they have repudiated the ruling of the five judges in the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.291" offset="3428498">They say that this question was framed only for the purpose of memory testing to see if this man can remember, had he gone to school, was he married, had any children, and other of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.797" offset="3486595">They didn't put him on the basis of demeanor-evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.113" offset="3499865">They said the prosecutor have the right to phrase these questions for the purpose of testing the memory of the defendant when he took the stand hoping that he might have slipped if he were malingering and said something which would persuade the jury that this man was not telling the truth, it was acting or faking his insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.278" offset="3592443">However, they further, in their brief, say this that even if it was wrong, they concede the question shouldn't have been asked because they said the question was of negligible importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.694" offset="3646151">At best, it had margin materiality that is prohibitive, the value was not sufficient, because of the danger inherent and reminded the jury that this man had exercised his constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.382" offset="3708949">However, in attempting to justify that position, the Government says there was no impact upon the jury because when the question was asked, we approached the bench, the presiding judge said, “What was it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="916.602" offset="3769762">He didn't hear the question apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.937" offset="3783137">They didn't try to analogize between these situations, the fact that the Court wasn't aware of what the question was, the sequitur is then the jury didn't hear the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.360" offset="3836844">Well, I don't have to labor the obvious but I was sitting in the courtroom as was the prosecutor, as was the Court reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.018" offset="3883447">The jury as you know was at short distance from the participants in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.039" offset="3907480">Now, I was further removed as was the prosecutor and as was the court reporter from the defendant or from the prosecutor when he made this observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.994" offset="3955336">"This is the first time you've taken the stand, Willie, isn't it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="968.176" offset="3976025">Another suggests that because the Court didn't hear the question, it then followed that the jury didn't hear the question, is neither here nor there.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.992" offset="4019388">I say the fact that we hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.070" offset="4027643">It must be assumed there's no evidence in this record, which would demonstrate that the jury never heard that particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.008" offset="4059408">So not having heard that the Government now says, "It couldn't have been prejudicial to this defendant."</text>
            <text syncTime="996.960" offset="4091173">However, they alleged, go on to say that if this question was heard by the jury, its prejudice was minimal and it could have been cured by an instruction from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.701" offset="4182183">We say that that question could not have been cured by an instruction from the Court, because I think when you ask a witness or a defendant, "This is the first time you've taken the stand" I suggest the impact upon that jury is tremendously prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.741" offset="4266297">It's not insignificant, it's not minimal, and it's not maneuvered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.886" offset="4382908">Well, this man was first tried in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.641" offset="4401925">The Durham rule was not the rule in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.290" offset="4420524">That opinion came down in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.337" offset="4436720">This man could not come within the rule or in the Durham rule, and a mental defective could not raise the defense of insanity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.138" offset="4495966">In the trial in 1955, he was entitled to rely on the decision of the Court of Appeals on the Durham case as he was when we tried in 1958.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.132" offset="4551868">Now, this jury was never told that a mental defective came within the ruling of the Durham rule because they couldn't have been in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.719" offset="4598262">Then that jury might have assumed the fact that he is now claiming he's a mental defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.791" offset="4630549">He also claimed he's a mental defective in 1953 when he had no right to raise such a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.150" offset="4660015">So then that jury might have assumed that this man had that same consistent defense on three particular trials and it wasn't true, because -- and had he been a mental defective, he would have exhibited at the first trial which he couldn't do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.491" offset="4873383">We contend that is not the type of inconsistency which was intended to be the ruling of the Raffel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.888" offset="4902954">In the Raffel case, as this Court knows, at the first trial that the prohibition agent testified that when he arrested Raffel in this ginmill or whatever it was, that Raffel admitted to him that he was the owner of that particular illicit establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.577" offset="4977664">At the second trial, Raffel took the stand and he denied that he ever made such statement to the prohibition agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.178" offset="5016116">So there you have a very definite inconsistency in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.425" offset="5037119">Once you have a man not doing anything and this allegation is made, when he takes the stand at the second trial and he denies that this is not so.</text>
