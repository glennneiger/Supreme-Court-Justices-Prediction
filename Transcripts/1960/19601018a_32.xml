            <label>Mr. Robert L. Carter</label>
            <text syncTime="1140.855" offset="4667831">Our position in this case is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.275" offset="4677548">We take the position that that this is purely a case of racial discrimination, solely and simply racial discrimination that the natural result of the passage of Act 140 was to put out of the city limit that -- indicated in this map, all the areas of concentrated Negro residents without affecting any white persons and without affecting any of these white qualified voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.132" offset="4772948">Now, the -- as you can see on -- on here, that what the map does, what the -- what the new -- the change is due is to weave in and -- in and around the Negro residents in order to exclude as many of them as possibly can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.910" offset="4844001">Now, as Mr. Gray has pointed out, there has been no statement in the -- the purpose of the legislation other than the fact that we alleged in our complaint that the purpose of this legislation was discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.937" offset="4904187">Now, it's our position that as a result of the enactment of Act 140 that the petitioners and other Negroes similarly situated have been deprived the personal and private constitutional rights protected under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States that they have been -- did -- did not -- denied the right of municipal residence in the city and the benefits which are incident thereto and that they have to deny the right to vote in the municipal elections and we contend that they are to deny these rights solely because they are Negroes and for no other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.395" offset="5049950">Now, as the city has been redrawn, Tuskegee has become virtually a white city with Negroes denied the right to vote in the city and the right to live in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.506" offset="5098433">Now, we take the position, if the Court please, that it is quite obvious that Alabama could not pass the statute which would openly disenfranchise Negroes which would open the set of test for their right to vote in any election in any territory unit which was different from those applying to other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.214" offset="5185264">And if such a law were before the Court, there would be no question but that, this would be constitutionally impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.038" offset="5212536">And that if such a claim were made that this would be cognizable in the federal court and that there would be -- redress would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.897" offset="5247958">We also contend that if Alabama had passed the statute, which denied Negroes the right to live in Tuskegee or to any of the benefits which accrue to the citizens of Tuskegee, that this would be a denial of Fourteenth Amendment rights and that there would be no question that this kind of claim would have -- would be available for redress in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.899" offset="5343984">We further would like to point out to the Court on the basis of its decision that it would not matter whether this was done openly or covertly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.961" offset="5372197">The fact that it was done and this was the result, there would be a claim of constitutional deprivation which would be actionable before the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.438" offset="5410126">Now, our contention is that this is our case, that our case is -- is the same case as the cases which apply to the -- these kinds of discrimination -- discriminations and disenfranchising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.277" offset="5461535">We feel that this passage of Act 140 is -- has brought the case of racial discrimination as any case that has come before this Court between Yick Wo versus Hopkins and Cooper versus Aaron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.150" offset="5517019">We also contend that the -- the -- our allegations, the allegations of undisputed -- which are undisputed at this stage of the proceeding which the Court cited in its memorandum opinion in the District Court, that these allegations of rank discrimination cannot be cast aside or discounted by placing labels upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.651" offset="5599044">The labeling action one way or the other is -- so far as the state -- problem is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.027" offset="5620464">We think that the fact that the -- that the defendants rely upon the cases like Mount Pleasant versus Beckwith, which involves the plenary power of a -- of a State to redefine its borders or Colegrove -- Colegrove versus Green are not cases which apply to this -- to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.927" offset="5704056">We think that we -- that our situation is -- is based upon federal constitutional doctrine that the State cannot discriminate against persons because of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.054" offset="5752644">They can't discriminate against them in terms of the -- of the benefits that are -- are applicable in terms of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.362" offset="5777826">They can't discriminate against them in terms of their right to participate in elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.731" offset="5795276">And that where such claims are made that we have a -- a prima facie case which the federal courts can hear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.399" offset="5866015">And our problem is that in -- in the kinds of case that we have alleged, that it is the kind of case in which normally, we have been permitted in the -- and of the history of the -- of the kinds of racial discrimination cases which occur that there's been no question but this type of case is -- can go to court and that we have a right to a hearing on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.075" offset="6080742">We do -- we contend that Alabama may redraft its territorial limits but it cannot do it in order to accomplish a racially proscribed discrimination under the Constitution of the United States.</text>
