          <turn speaker="alexander_a_goldfarb" startTime="0.000" stopTime="410.688">
            <label>Mr. Alexander A. Goldfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- attention to page 24 of the respondent's brief in which he admits, State admits that petitioner was moderately defective and of a classification of middle or high grade moron.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.081" offset="139682">But more particularly, it's significant that the state police officers and the State concedes it's new or were told by the petitioner that he was feeble-minded on that day, Saturday, the first day that he took -- they took him into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.416" offset="185031">So that they knew that this was a mental defective from the very day they -- they took him into -- under their influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.410" offset="209063">And further, the State concedes at page 26 that the accused was subjected to extended time for questioning, on page 26 of the third paragraph of the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.741" offset="254307">So there is a concession by the State that there's been at least an extensive period of questioning although it related to other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.946" offset="287117">Now, on that Tuesday when the State had violated the mittimus and not taken the accused back to the Hartford -- back to the Hartford County Jail as directed by Court order, during that entire period, they subjected him to intermittent periods of questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.167" offset="360051">And two, when they brought him back to the State Police Barracks that afternoon or early evening, they brought his wife and two minor children, a thirteen-year-old child and a five-year-old child to State Police Headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.948" offset="407176">And as there -- as -- as the state police officer, Lieutenant Rome stated in the record, and this is admitted by the State, "Mr. McDonough interrogating -- cross interrogating Mr. -- Lieutenant Rome, you also testified yesterday, Mr. Rome, the reason you brought Mrs. Culombe to the Headquarters was to use her as another way of getting confession."</text>
            <text syncTime="94.993" offset="483349">Lieutenant Rome, "Yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="96.383" offset="488887">"And did you expect to use her on Taborsky too?"</text>
            <text syncTime="99.122" offset="499858">"If I could," he answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.016" offset="507486">"If you could, what other means or ways did you use on Taborsky?</text>
            <text syncTime="103.912" offset="518980">Did you use his mother?"</text>
            <text syncTime="105.514" offset="525458">Answer, "You could interpret it that way," and that was the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.424" offset="537057">They used his mother to get a confession from the co-suspect, Joseph Taborsky.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.122" offset="563911">Not only that and this is undisputed, the thirteen-year-old minor child had confessed to some private conversation held between her father and the co-suspect Taborsky in their home sometime previous, about a month or two previous.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.384" offset="624933">State Police used the confession of that minor child, had the minor thirteen-year-old minor child into disgusting and humiliating episode, confront her father with that very statement, the very confession that she made.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.988" offset="683342">And the essence of that statement is at page -- it's in the transcript in which the State does not deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.733" offset="746350">"You do recall," Mr. McDonough says recalling the thirteen or fourteen-year-old child over to the door and saying, "Honey, tell your father what you told us, don't you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="169.566" offset="781667">The answer of the -- of Lieutenant Rome, "I could have said that."</text>
            <text syncTime="187.248" offset="852407">In addition to the use of the wife and children, there was the five-year-old child who was also taken to the police headquarters and she was brought there because she was sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.887" offset="882918">And they claim -- the State claims that the mother didn't want to leave the five-year-old child alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.951" offset="899218">Nevertheless, the two children were brought to the police station with the mother against her will, Culombe knew this.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.055" offset="919594">Culombe knew also that -- that his five-year-old child was sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.161" offset="939969">This warred -- wore upon him, this depressed him, this demoralized him.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.970" offset="963271">And later on that evening or the following day, the five-year-old child had to be dispatched to a hospital from State Police Headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.650" offset="990020">There's no question about this fact because it had the mumps.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.574" offset="1013635">That was Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.828" offset="1018650">Now, the -- they finished questioning him until about 8:50 that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.009" offset="1035368">According to the State Police, he was a sorry sight after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.765" offset="1050415">"He had gone through an ordeal," said Sergeant Paige, an ordeal he was subjected through -- to.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.782" offset="1070477">He was a sorry sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.489" offset="1077373">The following day on Wednesday, Culombe was, again, illegally borrowed from the -- from the Hartford County Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.906" offset="1102973">He was sent back the previous evening to the jail, eight hours after the Court had directed he'd be sent for with -- forthwith to the jail the previous day.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.170" offset="1132022">On Wednesday, again, they illegally borrowed him from a Hartford County Jail and the trial judge so found specifically in the course of this trial that he was illegally borrowed so far as the removal from the jail was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.579" offset="1193671">And I refer -- respectfully refer Your Honors to page 952 of the record for that reference in which the trial judge found that he was illegally borrowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.676" offset="1226062">Having supported him from the Hartford County Jail, they took him and kept him in his custody until the confession was elicited from him early that -- later that evening or until the morning hours at 12:30 a.m. of Thursday the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.698" offset="1298160">He was intensively questioned from 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday until the early hours of Thursday morning when he finally signed the confession in which he did -- admitted being present at the time the robbery but denied any killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.621" offset="1349883">Now, the questioning period on Wednesday was about -- was -- was -- and there was an oral confession that Wednesday afternoon to which he had committed -- which he admitted practically the same thing that he did that Wednesday, that following Thursday morning in which four officers were present, O'Brien, Rome, Paige and Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.752" offset="1438386">He was questioned previous to that by Rome, Murphy and Paige for about an hour and a half that afternoon and for three hours while driving around on -- on Wednesday afternoon by O'Brien, Rome, Paige and Murphy where he gave his oral confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.578" offset="1497736">He was further questioned by Rome and Officer Remer and Kelly for an -- for half hour to an hour early that evening and for the rest of the evening, he was questioned by Rome, Paige, Matus, O'Brien for a period of four and a half to five hours until about 12:30 or 1 a.m. the following morning on Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.691" offset="1566177">Five days after he was taken into custody, he finally confessed, subjected to sustain the prolonged interrogation, illegal procedures by the police, delaying tactics by the police and presently before committee judge, use of the wife and the two -- and the two minor children in order to get a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.323" offset="1632632">And furthermore, the confession was not in the language of the accused who could neither write nor speak the -- neither read nor write the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.491" offset="1661367">It is totally in the language of Lieutenant Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.072" offset="1675682">Lieutenant Rome wouldn't ask him a question, Culombe would answer the question, he would paraphrase the answer, composed it in his own language, in his own syntax, in his own set of structure and we have here the Wednesday night confession, Exhibit Z1 for identification.</text>

          <turn speaker="alexander_a_goldfarb" startTime="453.502" stopTime="673.554">
            <label>Mr. Alexander A. Goldfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="453.502" offset="1917367">Exhibit Z1 for identification, Mr. Justice Whittaker, contained matters relating to other than the particular crimes involved in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.012" offset="1963447">Therefore, the State saw fit to exclude those matters and rewrite that confession and submit it to the accused on Monday 10 -- Monday, March 4th, after his trial counsel had -- after his -- the Court had already appointed his counsel and incorporated only in that Monday confession those matters which pertained exclusively to the New Britain matter, the New Britain crimes as in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.317" offset="2080684">They had excluded all other immaterial matters because as -- as the State says, it would be prejudicial to the accused to have admitted that entire confession pertaining to unrelated crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.430" offset="2133138">At the time the Monday confession was taken, however, and we submit and the -- and the evidence is undisputed, the Court on Thursday had appointed a special public defendant, the Superior Court, Mr. Attorney McDonough to represent him without notifying his court-appointed counsel, without advising him to be present, Lieutenant Rome and another officer -- four office -- another officer went to the Hartford County Jail and approached the accused and told him that -- and told him after the accused had asked them, "Where is my attorney?"</text>
            <text syncTime="544.445" offset="2281200">He says -- he reassured him to worst to the effect, "It was okayed by -- by your attorney," which was a misrepresentation of fact because his attorney was never even notified of this, was never advised that they intended to take this statement from him on that Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.405" offset="2349014">In fact, he -- the day previous, he had learned that they have taken the second confession from him on Sunday and he warned the police to remove him from the State Police Barracks and take him to the Hartford County Jail and then specifically instructed Lieutenant Rome to leave him alone and not to bother him.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.519" offset="2421426">And Lieutenant Rome admitted on the stand that he specifically and explicitly disregarded Attorney McDonough's, the court-appointed counsel's instructions, explicitly disregarded them because he felt he could do better without him, as he said -- and because he felt, as Lieutenant Rome said, he didn't think it was necessary to notify Attorney McDonough of his approaching the accused and asking him for -- for having him sign the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.827" offset="2526647">So I think clearly, this is the denial of counsel under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.427" offset="2545037">Certainly, he had a -- a right to counsel after Thursday when he was first accused of a crime, Thursday of that week in -- in a bench warrant which is issued against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.500" offset="2577324">He had a right to counsel after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.604" offset="2585788">The Court recognized it by appointing Attorney McDonough to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.335" offset="2596760">I'm not claiming that he had a right to counsel preliminary to Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.913" offset="2615045">Before that time, he lacked counsel, he requested it before that time before Thursday but he had a right to counsel because the Court had appointed him on Friday or Saturday of that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.265" offset="2656423">And by the police not notifying Attorney McDonough, and the State concedes they didn't notify him, the State concedes that -- that Attorney McDonough wasn't present at both times when the accused was -- when two or more confessions were elicited the accused, although I think as a matter of right, he was entitled to had his lawyer there at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.594" offset="2745762">As a matter of constitutional right, nevertheless, he wasn't present and particularly on Monday, they used the deceit comparable to the deceit of the Spano case to secure the confession from the mentally defective tractable accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.208" offset="5384234">I hope respectfully, I may be able to suggest to the Court why the respondent is not out in wet field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.110" offset="5431777">In 1957, in January and February, there were a lot atrocious killings in the Hartford area happening on weekends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.658" offset="5477961">Culombe and Taborsky became prime suspects in that continued investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.156" offset="5507950">And because of the atmosphere that was going on, on Saturday afternoon, February 23rd, 1957, because the state police feared to let another weekend go, they picked up Taborsky and Culombe as a -- as suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.716" offset="5590288">Now, when they picked them up, they sent two different state police groups of officers out to get each one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.518" offset="5621426">One group went to Taborsky's home where his mother lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.089" offset="5635741">Taborsky was living in Brooklyn by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.672" offset="5650056">They went to his mother's home and they met Taborsky coming out of his mother's house and getting into a car and who was in the car but Culombe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.070" offset="5687672">Now, this group of state police officers didn't know that the other group was out to get Culombe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.501" offset="5713377">So they said to Taborsky and Culombe, "Will you come down to the State Police Barracks, we want to talk with you," talking to Taborsky now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.017" offset="5755486">Taborsky said, "Okay."</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.208" offset="5764159">He got into the car with Culombe and Culombe followed this cruiser and they drove to the State Police Barracks about 2:30 Saturday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.913" offset="5803029">When they got to the State Police Barracks, Taborsky got out and went in and Culombe drove off, the police officers not knowing that Culombe was wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.871" offset="5846810">Culombe drove straight to his home which was a matter of a few minutes from the State Police Barracks, and when he got there, this other group of state police officers were at Culombe's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.760" offset="5894457">Now, when Culombe got out of his car, he went into the house and he went immediately to the bathroom and the officers could hear metallic noises in the bathroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.020" offset="5947434">Soon, he came out and they asked him to come to police headquarters which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.872" offset="5966869">Culombe's wife was present at that time and she knew that he went to the police station and as a matter of fact, one of the officers talked to her while Culombe was in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.663" offset="6018069">They went to the police station and when they got there, Taborsky already being there, the police asked him if they would go around the county to some adjoining towns so victims of some of these holdups that were still alive might view them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.357" offset="6152756">What I'm saying is with this incident, the State Police were right in their thinking that they couldn't let it go another weekend because Taborsky and Culombe had the guns in the car when they were picked up getting ready for another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.515" offset="6221406">That will come out when the confession is given.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.372" offset="6248887">Now, it is true that Taborsky had a -- a bag with him and in it was some whiskey and nobody knows how much was in the bag and nobody paid any attention to it and as a matter of fact, on the -- at the trial, the first time the officer in charge of that right around at the towns knew about the whiskeys when it came out in the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.559" offset="6353586">And they would've stopped them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.689" offset="6358079">One of the officers said he did see him but it's just an element that's in here but has nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.410" offset="6380962">He did have this bag and it had some whiskey in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.127" offset="6391829">How much?</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.659" offset="6394023">Nobody knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.290" offset="6400502">And when the police officers realized what they were doing with the bag, he had finished -- they had finished what was in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.584" offset="6425684">They never got drunk and nobody claims that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.838" offset="6438745">When they came back to the barracks that night after making this tour, in the State Police Barracks, one of the officers, Sergeant Paige and Sergeant Paige is the officer now who was talking mostly to Culombe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.879" offset="6494856">He was talking to Culombe about some guns, so Culombe said to him, "I'm a gun collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.054" offset="6519620">I have some guns at home."</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.633" offset="6529860">So they went back to Culombe's house about 8 o'clock that Saturday night and found, I think, eight guns, some boxes of ammunition and three bandanas which they took back to the barracks and brought Culombe back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.769" offset="6590464">Now, Mrs. Culombe again was home at that time.When they got back to the barracks about 10 o'clock that night, Lieutenant Rome placed Culombe and Taborsky both under arrest under our statute that you can arrest without a warrant on suspicion of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.938" offset="6667160">It is true that the logbook of the state police department made no record, written record of it but that logbook is simply a logbook that the department keeps, it's not the booking book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.211" offset="6708224">Where there is a -- an organized police department in the county or State of Connecticut, the State Police, when they make the formal arrest, booked him in the town where the organized police department is and where the crime occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.724" offset="6766320">So, Saturday night, I don't say that he wasn't questioned, he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.010" offset="6783457">After they got the guns from the home and came back, he was asked some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.635" offset="6801951">The record isn't clear how long but the questioning was fair questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.549" offset="6821595">There is no evidence whatsoever of any abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.888" offset="6834970">He went to bed at about midnight on Saturday night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.115" offset="6851793">He was fed, he got slept, there was no problem of -- of denying him of anything and the next day on Sunday, I think it started some time in the afternoon, they asked him some more questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.091" offset="11775770">So he went back to the State Police Barracks and that night, sent a policewoman, a nurse -- a state policewoman to pick up Mrs. Culombe and they brought her down to the station and she confronted her husband and said something to him about, "How did you get in to this thing?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.152" offset="11856018">And in the course of this, he became upset and she was upset.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.393" offset="12240959">Now, I say that's an indication that the State Police here were sure carrying out extended interrogation in a matter that was of some importance to our State but they did not do anything improper with regard to their rights of that man because right then and there where he was upset after talking to his wife, if they put the pressure on, they could -- and after a coerced confession, they could've got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.871" offset="12350882">Now, they picked him up from the jail and they say, borrowed him the next day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.800" offset="12510542">The first time he came into the case and in talking to him after about an hour and they were going over this list of crimes and saying, "To you, Arthur, were you there?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.131" offset="12555891">And they said to him, "If you -- if you were there, you're -- than rather to lie about it, say you don't want to talk about it but they would take this list of crimes of all these crimes I spoke about and go down the list."</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.606" offset="12617749">A few minutes after they started talking to him, I think about an hour, he said, "I'll tell you where the guns are."</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.100" offset="12671770">They got Lieutenant Rome, there was Detective Murphy, Sergeant Paige and they took another officer, Detective O'Brien who was a stenographer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.160" offset="12752018">Now, mind you, this man was a canny, experienced criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.569" offset="12865599">And just when they started, and Culombe only lives a few minutes from the State Police Headquarters, they had only gone a few blocks down the street in front of our courthouse in Hartford when Culombe in the backseat with Lieutenant O'brien started to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.648" offset="12925994">Excuse me, with Lieutenant Rome, started to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.205" offset="12940204">They stopped the car, Detective Murphy got into the driver side and took the wheel and started on O'Brien, the stenographer, got on to the passenger side and started taking down in shorthand what Culombe said.</text>

            <text syncTime="4071.207" offset="16388159">And at that time, the Superior Court judge advised him of his rights, and this is all in the record, of his right to counsel and this is where the questioning came up about the public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.579" offset="16445733">Both of them, Taborsky and Culombe said they wanted to choose their own counsel and they asked for some lawyers by name.</text>

            <text syncTime="4100.001" offset="16503411">They were advised that they didn't have to say anything, that they could remain silent and that counsel would get in touch with them as soon as the Court could get -- get one that would take the case, particularly, the ones they asked for in this instance, attorney McDonough.</text>

            <text syncTime="4203.281" offset="16916459">They simply were to -- reexamined him for purposes of determining his mental capacity, that's in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="4219.080" offset="16979675">This is what I call a second confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.892" offset="16990960">You'll recall this first confession, Exhibit Z1 for identification was when he said he didn't commit the murders, Taborsky shot both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.289" offset="17020531">And by the way, in all of his confessions, he kept using the name Taborsky.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.822" offset="17042683">He kept putting the blame on Taborsky.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.050" offset="17051564">That's what he was trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.513" offset="17065462">Taborsky, on the other hand, when he confessed, never mentioned Culombe by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.323" offset="17080613">All he said was the other guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.830" offset="17090644">But Culombe kept mentioning Taborsky's name and this is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.696" offset="17110183">At the trial, Taborsky's counsel, this is a joint trial now, Taborsky's counsel said, "I object to that confession because Culombe's confession keeps on naming Taborsky and the State said, "We'll cut out the name."</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.730" offset="17170265">And Culombe's own lawyer got up and objected to taking the name of Taborsky out of Culombe's confession because he was trying at that trial to show that Taborsky was to blame for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.675" offset="17218121">Now, this is in front of the -- without the absence of the jury on the objection but that's exactly what happened and I had made reference to that in my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4303.171" offset="17316028">From Wednesday night or early Thursday morning, 12:30 a.m. on Thursday morning, he wasn't questioned at all with reference to New Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.733" offset="17354271">He was in his cell on Saturday night at the State Police Barracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.076" offset="17371721">And at 6 o'clock, a strange police officer by the name of Officer Biersch (ph) came into the cellblock and said to -- to Culombe, "Hello Culombe, I'm going to be here to guard you."</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.739" offset="17422294">And he went down to the end of the cellblock and sat down on a chair and started to read a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.496" offset="17441311">That's the extent of the conversation that officer had with Culombe, 6 o'clock at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.930" offset="17467120">And this is a part of this case if the counsel for the petitioner's gloss is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.063" offset="17495646">A few -- at 10 o'clock that night, four hours after this officer was there and said nothing to Culombe other than hello, Culombe called the officer to his cell and he said to him, "I got something on my conscience, I want to tell you what happened in New Britain."</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.724" offset="17566281">Now mind you, after he had counsel, after he had been advised by his counsel and had been told not to sign or say anything, this is that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.207" offset="17612152">He called his officer over at 10 o'clock and said, "There's something on my conscience is bothering me, I want to tell you about it."</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.418" offset="17637021">And he gave the confession which is Exhibit EE where he said he is the one who killed this gas station attendant himself and not Taborsky.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.257" offset="17672443">Now, I say to you, this second confession goes back to the original confession because this is the kind of evidence that you find out to determine whether that first confession was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.524" offset="17725419">This is a good indication that that first confession was voluntary because here he is after he has been advised by his counsel and told by his counsel not to do or say anything, he go voluntarily to a strange police officer, confesses again.</text>

            <text syncTime="4668.801" offset="18778572">Now, one other thing if I might, well, I think of it just before I quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.482" offset="18797275">I think, Justice Whittaker, you asked something about the -- the wording of this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.616" offset="18817860">And in his reply brief and in his argument he had said, "Where the State when it's prepared by the phrases of the police officers and put together that you can supply an intent."</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.435" offset="18869164">In this case, the intent doesn't mean a thing because this is a felony murder, so that that argument about the police department supplying some intent in the wording of that confession, doesn't amount to anything because in this case, the intent is there because it's a felony murder, you don't have to show premeditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.672" offset="18954010">You don't have to show any intent to get first degree murder out of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.015" offset="18975431">So when he makes this argument about the phrasing of this confession, it doesn't apply to a felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.971" offset="19003225">Under our statute, if the murder is perpetrated in the commission of a felony, it's automatically first degree murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="4743.145" offset="19075950">Here's the man when he got -- we had a long hearing on the admission of the confessions without the -- without the jury, and he called the witnesses and took the stand himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.396" offset="19120985">Now, I say, this is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.933" offset="19131120">When he took the stand, he told about the things that are supposed to happen to him and a good deal of the testimony relied upon by the petitioner here is his own even though he claims on the other hand that he's a moron.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.310" offset="19176573">He likes to take his testimony but he claims he's a moron on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.051" offset="19195591">In any event, before the jury, after they come back, after the confessions were admitted under the Connecticut procedure, he didn't take the stand before the jury nor did he call any witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.080" offset="19243656">In fact, every time that he -- the State's witnesses were cross-examined, we have to go through the procedure twice by putting in the evidence relating to the confessions, all he showed at that time again, riding two horses, cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.786" offset="19298513">He was trying to get that jury to give him life.</text>
