            <text syncTime="1508.797" offset="6138546">He said, yes, that's -- that's the gun that I killed him with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.701" offset="6158190">His -- his statement was reduced to writing at that time after the -- after he was advised as I mentioned on page 38 and on page 63 that any statement he used, he said, might be used against him in court and that he had a right to an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.260" offset="6268426">Now, that -- that's the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.390" offset="6292982">Although I -- I feel that's not a -- it's not a -- a part of this, certainly not a part of this because it -- it was not properly raised in the trial court, but if it was, there was no -- no constitutional violation under any of the rulings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.673" offset="6410115">So, that and the other two, he has made the point in -- in question two there that unknown to him, the -- there was a relative of the state prosecutor on the jury and that two jurymen were biased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.174" offset="6508022">Now about all I can say to that is that the -- he mentioned in his brief the -- the conduct of the trial court in -- in discussing there, in ruling on it, the trial court heard the motion for new trial, he had it filed October the 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.083" offset="6607705">It was heard or to be heard December the 25th, 1958, some more than two months after the filing of the motion, plenty of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.352" offset="6656815">He, at that time, allowed at the request of the State and the accused additional time until January the 5th -- 25th, 1959 to get up evidence of any bias on the -- on the jury and also anything else that he might have or that we might have concerning his bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.036" offset="6783561">And in all of the motion for new trial, there were affidavits concerning the relation and there were affidavits concerning his contentions on the bias and those affidavits in -- in his question four, were not sent to the Supreme Court of Georgia, simply because he didn't specify in his bill of exceptions, which is a requirement of the Georgia procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.480" offset="6901321">And I might mention here that under the Georgia procedure, the Supreme Court of Georgia cannot hear or consider any evidence that is not or any part of the record that is not approved by the trial court and that is the reason that Supreme Court of Georgia did not order this record up as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.837" offset="7006751">It ordered any approved record of this trial -- of this hearing on January 25th, 1959.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.726" offset="7182294">But, I mentioned these questions two and four which are raised, not that they have any -- any constitutional value, I don't think the appellant has the right to get into this code on -- on a due process question concerning this code section and -- and then use a scatter gun to try to hit anything in the record that might -- that might have been technically incorrect, which these things were not and I'm -- I'm mentioning those not because they have any importance before this Court, but to show that they were technically correct and I think just a quick glance at the opinion of the Supreme Court of Georgia will show that those were technically correct under the Georgia procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.883" offset="7402872">Certainly, there was not at any stage, any constitutional question raised on those two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.229" offset="7448325">There was not any constitutional question raised on the confession properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.117" offset="7479881">As a matter of fact, before the Supreme Court of Georgia and in the brief or in the amended motion for new trial, I'm -- I'm looking at page 11 of the amended motion for new trial which was considered by the Court and which the trial court and which was sent to the Georgia Supreme Court and here is the -- here is his contention on that to show the Court here that -- that there was no constitutional question made there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.643" offset="7629928">He states that the confession was procured prior to the time of the grand jury indictment before any warrant had issue, that the confession was obtained at that time when defendant was being held in jail without any legal or formal charge and further contends, the confession obtained while defendant was being held illegally and his right of counsel and the formal charge before a competent officer were being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.932" offset="7743091">That therefore, made the confession void and that is -- that is the only -- the only thing that this Court would have to go on to -- to show that there was any constitutional issue raised, that the confession was void, certainly, not a -- not a sufficient allegation or a sufficient foundation under the prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.236" offset="7876315">The Supreme Court of Georgia however, gave him the benefit of that and considered his argument on it, did not as they could have ruled that point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.654" offset="7921977">They -- in their opinion, cited the McNabb, the Mallory and the Stein cases and even -- even went ahead and considered his constitutional argument though -- though there was no basis for it in the record as I say here that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.113" offset="8039842">That -- that feature even if this Court decided to -- to consider the constitutional aspect of this confession would be controlled by the Stein case, that is cited in our brief and in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Georgia, which holds it that even if there had been an illegal detention that -- that alone is not enough to render the confession illegal or render it coerced, either psychological or mental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.967" offset="8243284">Back in the remaining moments to the Court I have stated, I feel is the only constitutional question here and that is the constitutionality of code section 38-415.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.482" offset="8321337">As was mentioned earlier, that is -- is merely a continuation of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.433" offset="8381106">Powell versus State of Alabama, which is cited in the brief, 287 U.S. 45, which is apparently, is relied on quite strongly by the appellant, the Court in that case, laid down the rule which had been mentioned by Mr. Justice Frankfurter yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.724" offset="8486222">One test that is -- which has been applied to determine whether due process of law has been accorded in any given instances, is to ascertain what were the settled usages and modes of proceeding under the common statute law of England, before the Declaration of Independence, subject however, to the qualification that they be shown not to have been unsuited to the civil and political conditions of our ancestors, by having been followed in this country after it became a nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.237" offset="8620283">The Court -- this Court said that plainly that test had not been met in the Powell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.389" offset="8664900">That was that involved the -- the denial of the right to counsel by failing to effectually appoint an attorney before the day of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.827" offset="8726653">And the Court held that that -- that was a denial of the right to counsel and in that, they made a statement -- this Court made the statement that my brother has seized upon to -- to hang his head on in this case and that is that the -- the accused is entitled to the guiding hand of counsel at every step of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.339" offset="8864684">Certainly, that would not mean that he was entitled to hold his hand all, during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.405" offset="8889031">The guiding hand of counsel at every proper step on that trial was merely meant that they were entitled to counsel in time to prepare properly for the case and that if he didn't have the counsel at that stage, he was effectively denied of that counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.140" offset="8979937">And this Court said that the failure to give them reasonable time to prepare was a clear denial of due process, certainly not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.897" offset="9046915">The Stein case certainly points up what I have said before and that is that it -- certainly he was not denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.841" offset="9130715">The Court said in the Stein case, now that it was particularly applicable to this case, where -- where here on the trial of the case and this is the meat and the only point in this appeal and that is, was this accused denied due process by the trial court and in effect, does code section 38-415 deny him of due -- the right to due process or deny him due process of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.682" offset="9290062">That's the -- that's the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.348" offset="9296750">Here's what he did in order to invoke his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.704" offset="9314200">He put the accused on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.305" offset="9324544">He said, "What is your name?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.797" offset="9342516">And he said, "Have you murdered anybody?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.827" offset="9358712">And at that point, he was stopped and the court and I -- I would like for this Court to particularly note that the court stated there, I must rule that you do not --</text>

            <text syncTime="2384.493" offset="9641357">The code section and its interpretation does not, this Court did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.318" offset="9676675">As the Court said in the Stein case, when they -- they had the counsel for the accused was complaining that if they had put the accused up on the stand to -- to try to rebut the presumption concerning the admission of a confession and to take the stand and show that that confession was coerced, they -- they argued that the New York practice would've allow them to be cross-examined and that they were denied due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.026" offset="9847515">And the Court, this Court answered that argument this way and it's -- it's particularly appropriate for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.833" offset="9878653">At page 175 of the Stein case Stein versus New York 346 U.S. 156, the Court said, "We will not adjudge a trial court guilty of constructive abuse by imputing to it a ruling that never was made on a proposition that never was put to it" and that's the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.720" offset="9990248">This Court would have to find that the -- the Court had made a -- would've made a certain ruling on a proposition that never was put to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.503" offset="10045419">So he has never invoked the full benefit of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.457" offset="10085230">Certainly, it does not, under any of the decisions of this Court, deny him due process under the -- it does not as stated in the Powell case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4269.203" offset="17180191">However, it is discretionary with the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.572" offset="17197641">So it was not raised for the first time in my brief, it was raised by the Supreme Court of Georgia in their ruling in the constitutionality of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.838" offset="17230764">Because that is the only case that they cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.760" offset="17242363">They cite no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.391" offset="17252916">Now, we submit therefore, to interpret this code section to be discretionary with the trial judge would absolutely be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.824" offset="17298683">And it would deny the equal protection of the laws that are given to some criminals in Georgia and denied to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.478" offset="17337240">And as this Court held on page 8 of my brief, I set forth in Missouri versus Lewis, "Equal protection of the laws means no person shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons in the same place and under like certain circumstances."</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.185" offset="17412159">Also this Honorable Court held in Griffin versus the People of the State of Illinois, in 351 U.S. 12, where it was said, constitutional guarantees of this clause and equal protection, both call for procedures in criminal trials which allow no invidious discrimination between persons or different groups of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.903" offset="17502960">Both equal protection and this clause emphasize the central aim of judicial system that all people charged with crime must stand on an equality before the bar of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.991" offset="17555310">That is my contention that not only does it deny him the right of counsel, but to say that the discretion -- it is discretionary where the trial judge is certainly not equal protection of the law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul James Maxwell</label>
            <text syncTime="5069.907" offset="20383013">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.201" offset="20384162">It's up to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.585" offset="20389700">Judge can say, yes, you can help this client and the other lawyer, you can't help that client.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.192" offset="20408090">And that to me would be entirely discretionary and discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.215" offset="20436198">Also I said yesterday, I certainly would far rather for the sake of the State and for the sake of the defendant to have the thing that he is just like it is in federal court or any other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.938" offset="20483114">That would be the far better way to get to real justice would be held like every other state has it and like the federal court has it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.620" offset="20517804">But that will be something the legislature would have to enact at and I think they would do it immediately if anything has ever happened to code section 38-415, because even a trial judge here, it says no matter however logical they all feel that way about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.113" offset="20583842">It would be much better.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.287" offset="20592515">Thank you very much.</text>
