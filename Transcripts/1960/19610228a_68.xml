            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="16.845" offset="170715">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.187" offset="180120">The question in this case is whether predicated exclusively upon a finding that the employment of workers is based upon a discriminatory hiring procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.036" offset="239470">The Board may require the refund to those workers of the union dues and fees they pay to the unions which represented them and of which they are members.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.063" offset="295581">The refund order may, as in this case, run against the unions alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.067" offset="319613">It may, as in the preceding case and the case which follows, run against the employer and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.799" offset="350542">It may, as in other cases, run against the employer alone, whether it runs against the union alone, the employer alone or both together, depends upon the fortuity whether the person filing the unfair labor charge has filed it against the union alone, the employer alone or both together.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.539" offset="445524">In all these cases, we deal with unions which are freely chosen by the employees to represent them in collective bargains.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.511" offset="489409">It is unquestioned and unquestionable that the Teamsters Union, the Carpenters Union, the Typographical Union are the rightful representatives of the employees for whom they act and to whom the dues and fees were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.747" offset="562343">Now, the question in this case arises in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.783" offset="582510">The United Brotherhood of Carpenters, the International Union, has an agreement with an employer called Mechanical Handling Systems by which the employer agrees to work the hours, pay the wages and abide by the rules and regulations established by the local union of the carpenters and employ members of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.147" offset="687940">This employer, Mechanical Handling Systems, started a construction job on the premises of the Ford Motor Company in Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.884" offset="726915">A few days after the job was started, the business representative of the district council came to the job and met with the superintendent of the Company on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.799" offset="774562">They agreed that the wages, hours and other working conditions on that job were to be governed by an agreement between the local construction association, the local employer construction association and the district council.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.625" offset="837883">They also agreed that the millwrights and carpenters that the employer would need on the job would be obtained by referral from either the district council or Local 60, which is a constituent local of the district council.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.571" offset="905697">Now, by the rules of the district council and Local 60, referral was restricted to union members, nonmembers would not be referred on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.827" offset="946657">In practice, the millwrights and carpenters working on this job were restricted to those who were union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.821" offset="978631">There were two applicants for employment who came to this job seeking work.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.837" offset="998693">They were members of a local union of the carpenters in Louisville, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.547" offset="1017605">They travelled to Indianapolis, they applied for work at the job, they were denied work because they could not get a working permit from the district council and they could not get a working permit from the district council because unemployment in the Indianapolis area was widespread and the union's policy was not to refer persons from out of the area, if there were unemployment within the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.902" offset="1127006">Now, the Board found that the union and the employer were operating under a closed-shop preferential hiring system and this was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.458" offset="1217181">We do not contest that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.966" offset="1191267">The Board also found that the two applicants for employment were discriminatorily denied work.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.526" offset="1229511">The Board ordered the unions to cease and desist from this activity including execution of such agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.640" offset="1289906">We do not contest that part of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.872" offset="1270888">The Board ordered that the two workers who were denied employment are to be made whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.791" offset="1302549">But the Board went further and said that the unions were to return to the employees who have worked on the job, all the union dues and fees they had paid beginning with a period of six months preceding the filing of the unfair labor practice charge, it is that part of the order which is an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.289" offset="1392515">Now, the Board supports this kind of a refund order on two theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.137" offset="1423966">Both are essential to its reason for imposing a refund order.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.076" offset="1455626">The first is what I think we can call the notion of inevitable coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.622" offset="1477883">Now, I think it can be fairly paraphrased in these sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.969" offset="1495228">Given a discriminatory hiring procedure, employees are inevitably coerced to pay moneys to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.732" offset="1534307">The existence of an unlawful contract is sufficient in and of itself to establish the element of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.607" offset="1573804">The refund remedy is, therefore, without more applicable to all closed-shop and exclusive hiring agreements, whether or not proof of actual exaction of payments is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.829" offset="1630647">The only operative fact in the Board's thinking is a finding of a discriminatory hiring procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.959" offset="1663248">I think I can show -- I shall try to show in a moment that this is the rationalization for the order, that the real reason for the order is something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.058" offset="1707656">The real reason, I think, was expressed by the Board in these words, “We believe that a mere cease and desist order will have little impact in an industry where illegal hiring practices are widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.053" offset="1775574">The reimbursement order more properly effectuates the purposes of the Act because it provides not only a deterrent to future violations, but an incentive to future compliance."</text>
            <text syncTime="433.162" offset="1835969">In our view, the heart of the refund remedy, as currently used, is to coerced compliance with the Board's conception of a valid hiring agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.980" offset="1883303">Let's begin with the notion of inevitable coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.822" offset="1902634">I think the Board's argument can be reduced to two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.698" offset="1922173">Men on the job must be union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.020" offset="1939414">Therefore, men on the job were forced to join the union against their will.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.161" offset="1968044">This is like saying that men who practice law must have LL.B. degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.366" offset="1996884">Therefore, men who practice law went to law school against their will.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.494" offset="2017364">Now, the fallacy is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.954" offset="2027186">The premise is simply inadequate to support the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.856" offset="2046830">The conclusion states, but the premise does not establish that the only reason employees join unions is to escape the discrimination presumably exercised by unions against nonmembers.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.026" offset="2111509">Now, most of us have thought that the reason that employees join unions is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.662" offset="2142020">Most of us have thought that the reason was properly identified in the preamble to the statute, stating the policy of the statute, in which the condition which the statute identifies as the reason for union membership, is the inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.069" offset="2267617">And the policy continues that the statute is designed to promote union organization and collective bargaining for the purpose of restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.402" offset="2324982">And what the statute identifies as the reason for union membership was given expression by this Court almost 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.705" offset="2358209">And at that time, this Court was stating what was already been a commonplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.511" offset="2377435">Labor unions were organized out of the necessities of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.552" offset="2397602">A single employee was helpless in dealing with an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.224" offset="2416306">Union was essential to give laborers opportunity to deal on equality with their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.487" offset="2445354">Now, if it is true, as I think it demonstrably is, that people join unions in order to have the strength that comes from group action.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.311" offset="2484642">It is also demonstrably true that they pay and willingly pay union dues and fees to the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.293" offset="2516511">Everyone knows and employees know that no organization can exist without money.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.521" offset="2545455">If you want a union, you have to have dues in order to run a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.048" offset="2563532">And what everybody knows was proven beyond cavil during the four-year period between 1947 and 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.696" offset="2602193">During that time, there was a provision in the Taft-Hartley Act which stated that before an employer and a union could validly enter into a union shop agreement, there must first be an election among the employees at which the employees were to decide whether or not, they wish to authorize the union to enter into a union shop agreement, an agreement which would obligate the employees to pay union dues and fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.229" offset="2720266">During this period, the provision was repealed 1952, during this period, 46,119 elections were conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.690" offset="2770108">In 44,795 of them or 97% of the cases, the employees authorized unions to enter into union shop agreements obligating the payment of dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.143" offset="2823920">In those elections, about 5,300,000 employees were polled, 4,800,000 of them or 91.5% authorized the union to negotiate union shop agreements obligating the payment of dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.163" offset="2896018">So it seems to us that the premise upon which the Board starts, that union dues and fees are involuntarily paid, unwillingly paid, is in defiance of what everybody in this field knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.776" offset="2958503">And it's a particularly odd assumption when it is entertained, as in this case, in the building and construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.304" offset="2996537">Because if the building and construction industry is and has been highly unionized for a long time, in 1927, well before the Wagner Act either, a careful study in this field stated that in many large cities, the building construction workers are, for all practical purposes, completely organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.668" offset="3102072">In other cities, their claim to an organized strength varying from 60% to nearly 100% of building workers cannot seriously be disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.240" offset="3156302">In 1958, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 2.6 million workers in the building and construction industry, 2.3 million of them were union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.346" offset="3200711">And yet we have in this case, a refund order predicative on the notion that the workers on this job were inevitably coerced into paying dues to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.188" offset="3260165">Interestingly, what the Board disregards, Congress in 1959 recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.227" offset="3288273">In 1959, Congress enacted Section 8 (f) which in the building and construction field validated what we call a pre-hire agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.122" offset="3335816">A pre-hire agreement is one which authorizes an employer and a union to enter into an agreement, covering employment on a particular job, before any employees are hired for work upon that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.681" offset="3406137">Absent 8 (f), it has been the Board's view and is the Board's view, that you cannot validly enter into a collective bargaining agreement before a representative number of employees have been hired, because in the absence of a representative number of employees, you cannot know whether a majority within the unit choose union representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.354" offset="3492760">This rule was eliminated by Congress in Section 8 (f) and one of the important reasons supporting the elimination was recognition that in this industry, there was no question but that the people working on construction jobs would be union men who had chosen the union to represent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.454" offset="3573217">The Senate Report put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.748" offset="3582412">A substantial majority of the skilled employees in this industry constitute a pool of help centered about their appropriate craft union.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.853" offset="3626820">If the employer relies upon this pool of skilled craftsmen, members of the union, there is no doubt under these circumstances that the union will, in fact, represent a majority of the employees eventually hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.888" offset="3690872">Now, what is there in this case to suggest that the employees on this job were not part of this long standing voluntary tradition of union membership in the building and construction field?</text>
            <text syncTime="911.523" offset="3749491">And the answer is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.421" offset="3761089">All these employees were members of the union before they began working on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.964" offset="3787212">There is no evidence that a single one of them joined for the purpose of seeking or securing work on this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.578" offset="3821693">For the all the Board knows or cares, they could all have been union members, members of the Carpenters Union, for every single day of their working life.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.260" offset="3872371">The Board says, "Well, even assuming that they weren't -- they were all voluntary union members when the job began, they couldn't leave the union during the period that the job was going on and still continue to work on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.507" offset="3933393">And so their continuance in the membership was coerced and hence, their payment of union dues and fees is coerced."</text>
            <text syncTime="965.545" offset="3965576">Now, this is a pretty silly argument because it requires us to believe that if there hadn't been a closed-shop agreement on this job, these employees after they began working on the job would've all left the union for the period of this job and would've all ceased paying dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.467" offset="4037256">Well, as I say, this is silly.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.338" offset="4044675">People in the building and construction industry are union members by tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.365" offset="4064841">What is unthinkable to them is leaving the union, not being coerced into the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.864" offset="4090859">The conception that a closed-shop agreement coerces employees in the building and construction trade is simply not responsive to what employees in this industry themselves feel for they regard a system of employment based on union membership as a service to them, not coercive of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.070" offset="4167659">It seems to us fair to say, that if we are talking about exaction of payments in any realistic sense, the Board is simply without -- the beginning of a solid foundation upon which to predicate an argument that the fees and dues were unwillingly paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.984" offset="4251355">And that the fees and dues were not -- if the employees were not coerced in paying them, there is obviously no basis for requiring a return of moneys which were voluntarily paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.290" offset="4300570">I think it is fair to say what the Board has itself said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.519" offset="4317497">It doesn't really care about exaction of payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.171" offset="4336097">It imposes this remedy as it says whether or not proof of actual exaction of payments is established.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.612" offset="4377788">They will not allow a proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.919" offset="4383013">They have, in more than one case, rejected an offer of proof by which the union proposed to show that each of the employees paid union dues and fees willingly and that the payment was unrelated to the hiring procedure found by the Board to be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.966" offset="4455215">The Board said, “We are indifferent to that offer of proof, given the discriminatory hiring procedure that is all we care about."</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.869" offset="4502862">Now, if one reads the Board's decisions in this field and if one knew nothing about labor unions and how they work, one would not have the least idea that union dues and fees do not repost in depositories accumulating compound interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.128" offset="4587917">If one came down from Mars and read the Board's decisions, one wouldn't have the least idea that dues and fees go to pay the cost of negotiating agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.016" offset="4643401">They go to pay for lawyers, economists, actuaries and other professional personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.608" offset="4669837">They go towards maintaining a staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.405" offset="4681017">They go towards paying intra-union benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.828" offset="4694706">If you read the Board's decisions, you would not know that this was a factor which existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.950" offset="4715186">The Board requires the refund of union dues and fees utterly and different to the fact that those fees and dues paid for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.245" offset="4756355">Now, it is not enough to say that the Board would give these employees the benefit of union representation which we -- without requiring a contribution to defrayal of the expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.480" offset="4805256">It goes beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.478" offset="4813302">Because if it is true, as it is, that the fees go towards payment of the expenses for services, the moneys have been spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.937" offset="4859068">If you require a refund of moneys, where do you get them?</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.203" offset="4876204">Money has to come from somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.581" offset="4885713">So what reimbursement really comes down to at least and so far as unions are concerned, is that the employees on this job will have the benefits they receive from union representation paid for by the fees and dues paid by employees on other jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.454" offset="4957184">We find it hard to believe that this effectuates any policy of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.972" offset="4983306">We find it hard to believe that draining the union's treasury and to the extent of the drain, detracting from its capacity to function in collective bargaining, in adjustment of grievances, in administering intra-union benefit programs, effectuates any policy of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.519" offset="5069406">Now, we have to assume, I think, that the Board must know all of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.154" offset="5100022">It must know that you -- people join unions because they need the bargaining power that come from unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.462" offset="5129174">It must know that services are gotten from union dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.129" offset="5147878">It must know that union dues and fees, once they are spent that you require them refunded, have to come from the coffers of other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.059" offset="5191659">What then if it knows all these is the actual reason for this refund remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.431" offset="5217050">And the actual reason, it seems to me, is what I have quoted before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.817" offset="5234604">This is an in terrorem device by which the Board would compel unions and employers to acquiesce in its version of what constitutes a valid hiring agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.614" offset="5293850">The thing which makes this an in terrorem device, which makes it coercive, is the staggering financial liability which is entailed in such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.752" offset="5338363">In the employer's brief in the next case, on page 3, we are told, "The potential liability of this respondent under the Board's order now exceeds $350,000 and it's growing at the rate of close to $7000 as each month passes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.931" offset="5423104">This already staggering liability is fantastically multiplied where a union is a party to a multi-employer agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.452" offset="5465213">For the Board tells us this when a union is a party to a multi-employer agreement in cases involving multi-employer contracts, in which the contracting union and one or more employers are named respondent parties to the contract, the union's liability for reimbursement of sums unlawfully exacted, all social extend to all the employees covered under such contract found unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.456" offset="5597184">So that if the union should be administering a multi-employer contract of 10 employers or 100 employers, according to the Board, it should read from the dues and fees paid by the employees, working for those 10 employers or 100 employers, based exclusively upon a finding that the Board find something in this agreement which constitutes it says a discriminatory hiring procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.208" offset="5700211">Now, we can trace the actual purpose and the actual use to which this remedy has been put in relationship to the history of a preceding case, Number 85, the hiring hall case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.865" offset="5758830">The Board's refund remedy in its current posture was enunciated in the case called Brown-Olds and that's the name by which this remedy now goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.761" offset="5810448">That case came down in February of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.555" offset="5837615">About two years later, the General Counsel, the then General Counsel of the Board, sent an open letter to employers and unions in the building and construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.599" offset="5881814">He said to them, "You have three months within which to collect -- in which to correct your hiring agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.934" offset="5919117">If you correct them within the three months, we will not impose this refund remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.274" offset="5944508">If you do not correct them within these three months, we will impose this remedy."</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.102" offset="6059760">That is the case in which for the Board for the first time said that in order to validate an exclusive referral system of employment, you have to incorporate into the agreement, these three magic requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.164" offset="6116080">Three weeks later, the Board -- the General Counsel of the Board sends another letter, open letter to the employers and unions in the building and construction trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.773" offset="6150457">He says, “Well, now, you know that the Board has decided Mountain Pacific Chapter and you know you have to include in your agreements these three requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.925" offset="6187029">To give you a chance to negotiate into your agreements these three requirements, I will extend the deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.259" offset="6216391">I will give you now until September 1st, 1958 to fix up your agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.885" offset="6270934">Then the last open letter was sent by the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.485" offset="6285354">This time on August 19th, 1958, in which he said, “I'm not going to extend this deadline any further except to this extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.385" offset="9076903">The basis for a refund remedy in a company-dominated union situation was that the employees unwillingly pay their moneys to the company-dominated union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.490" offset="9125282">When such a finding can be made in the case of the kind that we have here, which is typical of these kinds of cases, then one can make a finding on a record that will stand that the dues and fees were -- willingly paid, then the remedy that was appropriate in the company-dominated union situation, would be appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.502" offset="9209396">But until one can equate the two, until one can say that dues and fees paid under a closed-shop agreement to a company-dominated union are the same as dues and fees paid by employees to freely chosen unions, there is no parallel between the two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.545" offset="9277524">I would like to mention this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.490" offset="9293302">The notion that the Board should not be impotent, assuming that its present remedies make it so, is something that ought to be, it seems to us, addressed to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.588" offset="9333739">The Board ought to go to Congress and say, "Cease and desist orders and make whole orders are just not enough."</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.693" offset="9358190">We ought to be able to fine employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.589" offset="9369684">These things ought to be made criminal for violations of criminal laws, so we can put some people into jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.756" offset="9406360">The remedial scheme under this Act is just that, remedial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.144" offset="9423914">The only justification for reimbursement orders under this statute is to make somebody whole, to give him back that which was wrongfully taken from him, unless that precondition can be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.888" offset="9482951">Unless a finding on substantial evidence can be made that something was taken from another which he would not have given up but for the unfair labor practice, there is no basis within the limitations of this remedial scheme for a reimbursement order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.975" offset="9547316">As Judge Goodrich put to the Third Circuit, "Imposition of fines or jail sentences upon employers and unions would also be a deterrent so far as such sanctions can act as a deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.515" offset="9601442">But a fine is clearer than the imposition of a penalty and the Labor Board is not authorized to impose penalties."</text>
