            <text syncTime="1859.782" offset="7543495">Now, the court -- both courts below answered that question in the negative, said that it is not the business of the federal courts to entertain and resolve the controversy, the dispute, which is created by these allegations, which are purposes of this review, I can take this is true.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.093" offset="7720814">As the opinions below demonstrate, this case has received in most careful and thoughtful consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.788" offset="7747563">And the decision below is based essentially upon three grounds, one, as to the nature of the statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.492" offset="7774312">This was a statute which defined municipal boundaries and at such a statute, under the decisions of this Court in three cases, such statute may be enacted by a state legislature wholly unrestrained by the provisions of the Constitution of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.003" offset="7848396">A legislature in drawing municipal boundaries and extract it -- and expanding them or contracting them as the case may be acts entirely as it pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.918" offset="7888102">The second ground is that this -- this law on its face has not a word on -- on race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.012" offset="7924464">It's neutral.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.533" offset="13794492">If I may before getting into the main part of my argument, answer a few questions that were asked yesterday that was not cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.318" offset="13829705">Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked when Tuskegee Institute was organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.172" offset="13845065">It was in 1881.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.250" offset="13857395">You also asked I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter, about the previous boundaries of Tuskegee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.570" offset="13882681">Tuskegee was first organized in 1866 with the boundary of 2.5 miles on each side, the boundaries being equidistant from the then courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.192" offset="13929179">In 1868, by an act of the Legislature, those boundaries were pulled in to an area of 1 mile square.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.782" offset="13967527">History gives some very interesting side lights of why that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.575" offset="13986649">Later on, they were expanded again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.837" offset="13995739">There have been several acts and I believe the last act that really touched the boundaries in any significance was an Act of 1898, which again placed the manner in this position 2.5 miles square.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.689" offset="14059165">The question was asked as to following police jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.057" offset="14076615">That's a general statute of Alabama applicable to all towns and cities, in towns having a population of 6000 people according to the last federal census, the police limits are 3 miles beyond the corporate limits and in towns of less than 6000 is 1.5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.201" offset="14149235">Tuskegee at the present time has police jurisdiction of 3 miles beyond the new city limits by reason of the fact as we haven't had the official 1960 census, we yet announced nor have we had a legislature meet as it will next year after the announcing of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.454" offset="14218198">It's a -- the population of Tuskegee is less than 6000 without the next legislature then of course, we'll refer it back to the 1.5 mile limit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.231" offset="14673356">Now, we also point out here as to the population of this area, the way it was drawn, the little argument they pulled in, you will see here, for example, a rather heavily populated neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.276" offset="14729467">That's -- that's a Negro neighborhood there, which begins out here and it goes way off.</text>

            <text syncTime="3699.815" offset="14903651">Now, I believe yesterday there was some method asked about the procedure for changing boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.432" offset="14926117">The Constitution of Alabama provides and this Act was not as -- the first counsel suggested a private act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.636" offset="14950985">It was a local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.440" offset="14958195">Pass after notice and proof regarding to our Constitution, to pass such a law, you have to advertise it for weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.391" offset="14981914">That's to give the people affected, I tend to come in and protest if they desire to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.850" offset="14999782">As far as I know, there's no -- this -- this law is advertised, no protest was ever made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.629" offset="15018904">Now, that's a perfectly legal and been upheld by our State Supreme Court as being the proper way to change boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.122" offset="15048892">In fact, nearly all boundaries in Alabama changed that way, harm the session of legislation of what means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.241" offset="15069372">But you won't have 50 to 100 boundary line changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.776" offset="15083478">There's probably been thousands since our Constitution in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.424" offset="15102077">Now, there is -- there are other ways of changing boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.923" offset="15120050">For example, in the city, the city made by -- initiate its own proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.298" offset="15137604">The counsel may propose it and by -- present it to the probate judge and then by popular election, bring in additional territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.962" offset="15172295">You could also contract the city that same way the city here could initiate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.982" offset="15188281">This was state action, however not city action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.646" offset="15198939">This was done by the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.190" offset="15209179">Also I thought as to fact that a -- that people, 75 or more people, may form a municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.200" offset="15241153">In other words the people outside here, they form their own municipality if they care to do so and may initiate the action and carry it right through separate by a popular vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.363" offset="15277829">Now, I believe that probably gets us down except to one thing that Mr. Justice Stewart makes in the essence that the district judge characterized this as a sea dragon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.753" offset="15311370">That was the plaintiffs that characterized the sea dragon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.849" offset="15323805">He put it in quotes in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.379" offset="15333940">Now, as we look at it, it might be a bit of a descriptive term and it would take ones imagination but that's not too unusual looking outfit when we look somewhere in the cities in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.171" offset="15389111">And last night I haven't pick up to run magnetic road add list and of course we've been a good bit out of this record all the way through, so we might just mention someone -- man in town of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.054" offset="15440624">I suppose it looks more like a cloud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.854" offset="15447834">These boys, they used to lay on the grass and watch the clouds and figure what it looks like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.177" offset="15465075">Concord, New Hampshire, Stanford, Connecticut, Scranton, Pennsylvania, it looks likes a jigsaw puzzle sitting on top of the other, Cincinnati, Ohio by this bed, even Sacramento California (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.186" offset="15509170">So you just don't know why the city has the boundary lines it has but let's get down now to what I consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.921" offset="15540099">If Your Honor please, to meet and the (Inaudible) in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.607" offset="15558802">And that is this and finally after being in the lower court and the Court of Appeals, finally for the first time on page 11 in the petitioner's brief is we have to get them to admit there were such cases as Hunter versus Pittsburgh and Laramie County versus Albany County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.466" offset="15630273">The Hunter versus Pittsburgh and Laramie County versus Albany County, Mount Pleasant versus Beckwith are the cases upon which we stood in the lower court of the fundamental merits here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.784" offset="15675517">And that is the power of a State acting through its legislature as a sovereign right to extend comfort limits, to draw him in, to consolidate cities or to abolish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.275" offset="15741450">That's true of counties and it's true cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.969" offset="15752317">The first case only said, it was the old Laramie County versus Albany County which involves county lines and of course the county is simply a political subdivision of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.898" offset="15792024">It's a creation of the State created for the convenient administration of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.012" offset="15812399">Shortly after that, we came to Mount Pleasant versus Beckwith where they, again, pointed out that corporations are composed of all the inhabits of the territory, all the people who lived within the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.217" offset="15861300">And they see that the organization and the territory maybe modified and I'm now quoting from Court by the mere wheel of the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.872" offset="15903932">Now, that goes back, if the Court pleases, to other quotations we look into this constitutional limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.496" offset="15930368">We find Professor Coolidge saying that they may as a political manner the drawing of boundary lines for cities and political subdivision peculiar that vested in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.784" offset="15971537">And it says this, "If the legislative action in these cases operate injuriously to the municipalities or to individuals, the remedy is not with the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.492" offset="16018348">The courts have no file to interfere and the people must be looked to, to write through the ballot box all these wrongs.</text>

            <text syncTime="5094.842" offset="20483720">It's been studied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.151" offset="20489049">It's been studied on several theories, not only the constitutional issues themselves but upon the question of judicial restraint in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.640" offset="20523008">The court below looked and Judge Wisdom did, that this is about as highly political thing as anybody can get into as to where boundary lines go.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.430" offset="20558117">If we start drawing boundary lines as such for every ward and every precinct and everything is going to be question after question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.084" offset="20596778">Now, in Colegrove, we get back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.525" offset="20610466">In that case, of course, was your congressional redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.960" offset="20628229">It's not exactly this case and I wouldn't say that it pronounced any absolutes but it did point out that the courts generally refrain from getting into the political figure of districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.956" offset="20672219">Now, this is not, as I say, a congressional district but it does draw lines of a political subdivision of a State in the South versus Peters, where again we had the question of the Georgia unit vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.533" offset="20722479">And there, the courts simply went all from the proposition that it was a political question because it wouldn't get into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.468" offset="20750273">Now, there was a dissent to that case and the argument in that case was very much as it was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.279" offset="20773470">The argument in that case being that the effect and purpose of the Georgia unit system, its purpose and effect was to dilute and to cut down on the vote of Negroes, and I believe, labor, but this Court nevertheless with Justice Black -- Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas dissenting held in that case that it was not a matter for judicial concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.652" offset="20879005">We say that this is a matter of local policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.103" offset="20892797">We say as the cases are pointed out that it's a question of local policy, purely political, that the courts held all the -- all the way back, not only these matters of equity, but it's a matter of judicial abstention if you please or judicial self-limitation perhaps would be the better word.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.167" offset="20961029">They have refused to go in to cases of this kind, which pose the line drawing political questions that this would and someone said, "Then what's the remedy?"</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.064" offset="21004601">He said the only remedy we could have would be to declare this Act unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.726" offset="21023305">Of course there, we go back to proposition that you -- you've got intervening rights and have come up in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.108" offset="21048801">We have this Act that was passed in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.915" offset="21068027">It was advertised two to three months before that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5247.393" offset="21093940">It did anything to almost 14 to 15 months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.684" offset="21111181">And then they decided they were which makes you wanted sometimes that people had rather have a lawsuit than to try -- use their right to petition on the Constitution to say, "Well, I don't think this law is right and I wish you wouldn't do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.363" offset="21165829">Now, we'd assume that legislators will not listen to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.548" offset="21182548">We'd assume that their right of petition had to go down and discuss this thing as they don't go this far, but go somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.679" offset="21211073">You -- you're not doing the right by us.</text>

            <text syncTime="5287.389" offset="21253914">But now, we come back at this late 80s, even intervening election and say, "Oh no, let's get into this thing now and tell us maybe where the line should be drawn," and say, "But all the courts not drawing a line."</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.296" offset="21301561">Well, of course you can say it in this case, but if we draw another in some way as some court sometime has got to tell us how far we can go.</text>

            <text syncTime="5401.085" offset="21708758">But he did point this out and we'll come back to the situation in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5419.498" offset="21782424">I just have one word and I just want to point out to the Court what we -- again, what we think the propositions are before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.726" offset="21819308">What we are -- we have alleged, made allegations that Act 140 accomplishes disenfranchising based upon race and a denial of residence because of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.238" offset="21865388">It is our opposition, if the Court please, that we are entitled to have that both claims heard in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.951" offset="21904154">The abatement of racial discrimination has always been the business of -- of the -- of the courts and particularly, the federal court certainly since the civil war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.413" offset="21938009">The fact that this was done by virtually of boundary lines and so forth we think makes no difference that the question we think that we're entitled to is to go into a court, to have a hearing and to put -- and to submit proof that racial discrimination, which we alleged had been accomplished and as such, we think that this is -- this is our case and that this case is governed as we said before by the race discrimination cases, where this thing has been aligned.</text>
