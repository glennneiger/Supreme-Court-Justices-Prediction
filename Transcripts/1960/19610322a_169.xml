            <label>Mr. Isaac M. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="7.761" offset="134457">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.881" offset="142921">When we closed yesterday, I pointed out that the Government in contending that these were words of arts applicable only to natural resources relied on two sections of the 1918 law; one, in which the words prospecting, exploration, and discovery were used and the other in which the word discovery was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.453" offset="213138">The main emphasis of the Government has been on Section 337 which the Government asserts was the original source of Section 721 (a) (2) (C) and Section 456 (a) (2) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="38.828" offset="258696">We agree that in attempting to find the intent underlying 456 (a) (2) (B), it is helpful to go back to the Revenue Act of 1918 where we believe that the Government has gone back to the wrong section.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.732" offset="310314">Section 456 is a Section designed to give relief for abnormal income in an excess profits tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.391" offset="336959">The 1918 Act also had this Section giving relief for abnormalities and income and an excess profits tax year, and that with Section 327 (d), which Your Honors will find on page 25 (a) of the appendix to the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.501" offset="393383">Section 327 (d) provided that where owing to abnormal conditions affecting the capital or income of the corporation, the tax would work in exceptional hardship upon the corporation evidenced by a gross disproportion between the tax computed without benefit of that Section and the tax computed by reference to the representative corporations referred to in Section 328.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.912" offset="487006">The tax was to be determined as provided in Section 328 and under 328, an adjustment of the tax was made to bring it into line with the tax imposed upon representative corporations in the same industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.497" offset="537370">To understand just what were the abnormal conditions referred to in 327 (d), the history of this Section is illuminating and we believe particularly significant in construing Section 456 (a) (2) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="121.884" offset="590869">As originally introduced in the House, Section 327 mentioned three abnormal conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.552" offset="613543">In the Senate, the bill was considerably expanded to include a number of additional abnormal conditions and one of them is particularly pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.497" offset="645308">I'm referring to Section 327 (e) (3) (B) of the senate bill which Your Honors will find printed on pages three and four on petitioner's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.696" offset="686164">That subsection in the senate amendment listed as an abnormal condition, the situation where the net income for the taxable year is abnormally high due to the realization in one year of extraordinary gains or profits derived from the sale of property, the principal value of which has been demonstrated by prospecting or exploration and discovery work.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.014" offset="771427">And you will note Your Honor that there's no mention as there was in 337, specifically in the case of mines, oils or gas wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.158" offset="804028">Now in conference, the language of Section 327 was changed to the form in which it was primarily enacted, but the language changes were intended only to consolidate into one general classification, all of the various classes of abnormal conditions listed in the senate amendment and not to eliminate any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.682" offset="878111">This intention to amalgamate and not to eliminate is confirmed by the Conference Committee Report by statements of various senators on the senate floor and by a ruling of the Solicitor of Internal Revenue to which we have referred in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.912" offset="935058">The Solicitor of Internal Revenue had the decision, the question of whether a manufacturing company which had spent substantial sums and to use his words, experimental and discovery work in developing a secret formula which had given the Company a virtual monopoly which sums have not been capitalized, was entitled to relief under Section 327.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.500" offset="1029413">He stated that in order to learn just what Congress intended by the words abnormal conditions in Section 327 (d), it was necessary to resort to the list of abnormal conditions contained in the senate version of that Section and he ruled that such a company was entitled to relief under Section 327.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.353" offset="1100779">The use of the words experimental and discovery work shows that he did not regard those words as limited only to the extractive industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.878" offset="1134843">He had to find abnormal condition under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.913" offset="1147068">In order to qualify it for relief he found it in the section to which I have referred, which refers to exploration, discovery and prospecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.454" offset="1181236">It is interesting to note that at the same time as the Senate was amending Section 327, it introduced them to the bill by way of amendment Section 337 upon which the Government relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.466" offset="1229197">This time coincidence enables us to make a pertinent comparison between these two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.479" offset="1253334">Section 337 was admittedly a Section designed to give relief solely to mines, oils and gas wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.150" offset="1279979">And the Senate left no doubt as to that intention by saying so in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.856" offset="1298787">In both Sections explicitly, it says in the case of mines, oil or gas wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.448" offset="1317177">Had the Senate had similar intent to Section 327, it would be expected that it would have shown it in similar fashion, but it did not do this in Section 327.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.526" offset="1357511">On the contrary, it used the general word property in listing as an abnormal condition, extraordinary gains or profits derived from the sale of property, the principal value of which has been demonstrated by exploration or discovery work.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.378" offset="1412890">Had the Senate the intent of limiting the provision in 327, as it had done in 337, it would have been easy for the draftsmen to have provided in the case of mines, oil or gas wells extraordinary gains or profits derived from the sale and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.811" offset="1474644">That the words prospecting or exploration and discovery work as used in the Senate's version of 327 were understood to have general meaning applicable to oil corporations and oil industries, it's not only confirmed by the opinion of the Solicitor of Internal Revenue to which I have referred, but also by the action of the Conference Committee in merging all the classes of the senate amendment into one general classification.</text>

            <label>Mr. Isaac M. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="373.087" offset="1595747">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.267" offset="1600449">That these words had reference only to the operations of the extractive industries, they could not have been so merged.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.106" offset="1627826">Moreover, if one looks at the Senate Committee report which accompanied Section 337 and Your Honors will find that printed on page 25 of the Government's brief in the Searle case, that Section has headed gains derived from prospecting, exploration, or discovery and one notes that the Senate saw fit in addition to giving its reasons for the enactment of Section 337, to call attention in that subdivision to the increased depletion allowance allowed under Section 234 (a) (9).</text>
            <text syncTime="414.062" offset="1759587">No reference whatever was made to Section 327.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.661" offset="1774007">And here is a situation where they just got through amending 327, and if it deprived only to the extractive industries, it would have been expected that it would have mentioned it under this heading gains derived from prospecting, exploration, or discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.705" offset="1830222">So, that under the 1918 Act, we have history to the effect that these words have been used in a context applicable to others in the extractive industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.470" offset="1873272">We now come to Section -- to the World War II law.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.568" offset="1893648">Abnormalities in tax year income were covered in the World War II law in Section 721.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.860" offset="1922800">And with respect to such abnormalities, Congress introduced a new concept to determine abnormality by classes of income, yet it is not unreasonable to assume that in establishing the class of income described in 721 (a) (2) (C), which was income resulting from exploration, discovery, prospecting, research or development of tangible property, patents, processes or formulae, Congress was not unmindful of the formal of provision in Section 327 (d) of the 1918 Act and of the history of that Section and how it was interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.684" offset="2074102">In fact the phrasing of Section 721 of the original Act, which Your Honors will find printed in the footnote on page 6 of the Government's reply brief, I think demonstrates that Section 721 was patterned on 327 (d) of the 1918 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.015" offset="2139408">You will note that the words grossly disproportionate are used, instead of the mathematical formula for determining abnormality that later resolved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.131" offset="2175875">These are the same words that were used in Section 327 (d), but whether it was packing on the 1918 Act or not, I submit that the legislative history which I have just recounted, demonstrates that the words exploration, discovery and prospecting had not become words of art referring only to the mining industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.890" offset="2262915">It is also clear that the provisions of Section 721 in all its subdivisions were intended to apply to corporations in oil industries and this was confirmed by the statements on the senate floor to which we have adverted in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.694" offset="2326131">Senator George was asked for example as to what was the additional benefit to the mining industry and he replied that provision was helpful not only to a mining corporation, it was helpful to any type of corporation and I might add that applying the principle of noscitur a sociis to 721 (a) (2) (C), you couldn't come up with any common denominator that the words apply only to the mining industry.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="581.421" offset="2429053">Did Senator George (Inaudible) the bills?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="isaac_m_barnett" startTime="583.509" stopTime="1087.052">
            <label>Mr. Isaac M. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="583.509" offset="2437413">I think he was, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.757" offset="2454444">Now Section 721 (a) (2) (C) was much broader than the provisions in the senate version of 327 of the 1918 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.457" offset="2497181">There was added to the concept of abnormal income, abnormal income resulting from research or development of tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.747" offset="2530408">Now, the word "research" is a very broad word.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.614" offset="2541798">It does not necessarily mean only laboratory research.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.728" offset="2558307">We speak of legal research.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.765" offset="2566457">There is research in business, in marketing methods, in manufacturing costs, and various analysis and surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.428" offset="2593102">And this addition which was added in the 9th -- in the Second World War Act of the word "research" led to a substantial number of -- a substantial increase in the applications for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.723" offset="2650258">Now let us consider Section 456 (a) (2) (B) in the light of this legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.741" offset="2674291">This Section, according to the Committee reports, is Section 721 (a) (2) (C) with the word "research" or development of tangible property left out.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.912" offset="2715042">Now, if this was a brand new Section that was originally created in the Korean War then maybe the principle of noscitur a sociis may conceivably have applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.290" offset="2760495">But what it was, was a derivation of an old Section and to find out what the meaning of these words were, you have to go back to the old Section and certainly the principle of noscitur a sociis doesn't -- in 721 (a) (2) (C) doesn't result in the holding that it applies only to the natural resource industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.258" offset="2836355">Unless there was a clear indication of attempt to change the meaning of the words which were left in, in 456 (a) (2) (B) by taking out the words research or development, the words exploration, discovery and prospecting continues to have the same general meaning applicable to all types of corporations, as they had, we submit in Section 721 (a) (2) (C) and before that in 327.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.022" offset="2947427">Now there was no evidence that by deleting the words research and development, Congress intended to change the meaning of the words it retained and the Government concedes that the word discovery in 456 (a) (2) (B) has the same meaning as in 721 (a) (2) (C).</text>
            <text syncTime="727.482" offset="3013256">Now, Congress has told us the purpose of the deletion of the words research and development of tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.059" offset="3039587">It was to plug a potential loophole found to exist in the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.544" offset="3057560">Now, a loophole is getting something to which you're not entitled, getting a form of relief to which you're not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.214" offset="3092250">Now, what was this loophole?</text>
            <text syncTime="749.143" offset="3099982">We venture to suggest that the loophole which had -- was one which have been created by the extension of qualification of relief under Section 721 (a) (2) (C) generally to research or development of tangible property which had not in and of itself been recognized as abnormal condition under 327 (d) of the 1918 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.766" offset="3190471">This potential loophole stems from the inability in certain cases arising under Section 721 (a) (2) (C) of establishing what income, if any, resulted from the research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.722" offset="3246268">It had the company that had a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.550" offset="3253582">It did some research and development and improved the product, and if so, the improved product, you couldn't tell what demand there was for the product -- what demand there would have been from the product during that year even if that hadn't been improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.248" offset="3316381">So, it was impossible to separate the demand for the basic product -- from the product improved by the alleged research and development and that was the potential loophole which Congress sought to strike to -- to -- to plug.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.648" offset="3382000">And if that potential loophole does not exist though in the case of a discovery of a new basic invention, since “but for” the discovery, there would have been no income at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.614" offset="3421811">And accordingly, whatever income resulted is directly traceable to the discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.953" offset="3443231">Thus, in this case, the Tax Court made findings of fact to the effect that Polaroid's income from the Polaroid Land Process during the tax year resulted entirely from its capacity to produce a picture in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.225" offset="3496312">If this process had not made an instantaneous positive print, this is the finding, there would have been no commercial demand for this camera or photographic fact during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.659" offset="3538004">Now, with respect to the other discovery, the 3-D Synthetic Polarizer, the Tax Court found the exhibition of 3-D motion pictures would not have been commercially practicable, had petitioner's synthetic polarizers were not been available.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.727" offset="3594324">No, not infringing material for this practice was on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.365" offset="3608848">So, there was no question of allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.625" offset="3617834">This is brand new.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.244" offset="3624312">All the income proceeded from -- from the discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.931" offset="3639045">It's not the type of thing that Mr. Barnett mentioned in his argument like giving allowance for the capital you have, the selling organization and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.117" offset="3679796">Those things are involved in the sale of oil or the output of mines just as much is they are involved in the sale of a camera or a drug and so forth and they still continue to -- to be factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.014" offset="3727444">It have to be taken into account and the regulations so prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.637" offset="3741968">The regulation say, the present regulation say that you can attribute to prior years any income resulting some increased demand lessen competition and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.661" offset="3781987">So that it's recognized that there has to be some editing of the income based upon certain other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.707" offset="3810200">In addition to that, as Your Honors remember I said yesterday, we have a stipulation here so that the Government and we have agreed as to how much of the income proceeded from the -- from these discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.618" offset="3861817">Now, the Government apparently acknowledges that ours is a type of case which considering the purpose of Section 456 would be entitled to relief but it answered unfortunately, we are one of the meritorious cases which was sacrificed in the interest of the administrative simplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.657" offset="3934020">We hope we are a meritorious case, but we are not one of those referred to in the Committee reports as having to be sacrificed.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.200" offset="3964217">The meritorious cases they refer to were cases in which a major portion of the income could have come from the improvement which resulted from the research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.331" offset="4008730">But because of the inability to separate what income came from the improvement and what income was the basic -- came from the basic demand for the product that was the type of the case which had to be sacrificed.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.139" offset="4059930">No administrative discretion is involved in determining the income from a new basic discovery and Congress had no intention we submit of barring such a case from relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.094" offset="4103711">In other words, Congress indicated intent, plugged a loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.510" offset="4117400">We can assume that it intended to do anything more than -- than what was necessary to plug that loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.002" offset="4143417">And if Congress had any intent of eliminating from relief all industries other than the extractive industries, although those industries got relief under the two prior Excess Profits Tax laws, if it was making as drastic a change as that you would expect that it would have said something in its Committee reports in that connection, but it said nothing like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.755" offset="4234428">All it was doing was to plug a loophole with respect to certain cases involving research -- research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.660" offset="4270059">And I might add that the word discovery does not necessarily presuppose research.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.532" offset="4289494">I don't imagine that Einstein's discovery of Law of Relativity required any research before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.211" offset="5540237">Let's say we agree that there is a difference in degree in the quality of inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.368" offset="5564792">Some are major and some are minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.049" offset="5575555">We don't quite understand where the definition of discovery comes from that would include one and not the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.478" offset="5605334">The difference is not that one is whether something has been discovered; the difference has been what has been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.525" offset="5637517">You discover more, you discover less, but they are both equally discoveries in the dictionary sense of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.934" offset="5671058">The important thing though I think is that there is no basis in the legislative history of Section 456 for thinking that Congress was concerned with the difference as to the difference in degree between big inventions and small inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.436" offset="5749112">The administrative difficulty that explains why Congress took out the statute research and development is not in distinguishing kinds of inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.984" offset="5799267">The taxpayer says that if you have a new product, all of the income from its sale would not exist but for the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.577" offset="5833644">Of course that's true in a “but for” sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.813" offset="5846601">The “but for” causation is not the same as how you allocate the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.260" offset="5880456">In the first place, I think the Polaroid camera is a good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.673" offset="5910026">It's relatively expensive item and it presumably would appeal only to people who are relatively affluent and to the extent that the stimulus to the war time economy added to the disposable income, it also added to the demand for the camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.298" offset="5976586">More importantly, however, the demand for a new product is not readymade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.256" offset="6000410">You have to make a demand and the way that you create a demand is by advertising and that's the way Polaroid created the demand for its camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.818" offset="6042624">Now, quite apart from those factors certainly some of the income realized is simply the income from manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.835" offset="6074702">If you -- if you manufacture and sell even a non-patented item, you usually make a profit, so that you cannot say that all of the profit is attributable to the value of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.613" offset="6125798">That is the royalty element of the profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.581" offset="6141680">You would have to segregate out of the sales income, a constructive royalty as it were, that you would attribute as being due to the value of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.558" offset="6185566">You would have to allocate the rest of the income to manufacturing profit, sales promotion activities, return on capital and the investment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.482" offset="7193266">I might say that all of the cases under Section 721 did involve manufacturers who were selling their own products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.339" offset="7220746">You never had this royalty measured and in fact what the Tax Court ended up doing was expressly recognizing that the allocation was a matter of opinion and judgment and as a matter of fact admitted that no two people could ever agree on how you allocated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.816" offset="7286680">And the way it resolved the cases in practice was to end up with a conclusory finding of fact stating what the allocation is without attempting to explain how they arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.720" offset="7326281">And that -- that is what Congress meant when it said that it could not provide for relief for this kind of thing without an undesirably broad range of discretionary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.345" offset="7384795">Now, Congress also gave a -- and that's equally true if it's brand new product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.912" offset="7402977">You still have that problem of allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.556" offset="7417605">Congress also gave a separate reason, namely that, the need for relief for this kind of income was not as great as the need for relief for other kinds of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.109" offset="7467760">That appears in the Committee report at page 12 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.173" offset="7488031">I would like to suggest why that is, why there is a less need for the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.677" offset="7514049">The other classes of income, classes A, C and D, namely judgments, the sale of the invention itself or change of accounting method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.605" offset="7561801">Now, those are all clearly one time transactions that are unusual in the life of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.078" offset="7587715">I would say a lumping of income in one year of the events giving rise to which have nothing to do with that yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.327" offset="7624704">Now, the taxpayers claim that their equitable right to relief the justification for extended relief is just like that for oil wells included in class D and they make that similarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.025" offset="7683427">Now, because they're oil production, you do have a continuing production of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.200" offset="7708191">It isn't the one shot we see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.344" offset="7724701">Now, the difference there, I think for justification for including minerals is that the taxpayer is using out a wasting asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.256" offset="7768377">He is selling off his underlying oil deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.720" offset="7786245">Now, that's important for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.804" offset="7794604">If he greatly increased his production of oil during the excess profits tax years, he really wouldn't be better off because he wouldn't have that same oil to sell after the excess profits tax years and there would be a strong incentive for him to reduce his production during the excess profit tax years and save his oil until the excess profit tax was gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.355" offset="7888750">And I think that is essentially a justification for allowing this relief to the mineral industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.296" offset="7916544">Now in a case of invention of patent, you lose nothing when you produce more during the war years because the patent expires not over units of production, but over time and the more you produce, the more you can still produce more later, so they're very different in nature in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.016" offset="8003480">Now, more -- the other reason is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.624" offset="8021870">Most people who have research and development income are continually engaged in research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.406" offset="8049037">This is not one item that they discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.800" offset="8066591">Searle has very large research department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.519" offset="8081429">Their business is developing new drugs and selling them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.624" offset="8101909">That is also true to Polaroid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.753" offset="8110373">And during the excess profit tax years, they were engaging in research and development and deducting the cost of research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.517" offset="8149452">Now, to be logically consistent, if we were to throw back to the earlier years, the income resulting from the prior research and development, you ought to bring into the excess profit tax years the future income which results from the -- their research and development during the excess profits tax years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.788" offset="8230536">Now, I think it's obviously not a practical thing to do and I think the Congress' solution was sound to treat research and development as a current item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.138" offset="8267943">You take the income into account when you receive it and you don't try to trace each item back to the years in which it was developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.771" offset="8306500">Now -- so I think those are the two reasons why research and development income was taken out of the eligible classes in the Korean War law, both the administrative feasibility of segregating the income and the lack of a pressing and even say debatable justification for providing that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.844" offset="8426768">Now, I would like to turn -- I would like to turn, if I may now, to the last sentence of Section 456 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.761" offset="8478386">This is the alternative argument that is made by both taxpayers, which I did not deal with yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.703" offset="8510151">We have set forth the section in a skeletal form on page two of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.421" offset="8541080">That's the one, the consolidated brief in 151 and 169.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.331" offset="8560724">It's in skeletal form to emphasize the provisions relevant to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.494" offset="8573367">That is assuming that it is not within class B, they argue that they're entitled to relief under the last sentence of paragraph (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.939" offset="8615163">That sentence reads the classification of income of any class not described in subparagraphs (A) to (D) inclusive shall be subject to regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.806" offset="8670647">Their argument is that that makes all income of whatever nature and of whatever kind eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.590" offset="8709726">Now, before I try to answer that argument, I would like to state what the significance of it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.909" offset="8735013">In terms, it is all inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.466" offset="8741282">It includes all kinds of income, but it doesn't do you any good to have to qualify as abnormal income unless there is a basis for attribution, a basis for attributing the income to prior years under subsection B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.688" offset="8806170">Now, virtually the only kind of income that is not expressly provided for elsewhere in the statute for which there could be claimed a basis of attribution is research and development income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.054" offset="8851623">So the net effect of their argument really is, the practical operation, to say that the last sentence brings back within the statute the very kind of income that Congress expressly took out of the enumerated classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.334" offset="8908675">Now, it may be that that's a necessary result of the last sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.270" offset="8920482">I think it's a rather remarkable result and one that should be avoided if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.248" offset="8944410">Turning to what the last sentence does mean, I confess that I have no easy answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.196" offset="8972204">There is no interpretation of the last sentence simply from the words that is consistent with the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.441" offset="9009089">In order to give it a meaning, I would like to go through the exercise by first trying to show that the last sentence doesn't mean anything and then show how you can give it a meaning, which is consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.059" offset="9075649">I would do that first just on the face of the statute and then show that under the legislative history that in fact got into the statute apparently by inadvertence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.014" offset="9479398">The last sentence is as I have said provides for the classification of income of any class not described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.921" offset="9511058">Now, literally, that seems to provide for the classification of all income because all income is of some class and that's basically their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.371" offset="9540838">We can concede that, that all income is of a class, but what happens to the class after you classified it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.105" offset="9579813">Now, the last sentence doesn't tell you that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.374" offset="9592874">You have to go back to paragraph one, which is the operative definition of abnormal income and paragraph one says that the term abnormal income means an income of any class described in paragraph two, not income of any class, but any class describing paragraph two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.672" offset="9666017">And paragraph two starts out by saying that each of the following subparagraphs shall be held to describe a separate class of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.899" offset="9703006">And the last sentence says that the classification of income of any class not described in the subparagraphs shall be subject regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.090" offset="9735711">So the last sentence -- income is not described and the definition of abnormal income applies only to income which is described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.514" offset="9769462">And so that the last sentence literally, reading it very literally and I confess this is a very literal reading, the last sentence provides for classification that has no operative effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.822" offset="9946676">And so classes of income which are not described are not abnormal income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.224" offset="9964231">So they are classes of income but they're not abnormal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.519" offset="9973426">They're not eligible to qualify as abnormal classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.278" offset="9984502">Now, I don't expect anyone to be persuaded by this argument as a matter of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.216" offset="10008221">I just want to set up the problem in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.142" offset="10019924">Now, the way that last sentence got into the statute is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.521" offset="10041448">As I have said, 456 came from Section 721 of the World War II law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.011" offset="10067466">In the 1940 Act, Section 721 was in very different form and was limited to the six classes of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.355" offset="10100799">It was revised in 1941 into the form that appears on pages six and seven of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.774" offset="10150431">You will note that there, the abnormal income is defined to me, income of any class includable in gross income, any class at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.416" offset="10201004">It is not limited to any class described in paragraph (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.734" offset="10214275">It means income of any class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.949" offset="10227127">Now, with that definition of abnormal income, you have to provide for classification of all classes of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.581" offset="10273729">And so, there, paragraph (2) did define separate classes of income and after enumerating six classes provided for the classification of all other income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.116" offset="10319809">Now, the important thing about the last sentence in Section 721 is that all it did was to provide for the grouping, the classification which items you put together and which of those classes, if any, were eligible for relief was determined by paragraph one and the reason why 721 was very broad in scope is because paragraph one defined abnormal income as meaning income of any class includable in gross income, all income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.699" offset="10454183">Now, that's not quite as strange as it sounds because I have said -- said before, abnormal income, the test of abnormal income is only the first step and you then have to show that it is attributable to prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.227" offset="10512280">The effect of this definition of abnormal income was to lead to the attribution requirements in subsection B, the function of limiting relief to the proper kinds of income, but there was no test in subsection A, no qualitative test of what is abnormal income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.908" offset="10590960">Any income could be abnormal and that was the function of the last sentence, purely, the accounting breakdown of income into several classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.296" offset="10632547">We then come to the Korean War law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.498" offset="10649370">The House Bill, where it originated repeated all the same language of Section 721, including the unlimited definition of abnormal income in paragraph (1) as meaning, income of any class includable in gross income and therefore also the last sentence providing for the classification of all income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.010" offset="10739440">The only change the House made in the bill from the predecessor bill was in the described classes, which were cut down to four classes and there was that change of the research and development was omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.817" offset="10810598">Now, literally, if you read its bill literally, it really hadn't done very much because although it took research and development income out of the described classes, abnormal income wasn't limited to the described classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.531" offset="10869530">So the only defect literally was that research and development had to be put into another class, but which was equally eligible for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.443" offset="10909132">Now, its report however, the report of the House Committee which is at page 12, I think obviously reflects that they have done more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.608" offset="10957824">It states, after describing the kind of adjustment, adjustments of this type are limited to income arising out of at least the four classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.412" offset="11000978">It then has the discussion that I have talked about earlier saying why they have deleted research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.314" offset="11032639">And they don't speak of deleting that simply from enumerating classes to put it some place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.574" offset="11053641">They end up saying that's why that item has been omitted from the list of abnormal types of income for which a reallocation can be made under this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.523" offset="11101497">So the report clearly speaks as though relief were limited to the four classes and none other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.116" offset="11127829">And by taking research and development out of the enumerated classes, it thought it was denying relief altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.868" offset="11158862">Whereas I say, the bill didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.782" offset="11166490">The bill had the same language that'd been put in, in 1941 for the very purpose of extending relief beyond the enumerated classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.920" offset="11203062">Now, when the bill got to the Senate, the Senate was faced with a choice whether they wanted to agree with the House Report or with the House Bill, because they were very different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.715" offset="11238275">And it shows the House Report and agreed with the report, it adopted the report verbatim, but it amended the bill to make the bill conform to the report and they did that by two amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.777" offset="11294490">Amendment Number 200 inserted in paragraph one the phrase described in paragraph two so that an abnormal income was defined as income of any class described in paragraph two, which meant the quantitative test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.122" offset="11359901">Now -- I'm sorry -- which meant the quantitative test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.422" offset="11373066">There's always the quantitative test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.499" offset="11381321">After you establish eligibility, you have to estab -- meet the quantitative test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.007" offset="11403368">Now, since it limited the definition of abnormal income to the described classes, the last sentence providing for the classification of other income was unnecessary, so it deleted that sentence in Amendment 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.514" offset="11461465">Now, at that point, the bill said exactly what the Committee report said and everything was very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.539" offset="11485497">Then the bill went to the conference and in conference, what happened -- the result of what happened is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.360" offset="11516844">The conference accepted the Amendment to the definition of abnormal income limiting it to the classes described in paragraph (2), but rejected the Amendment striking the last sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.240" offset="11812342">I agree with that, but certainly the author of the words described in paragraph (2), that is the Senate, meant by that the classes described in paragraph (2) and literally, the last sentence says provides for the classification of any class of income not described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.874" offset="11890918">So it uses the same word described, it says not described and I think one or the other of the provisions doesn't fit, that they don't belong together.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.292" offset="12020590">The taxpayer says that our reading of the last sentence results in our reading the same language in two Acts, the World War II Act and this Act to mean different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.299" offset="12064580">That is not quite right because if you read the last sentence to mean exactly the same thing that it didn't mean in 721, it would mean nothing because all in that in 721 was accounting and it didn't say -- it was not the last sentence that said that the resulting classes were eligible, it was paragraph (1) that said that and there is a different paragraph (1) and it's really from paragraph (1) that we derive a different ultimate effect of the last sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.606" offset="12177847">Now, since read isn't a classification provision alone, the last sentence doesn't do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.099" offset="12203760">You have to really read it as also not only providing for classification, but somehow providing that the resulting classes are to be eligible to qualify as abnormal income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.005" offset="12255378">And our interpretation ultimately amounts to reading it as though it said not with the classification of any class of income not described through its sets of regulations, but as though it said the eligibility of any class of income not described in the regulations, in the subparagraphs shall be subject to regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.941" offset="12343150">That is to say the secretary has a discretionary power to prescribe specific additional classes which shall be eligible for relief.</text>
