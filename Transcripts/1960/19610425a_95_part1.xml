            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 95, Veron Atchley, also known as Jack Atchley, Petitioner, versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.900" offset="150967">Ms. Asher.</text>

            <label>Ms. Rosalie S. Asher</label>
            <text syncTime="13.379" offset="156923">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.912" offset="171029">Before embarking appointed discussion of the case in its merits, I should like to correct a misstatement or an ambiguity appearing in our reply to respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.366" offset="220871">At page 9 in discussing the case of Ziang Sung Wan versus United States, it might appear that we argue that later cases require a Fifth Amendment to be made applicable to state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.858" offset="274787">Counsels are aware that such is not the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.138" offset="283878">We are aware of Twining versus New Jersey and Adamson versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.988" offset="307284">We can only apologize and explain that this error resulted when as a -- the matter -- as a result of the matter and the haste of which the response was necessarily prepared, the argument was not fully developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.742" offset="370291">What should have been further stated is that without claiming that the Fifth Amendment operates to restrict the State of California, we do maintain that all of the factors in this case must be considered in their totality to determine whether or not, this petitioner has been deprived of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and that the mere absence or presence of threats or promises standing alone is not determinative of the fact as to whether or not the confession was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.254" offset="504351">The voluntariness of that confession is the crux of this case, in determining which all relevant factors are to be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.643" offset="541968">There is a personal experience in stature of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.716" offset="558268">There is trickery and connivance in securing his tape recorded confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.538" offset="581569">There is secrecy as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.435" offset="589093">The defendant's repeated request for counsel having been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.313" offset="612603">All of these are methods, which history tells us, were involved during the inquisition, when the inquisitors demanded as the State would appear to demand for the police in this case, he completely freehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.278" offset="668505">These techniques have survived in authoritarian countries today where setting neighbor, to spy upon neighbor is not uncommon.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.317" offset="704658">And just so, as will be demonstrated, did the State set Mr. Travers to engage in conduct which is a kin to spying.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.348" offset="748753">We know from Chambers versus Florida and countless other cases that lawless means, irrespective of their ends, are not necessary to uphold the laws and are forbidden by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.686" offset="802147">Such practices likewise are inimitable to the accusatorial system, which many cases, including Watts versus Indiana and as recently as Rogers versus Richmond, have declared to be the law of the land under our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.796" offset="866513">Jack Atchley is not really the primary concern in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.599" offset="885739">Men have been executed before him on their own confession for homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.851" offset="910817">Doubt was more of a follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.301" offset="920534">But the vital consideration is the Constitution and whether under the Fourteenth Amendment, these confessions have been honestly secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.613" offset="957837">If this requirement is satisfied, no state conviction will be challenged, for no one condones murder and were all agreed that one who takes a life may not go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.000" offset="1007365">But very naturally is to be executed in the name of justice and justice, as it has delineated for the States by the Due Process Clause, is not satisfied, if he be executed upon his own confession, say that confession be honestly, freely, openly and voluntarily secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.715" offset="1094196">As this Court knows, the criterion has been stated in countless ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.824" offset="1110706">One being that a confession must be the product of a defendant's freewill.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.700" offset="1134216">Freewill is a concept troublesome, I think, to philosophers as well as to jurists.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.834" offset="1154696">And it's probably alludes in all embracing definition, but neither philosophically nor legally, it is submitted can it be said that a man is exercising his freewill, making a free choice, either to confess or to deny when, because he has duked and deceived, he is not aware that he is confessing.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.140" offset="1391888">This was not so much a confession elicited against the freewill of the defendant as one extracted, absent his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.433" offset="1429086">Briefly, to review for the Court with its permission to salient facts, Atchley had been arrested in the night, detained and questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.691" offset="1466180">He had consistently denied in conflicting stories that must be admitted, commission of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.433" offset="1493138">He had several times asked for an attorney that these pleas had gone unheeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.380" offset="1512887">Then he sent for his -- his friendly insurance agent, Mr. Travers.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.892" offset="1530964">They talked.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.628" offset="1537860">Upon leaving, Travers was stopped by the undersheriff and asked whether or not he would again interview Atchley and would permit the second conversation to be recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.559" offset="1577566">He readily agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.776" offset="1586448">Atchley had no knowledge of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.225" offset="1596270">Travers did not advise him of the inducing -- inducing course of the second conversation, that is to say the request of the undersheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.131" offset="1627930">Travers did not mention that a recording was being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.159" offset="1644022">He did not cautioned Atchley that anything he said might be used against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.838" offset="2150693">In relation to the time when he was there, the time he was on the premises where the homicide occurred and his -- his activities in going a little shed in the back of the house and coming in around the corner as his wife, the decedent, arrived home.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.895" offset="2210983">At one time, he gave a different story also as to who had the possession of the gun and keep claiming on one occasion, that she was the one who came armed.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.110" offset="2271796">We would call attention to the fact that Travers, who conducted this tape recorded interrogation, was astute, trained and cunning and that Atchley was not his peer in experience with law enforcement and investigational methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.900" offset="2342954">Although they are strong words, advisedly we will say that here is a conspiracy -- a confession coerced by conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.847" offset="2374719">A conspiracy to which the State was a party and all the more and wholly because the California constitution commands just as does the Fifth Amendment, that in a criminal case no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.623" offset="2437831">The purpose of this conspiracy seems clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.587" offset="2453713">It would be exceedingly naive to think that the undersheriff suggested a recorded conversation of any concern for the interest of the suspect, Atchley.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.570" offset="2505644">And is a fair inference that Travers too, intended to secure a confession which would in turn secure a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.963" offset="2539186">As will be later more fully developed, he presented himself to Atchley as a friend and not as the agent of the law which he had in fact become.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.835" offset="2578683">Now it may be that his original agreement to re-see and re-interview Atchley, standing alone, would not be overwhelming evidence as such an intent, but when we look to the manner of his questioning, whether it was consciously employed or from the habit of his prior conduct of such investigations as a deputy sheriff in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.370" offset="2664887">It leaves little room for doubt that he became an active agent in furthering the determination of the deputy to secure a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.780" offset="2698533">The questioning teams with leading questions and Travers was very careful to omit no relevant fact concerning a homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.659" offset="2742000">Justice Stein versus New York tells us that violence is inherently coercive and of no social value in solving crime, so it is with methods shown here.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.733" offset="2790275">Treachery and deceit they submitted are just as employed to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.610" offset="2817860">As the methods employed in Rochin versus California of innocence of justice, so do these techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.109" offset="2843773">In all of the situations, the State has so-conducted its criminal prosecution as to offend the sets of justice and in the end, to deny defendant a fair hearing in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.947" offset="2903124">The defendant is as much wronged as where -- as much wronged under the Fourteenth Amendment as where further testimony has knowingly been used to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.760" offset="2942412">The question would raised by (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="713.327" offset="2956727">In the one instance, the State has lent -- in both instances, the State has lent itself to deliberate deception, in the one case, a deception of the court and the jury, in the other case, a deception of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.545" offset="3005524">In neither instance is justice done.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.277" offset="3020466">There are impositions upon the individual other than violence which shock the sensibility and offend the conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.079" offset="3047737">And the unfairness of the State here acting as of course it must through its agents, it is submitted, is just such an imposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.485" offset="3093295">We feel that this case much resembles Leyra v. Denno in crucial errors -- areas, even though we will of course concede that in Leyra, the defendant's fatigued much more clearly appeared and that his illness was an additional fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.407" offset="3152959">As the Court will recall, that was the case where a state-employed psychiatrist by subtle and suggestive methods, continued the efforts of the police to induce the defendant who was without counsel to admit his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.202" offset="3208129">The cases differ in four particulars, but the distinctions if they have any effect, would seem to make the confession here all the more vulnerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.345" offset="3248776">First in Leyra, the New York court had recognized that the confession had been coerced and by promises of leniency and it was excluded from the jury's consideration, the question coming to this Court being with regard to a subsequent confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.352" offset="3324740">Here, the confession was placed in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.360" offset="3336861">The tape was played to the jury who were thus exposed to the impact of the defendant's own voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.070" offset="3363610">As with Omar's Moving Finger, which having rich moved on, not all such piety or wit has very naturally might have had, could ever have wiped out a lion from the minds of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.736" offset="3410317">And then they submitted that from reading -- a reading of the record is rather clearly and pathetically appears that Atchley had neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.898" offset="3446993">The second distinction is that in Leyra, it was the psychiatrist who -- to -- elicited the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.981" offset="3471339">Here, it was the defendant's own insurance agent, a former deputy sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.235" offset="3496312">Just as the doctor uses psychiatric training in bringing out the confession, so did Travers make use of his former training and experience in law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.106" offset="3543751">Moreover, it was the police who introduced the psychiatrist to Leyra.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.746" offset="3566320">Atchley himself had telephoned for Travers and he had no possible way of knowing that Travers was acting at the instigation of the police when he was questioning him.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.721" offset="3606235">Whether Leyra was or should have been suspicious and on his guard is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.219" offset="3628283">Atchley had not the slightest ground even to suspect that Travers had any connection with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.064" offset="3655659">He regarded him as his friend, there at his request and presumably, to help him.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.385" offset="3684916">Third, the record shows or rather in Leyra, the psychiatrist was on a State's payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.480" offset="3713337">Here, for all the record shows, Travers received nothing for his connivance with the officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.175" offset="3736116">To mention the difference is to destroy it for certainly, due process does not hang by so fine a thread.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.186" offset="3764120">Finally, in Leyra, it appears that threats and promises of the sort were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.158" offset="3783973">However, it does not so clearly appear that coercion -- the coercion which was found to exist, depended upon this fact alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.412" offset="3816991">As we read the case, it was because the facts were irreconcilable with the defendant's mental freedom to confess or to deny that rendered the confession obnoxious to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.179" offset="3864116">And it is submitted very naturally, had no more mental freedom than did Camilo Leyra.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.899" offset="3915003">In Spano versus New York, the undeviating intent of the police to secure from the defendant a statement which would convict him was manifested by sympathy falsely aroused.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.418" offset="3961083">There Spano, after his arrest, had employed an attorney who counseled him to answer to questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.693" offset="3986160">Spano followed this advice until Officer Bruno, a friend of his, importuned him into confessing via false stories to Bruno's being in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.424" offset="4025031">But Spano knew that his friend Bruno was a police officer and he knew too that he was making a confession of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.490" offset="4057318">Atchley had no such knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.071" offset="4071633">There is one parallel between the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.691" offset="4082186">Spano's confession was secured after he had unsuccessfully tried to see his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.867" offset="4106846">The situation does not differ here or Atchley had unsuccessfully sought to contact an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.791" offset="4138506">The ruling in Spano as the Court knows, did not reach the question of whether the confession obtained following indictment in the absence of counsel, must by -- for that reason be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.328" offset="4184691">For it was found the use of the confession was inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, so the fact that Spano may have been indicted, whereas here, Atchley had not been arraigned is of no moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.940" offset="4243101">There also appears a strong factual similarity to the case of Malinski versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.944" offset="4267133">There, the claim of physical violence was rejected and it was also found the record contained no persistent, incessant or grueling question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.084" offset="4307675">But Malinski was held in incommunicado and he was denied the right to see an attorney although he requested one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.977" offset="4335261">And he was permitted to see no friends with one exception, the friend to whom he made confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.079" offset="4359711">Our position is of course that just as Malinski's confession was a fruit of coercion, so as these petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.683" offset="4542151">His main purpose in -- in having this discussion with Travers as it appears in the record, was this matter of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.620" offset="4569840">Now, Atchley was not the beneficiary, but he was attempting to arrange the insurance claims to the one man who would handle these things for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.269" offset="4604426">Now, it cannot be denied that he knew that this was to go to the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.509" offset="4625429">That we say that it is the -- the lack of caution, a cautionary warning of some sort by Travers stands on a far different basis then would be the fact, if this were one of the undersheriffs or the district attorney, deputy as to whom Travers or Atchley had been discussing the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.810" offset="6166653">Intent on securing a confession, the police used Travers, as we have shown, the secure one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.532" offset="6313462">Reference has already been made to the fact that Travers did not caution Atchley in any way as to the use which could or probably would be made of a statement that he was giving.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.805" offset="6406562">I think as already indicated, we can assume that Atchley knew that he did not have to answer police questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.655" offset="6438013">And probably that if he did, it would -- they would kidding answers would be used against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.307" offset="7244570">Mr. Travers' testimony was that as he was terminating the first conversation, the undersheriff stopped him and he told him that they've had this conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.126" offset="7283858">It doesn't show actually whether or not he related the substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.693" offset="7294098">He testified that Atchley had told him all about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.349" offset="7324818">We believe that this can be -- that this case can be distinguished from the Crooker case, where the defendant had a college education and a law school training and knew of his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.136" offset="7367868">Now, we've already disposed of this matter of knowledge of the right not to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.148" offset="7395976">Well, Atchley had only a 3rd grade education here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.131" offset="7407888">Had and has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.557" offset="7433592">It also appears from a reading of Crooker that the acclaim of denial of due process or coercion there was based almost on -- did not almost entirely upon the denial of request for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.624" offset="7485837">But here, we are relying on additional factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.901" offset="7499003">Atchley's limited education, the repeated questioning, his lack of sleep and the fraud practiced upon him by Travers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.437" offset="7533171">Well, this Court found that Crooker had not been imposed -- had not been taken advantage of, they submitted that very face of this record shows that Atchley was the most grievously taken advantage of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.598" offset="7585729">In other standard which has been suggested by some of the cases for determining the voluntariness of a confession is to look through the strength or weakness of the defendant's will or mind and the pressures applied to his power of resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.931" offset="7651140">How did this case meet the test?</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.196" offset="7664201">In our brief, the parties have discussed pro and con, Atchley's business acumen and success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.353" offset="7692831">Yet, perhaps on reflection, this may not be such a weigh consideration of the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.043" offset="7719581">Atchley wasn't brawl beaten into a confession, by threats or by promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.930" offset="7739120">He was deceived into a confession he did not know he was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.417" offset="7753017">He thought he was arranging insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.076" offset="7763675">Theretofore by his own methods, he had resisted the efforts of the authorities to obtain a confession from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.056" offset="7795545">Once again, Spano comes to mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.524" offset="7805471">Spano resisted by following to a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.265" offset="7816443">By following his attorney's advice and refusing to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.467" offset="7833266">Atchley without the benefit of legal counsel, resisted by giving false and contradictory statements to his questioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.167" offset="7864090">He consistently resisted up to the time when he was taken in by one who he thought was acting for his best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.667" offset="7890004">That is to say he resisted those whom he knew to be against, but yielded to the pressures of one whom he thought was acting for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.354" offset="7932740">I dare say that any of us regardless of education or worldly success, similarly situated, might be similarly deceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.743" offset="7970356">But regardless of situation in life, none can breathe easily of confession obtained by these means, maybe used as the basis for a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.572" offset="8009644">And yet in another aspect, it may be the fact that Atchley was unlettered and no hardened experienced criminal, does have relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.806" offset="8046634">Being so, he would feel all the more helpless in the situation in which he found himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.789" offset="8070562">His repeated request for an attorney indicates that he knew he was not capable by himself of coping with the power of state, which was set against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.398" offset="8112985">That Atchley was then some 40 years old, that his mentality has not really appear, except perhaps inferentially from the testimony as to his limited schooling and the various menial jobs he had held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.600" offset="8165752">This -- this sheds no breaking light on whether or not his confession was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.142" offset="8187904">As we read the cases when a great weight is given to the youthful age of the defendant as in Payne versus Alabama or to his low mentality as in Fikes, such factors are considered with regard to the defendant's weakness and susceptibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.019" offset="8251434">In this light, Atchley's lack of education and his never having been -- before been charged with a major crime, do enter into the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.694" offset="8302111">Weighing Atchley's powers of resistance, as we have said which are indicated rather meekly in the record, against the weight of the fraud which was practiced on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.409" offset="8340982">It is not so difficult to find coercion is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.219" offset="8356237">It was not so much that Atchley's power of resistance was overcome as that it was circumvented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.101" offset="8379747">That the net result is the same, the methods are -- is unconscionable and the one case as in the other and both that is submitted work a denial of due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2222.748" offset="8994356">I know they appear in one of the briefs, if not in both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.377" offset="9076903">We should also like to consider the case alongside of Blackburn versus Alabama, where the defendant was probably insane and incompetent when he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.540" offset="9117550">Have put differently, his mental illness was one cause of the confession with being involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.985" offset="9151300">Here, having been duked as a result of a conspiracy between Travers and the undersheriff, Atchley's confession was likewise involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.149" offset="9184005">In the one case, it was the mental condition of the defendant created by his own illness, which prevented him from exercising his freewill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.555" offset="9213576">In the other, here, it is the defendant's mental condition as created -- created by the artifice of the State, recognizing as in Blackburn that we are necessarily dealing with probabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.029" offset="9267493">It may be that Atchley would still have confessed had he been afforded his -- all of his constitutional safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.818" offset="9298631">Ultimately, this Court of courts will determine the effect of the circumstances of Atchley's freewill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.708" offset="9326216">It is respectfully urged that it may be pertinent to a determination of this fact that repeated interrogation of one who is ignorant of his rights, cut off from his friend and denied the aid of an attorney, may be a coercive technique, if not one of intimidation or of torture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.808" offset="9406568">We feel that the methods here employed are just a sacrificial of human values as were those which were condemned in Blackburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.641" offset="9445961">The matter of a way to be accorded the decision of California Supreme Court has been -- have been discussed adequately, we believe, in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.434" offset="9477099">And -- but one short moment will be devoted to it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.259" offset="9492459">We have noted in our response that in upholding the -- the judgment of conviction, the California court did so impart upon the fact that the defendant had not suggested the recorded statements were untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.096" offset="9547734">In addition, as we did not argue in the brief, they held the -- deception practiced upon the defendant was -- was not -- did not render the statements inadmissible for the stated reason that it was not of a type reasonably likely to procure an untrue statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.984" offset="9627355">It is submitted that the decision of the state court thus shows on its face that it did in fact settle the question of admissibility by giving consideration to the probable truth or falsity of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.400" offset="9676988">A standard, which now appears clearly impermissible, was Rogers versus Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.782" offset="9698513">That being true, the state determination is entitled to little weight here and it remains for this Court on the undisputed facts of record, to weigh the case against the standards of the Fourteenth Amendment and to determine whether or not, this was such a coerced and involuntary confession as to fall without the bounds of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.190" offset="9784090">What would be the effect of a formal conviction?</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.631" offset="9797883">One result would be to lend support to the idea that the police can do no wrong, which in turn would lead to that inquisitorial system without safeguards, which was condemned in Watts versus Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.346" offset="9848769">It would portend the situation that then caused envisage when he said, “It is all right to preserve freedom in constitutions, but when the spirit of freedom has freed from -- fled from the hearts of the people, then the matter is easily enough sacrifice under the law”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.344" offset="9912717">And what if the conviction is struck down because of the mean dues to secure the confession in which it -- in so large part rests?</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.612" offset="9949811">It will place no undue burdens on the police in the proper and necessary exercise of their functions required for the protection of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.333" offset="9984711">It will merely enunciate once again the doctrine of Malinski and Spano and Blackburn and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.980" offset="10011251">That the standards of decency established by our Constitution are paramount and that in the end, illegal means are as great key dangers as -- are the miscreants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.796" offset="10050539">It is right to punish crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.706" offset="10058167">It is necessary, but some methods are more dangerous to society as we know it and more obnoxious to honest men than crime itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.545" offset="10097560">It is submitted that to condone the methods here used to obtain a confession, is to open the doors to ever widening abuses of constitutionally secured rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.932" offset="10135071">Wisely as it been said that vigilance is the eternal price of liberty, to reverse because of the method of securing Atchley's confession, would be no innovation, no new encroachment on the powers in the State of California or of any other state, in the supervision of their own criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.919" offset="10211035">It would be but another in a long line of cases, many of them sighted here today, applying a familiar rule, but in the exercise of their powers, the states are constitutionally limited by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.911" offset="10262967">It would merely delineate one more set of facts, which constitute a type of coercion banned by that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.477" offset="10297240">So far as our research is disclosed, this Court has not yet held in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.885" offset="10318869">But a confession secured by fraud, collusion or trickery, results in fundamental unfairness of equal and dignity with that caused by physical force or psychological coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.373" offset="10368815">Some of the language in Lisenba versus California indicates this might be the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.480" offset="10389295">Of course the facts in -- presented in Lisenba were held to measure up the constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.418" offset="10417089">However, we rely here not merely on a different set of facts, which appear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.859" offset="10442794">But we also say that while California may adopt any rule it elect whether or not in conforme with the federal practice, it cannot by doing so foreclose inquiry in this case, as to whether the application of the rule has worked a deprivation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.713" offset="10514265">Our position is that the fraud, collusion and deception here present, militate against -- petitioner's confession being the product of any meaningful act of volition on his part and hence, blocking the fundamental imperatives of justice required by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.098" offset="10583751">These methods are more subtle and sophisticated than the brutal use of force present in Brown versus Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.662" offset="10609977">But no one will argue that the evils at which the Fourteenth Amendment are aimed, are no longer a consequence when confessions are merely not extorted by physical violence, regardless of how they made otherwise the coerced and involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.824" offset="10674657">Mr. Oetje John Rogge, former Assistant United States Attorney, in his book, "Why Men Confess" points out that the Communists very rarely resort -- resort to physical violence in the extraction of confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.688" offset="10734111">He says if they do so, no more frequently than do the police in this country, for the reasons that these methods hadn't been found not necessary and frequently self-defeating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.517" offset="10785416">Spano tells us that the safeguards of the Constitution still obtained against these sophisticated and subtle methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.660" offset="10818017">Every step in the requirements of criminal procedure has come from the humane feelings of man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.792" offset="10838497">And as man has enlightened, has become more enlightened, laws have gradually changed and modified to conform to the -- to conform to the advancing civilizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.452" offset="10877158">They have not remained static and immutable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.149" offset="10895966">Mr. Rogge phrases this far better than I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.385" offset="10908923">He says, “The inquisitional system stands in the way of the development of equalitarian societies in the growth of human beings into mature individuals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.256" offset="10952391">Surely we haven't reached at least one -- reached that stage of civilization, where the methods shown here are apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.891" offset="10986977">To find that Veron Atchley did not have a fair trial is but to inform to the cases to which we have referred, to extend their rule to a different factual situation and to pronounce once again that our Constitution forbids a foothold to deception, brainwashing and other totalitarian device.</text>

            <text syncTime="2753.750" offset="11118320">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.731" offset="11134307">The questions discussed today are slightly different than the position taken in the petition for certiorari, which was presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.876" offset="11178924">We plea that the basic question before this Court is whether petitioner's conviction resulted from the employment of constitutionally impermissible methods by the State's law enforcement officers and hence, whether petitioner was denied due process of law into the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.848" offset="11254784">In this, the two subsidiary questions, first, was a coerced statement used at or a confession used to this trial and second, was the alleged denial of counsel sufficient to vitiate the state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.071" offset="11315702">With the Court's permission, I would like to state briefly the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.896" offset="11350915">Mrs. Atchley, the petitioner's wife, was shot and killed in her front yard in the early morning hours of August the 3rd, 1958 in Gridley, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.917" offset="11391039">Previously, she had separated from her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.938" offset="11403160">On the evening of August the 2nd, she had taken her daughter and another couple to a dance and was absent from the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.599" offset="11437746">While she was absent, at about 12:30 that evening, defendant came to the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.190" offset="11464182">He saw no one was home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.903" offset="11470973">He left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.360" offset="11472854">He searched for another places.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.756" offset="11482363">He then returned to her house with a loaded gun in his belt, parked his car a block away from her home and approached the house through the back alley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.923" offset="11527084">He remained in the shed at the side premises for a short period of time and then waited at the back end side of the house until the headlights of her car appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.164" offset="11564074">When Mrs. Atchley appeared with her car, she proceeded to the front door of her house with the keys in her hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.089" offset="11591764">Petitioner stepped around the house and confronted her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.436" offset="11605138">In the next few moments, Mrs. Atchley was shot some six times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.077" offset="11623633">Five empty cartridge cases were found, so close together, to show that the shots had been fired from a gun in approximately the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.834" offset="11662712">The victim's clothing indicated that the gun was held at least two feet from the victim at the time of the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.724" offset="11690297">Next door neighbors had been awakened during the course of this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.825" offset="11714644">They heard a woman cry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.299" offset="11720600">They observed petitioner in a stooping position shooting toward the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.477" offset="11737318">A fence destroyed their view of the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.741" offset="11758320">They inquired as to what was going on, whereupon petitioner immediately left the scene and went back to his car, secured it and drove away at fast rate of speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.606" offset="11801788">He returned to his home in Palermo where he concealed the holster and the gun used in the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.655" offset="11826030">He then went to bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.949" offset="11831150">This was approximately 3 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.800" offset="11842539">Meanwhile, the police were notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.271" offset="11848495">They arrived at the scene and petitioner was contacted.</text>
