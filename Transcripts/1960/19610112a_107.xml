            <label>Mr. Robert A. Dwyer</label>
            <text syncTime="34.653" offset="241977">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.181" offset="260054">Petitioners brought this case to this Court because -- although they never reached majority, the federal court of New York held that they were barred by the Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.758" offset="338422">This action is a wrongful death action.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.908" offset="355035">It's brought for the wrongful death of Lucia who was killed in a crash of an aircraft in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.112" offset="383770">The defendant, Transocean, owned and operated the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.013" offset="419401">Jurisdiction is based upon diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.525" offset="445524">The action was brought in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.913" offset="474990">The defendant moved to dismiss from the ground that the action that was barred by the Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.412" offset="509053">The District Court granted judgment dismissing and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.743" offset="554297">The defendant's contentions on the Statute of Limitations are roughly as -- briefly as -- as follows, "Section 13 of the New York Civil Practice Act, provides in effect of that a nonresident who brings a cause of -- brings an action based on a cause of action that arises outside of New York, is barred if they would be barred in the State where the cause of action arose."</text>
            <text syncTime="150.259" offset="704449">Section 13 expressly accepts from that provision residents of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.258" offset="736423">The courts of New York have consistently held that in effect, the purpose of Section 13 was to prevent nonresidents coming into New York, suing in New York, if at the time they sued in New York, they could not have brought the action in the State or the cause of action arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.175" offset="844048">In other words, New York courts do not merely adopt the time limit of the State where the cause of action arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.790" offset="886575">It's a mere yardstick that they apply all of the law of the other State to determine in -- in effect could this plaintiff have brought her action in the State where the cause of action arose, if they couldn't, they cannot come in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.412" offset="969017">Applying this reasoning, the District Court and the Circuit Court looked to California, the State where the cause of action arose, here.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.058" offset="1015620">They first referred to Section 340 of the California Code of Civil Procedure which provides that an action for wrongful death must be brought within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.582" offset="1085733">The Court then looked to the tolling provision in California which is Section 352 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that the Statute of Limitations shall be tolled during minority or during the time of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.489" offset="1189282">Reasoning of that -- or the defendant then urged rather that Section 25 of the Civil Code of California, applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.447" offset="1261171">They argued vastly that Section 25, which I would describe as a --a capacity statute as it existed at the time of -- of the death or the -- the time of cause of action arose here, provided that a female who was married at age 18 should be deemed an adult and should be deemed an adult person for the purpose of engaging in transactions respecting property.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.507" offset="1425429">Now, the respondent cited two cases to the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.428" offset="1453119">Two California cases that are cited in both of our briefs, the Haro case and the Caraway case, which construed Section 25 to mean that -- that this phrase engaged in transactions respecting property, gave a married female, age 18, a capacity to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.279" offset="1552488">And therefore, at 18, the disability of infancy seized and therefore, the Statute of Limitation should commence to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.598" offset="1597733">And in both cases, the Haro case and the Caraway case, which involved residents of California, the Court did dismiss because the -- in both cases, the -- the female had brought the action after she reached the age 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.796" offset="1674533">We argued -- we argued here, Your Honor, that there was two cases in California which indicated that California would not apply these cases to a nonresident, a noncitizen of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.817" offset="1762617">The cases are cited Deason against Jones and Emery against Emery.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.302" offset="1780590">In both of these cases, the California Court, in the Emery case, the California Supreme Court applied the rule of the domicile to determine whether or not, plaintiffs had a capacity to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.971" offset="1859271">Correction, in the Emery case, that was the specific (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="442.319" offset="1872645">The Deason case, the problem was a little different, but was related.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.371" offset="1884871">In the Deason case, the defendant, an infant, while living I believe in -- it was in Wyoming, obtained a court order empowering him to transact a business and to make contracts concerning that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.366" offset="1988838">He at the time was -- was 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.474" offset="2001272">Thereafter, he moved to California and prior to reaching age 21, entered into a contract in California, a real estate contract, a dispute rose over the contract and the other party of the contract brought a suit against the infant.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.952" offset="2079222">And the infant raised as a defense his infancy that he was under age 21 when he entered into the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.304" offset="2112554">The plaintiff's reply to that case, "Yes, but you were emancipated and you, in effect, are deemed an adult when you reached 18 under the order of the court of the neighboring State."</text>
            <text syncTime="518.160" offset="2175979">However, the California court refused to accept plaintiff's argument and held that matters of capacity to sue concerning infants was primarily a concern of the State wherein the infant resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.876" offset="2258840">Later, the California Supreme Court had before it, the Emery against Emery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.809" offset="2282559">In that case, plaintiffs were a wife and two daughters for bringing action against the husband's father and a son for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident in a neighboring State of California, as I recall, I believe it was Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.493" offset="2377331">But in any event, the problem -- the conflict arose in the neighboring state where the accident occurred and the injuries were sustained forbade suits among members of a family, between spouses and offspring.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.330" offset="2472730">However in California, the rule was that such suits were permitted for gross negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.881" offset="2502928">The matter came up before the Supreme Court on motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.734" offset="2534275">The defendant's motion had been granted in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.831" offset="2554650">The Supreme Court reversed fully that there again, that the question of capacity to sue was a primary concern to the state of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.412" offset="2613060">And that California should apply the rule of the domiciliary state which in the Emery case was the California -- was California and they permitted the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.704" offset="2686203">Of course, there were -- they send it back for trial as to whether or not there was gross negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.242" offset="2716296">We urge these cases and we urge them now, as clearly showing that California, if we had literally sued, brought this action in California, California courts would have permitted this suit, since California would have applied the rule of the domicile, which in this case is South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.376" offset="2816920">South Carolina, I don't believe there's any dispute about it, minority continues into age 21 -- until age 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.403" offset="2848998">And we -- we urge that the courts of California would have reasoned that their Statute of Limitations then begin to run until this widow and her infant child had reached age 21.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.533" offset="3013465">We say this, "That here, California has -- you might say granted adulthood to a female woman at age 18 because she has married."</text>

            <text syncTime="966.343" offset="3968711">In addition to the Emery case and the Deason case, we also urge that Rule 17 (b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure had a bearing on this case, this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.849" offset="4022732">17 (b), the part that we -- that is relevant here, provides that the capacity of an individual to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of his domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.858" offset="4078843">Now, we argue, Your Honor that basically, California considered the Statute of Limitations to become operative when the plaintiff in -- obtain or attain a capacity to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.439" offset="4149164">That was the reasoning in the Caraway case and in the Haro case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.181" offset="4176123">We feel that the Court should have considered this rule also as a -- as a guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.686" offset="4214157">We feel that -- that there was no necessity to -- to claim that there was a direct conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.258" offset="4240384">In fact, we -- our argument is that the California rule as to the applying the law of the domicile and the Rule 17 (b), are consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.419" offset="4293047">And in fact that the -- the court below should have avoided a conflict between the -- the local state law and the federal rule, if there was a doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.292" offset="4348531">And we say that at least, there was a doubt about what the law of California was on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.830" offset="4382699">And as I say, we -- we urge that the Deason case and Emery case clearly indicate that California would've applied the law of South Carolina to determine when the petitioners attained capacity to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.176" offset="4472038">The question that was asked as to the joint -- joint nature of the action has also brought an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.520" offset="4525432">The respondent presented to the court below two cases that are cited in both briefs, Sears against Majors and Haro against Southern Pacific, both California cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.354" offset="4580812">Involving California infants in those cases, the will brought action for wrongful death after obtaining the age of 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.907" offset="4655000">And if -- as in the -- our situation, there was also a -- an infant child surviving and in both cases, the -- the intermediate courts of California held that the action was a joint action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.595" offset="4725739">And therefore if one is barred, all are barred as was pointed out and therefore, the infant child was also barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.648" offset="4761997">Now, the court below on our case followed these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.624" offset="4785821">Now, we argued that other cases in California including a -- a case in the Supreme Court of California had applied in more recent times what appeared to us and what we urged strongly, was a different rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.388" offset="4860949">The question that brought this -- the -- the nature of the -- the jointness of this action before the Court involved the question of contributory negligence in the cases that we cite, Bowler, Bowen, Flores and Perkins, the most recent case being Perkins against Robertson, Robertson out in California in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.530" offset="4965543">And in those cases, it so happened that one of the heirs was barred by -- by reason of contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.488" offset="5005354">And the defendant raised the same issue that well, since the action is joint, if one is barred, all are barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.120" offset="5039835">And the courts in those cases, without reference to -- to Sears or Haro or the older cases, the reason that the action was joint only in the sense that all should join in the action, all heirs, the -- it was a single action, only in that a single action should be right and that the defendant should not be harassed by a series of actions by each heir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.671" offset="5158013">Only in that sense was the -- was the action, a joint action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.833" offset="5646712">We also urged in the court below that in effect, the dismissal of these actions has resulted in an abridgement of the petitioner's right -- the privileges and immunities right under the Federal Constitution Article 4, Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.025" offset="5755486">The -- this Court had occasion to consider a case of a borrowing statute very similar to north -- to New York's in 1920, the Canadian Northern against Eggen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.972" offset="5831241">It did not involve an infant, at least as far as appears from the record in that case and certainly no issue was made of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.745" offset="5862379">It so happened in that case that under the borrowing statute, the plaintiff in that case still had a year to come into the forum court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.046" offset="5903548">And this Court held in -- in effect that -- that Article 4 merely requires the State to -- to offer reasonable access as far as access to courts are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.026" offset="5959450">And they -- there -- that this Court there held that one year to come into the Court, was reasonable access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.374" offset="5992887">Our contention here is that these -- the petitioners, the widow and the child, did not have that reasonable access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.766" offset="6042415">The courts below held that our petitioner, the widow, was barred which she reached the age 19 and as I say, by reasoning that the child was also barred because it was a joint action that I think the infant child was under seven, six, five, somewhere in that neighborhood at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.959" offset="6127156">And we contend that, that was not reasonable access, that access to a court should be under conditions offering the party reasonable opportunity to -- to present his case and -- and protect itself, that the basic purpose of -- well of tolling statutes of -- and of the special protection that the courts do offer infants, they are all based on the basic idea that -- that infants are not capable of protecting themselves and looking out after their injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.232" offset="6304266">The respondent has -- has answered that by saying that, well, in New York, these petitioners could have come in at that time through a guardian ad litem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.571" offset="6365706">We say that that's still does not answer the problem there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.117" offset="6415862">And in New York, the mere fact that an infant can come in through a guardian ad litem, does not change the tolling provisions in New York.</text>
