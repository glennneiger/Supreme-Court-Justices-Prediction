            <text syncTime="12.602" offset="153788">The question involved here is whether the amount of an Industrial Accident Board's award of $1050 which the respondent appeal fixes jurisdiction under the diversity of jurisdiction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.023" offset="235499">This case arose in Texas under the Workmen's Compensation Law of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.637" offset="261935">The injured workman Horton filed his claim before the Board and the Board ruled and entered to file award allowing him 30 weeks at $35 a week.He claimed the maximum of 401 weeks but the Board allowed him 30 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.661" offset="334033">On the day of the award, the respondent filed it directly in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas seeking to set aside the Board's award of $1050 and vacating it and holding it for note, claiming jurisdiction under the diversity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.524" offset="417520">The petitioner Horton filed a motion to dismiss on the ground the jurisdiction was not present because the amount that the respondent sought to relieve itself of liability for was only $1050 and did not meet the requisite jurisdictional requirement of $10,000 exclusive of interest and cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.444" offset="517099">Subject to the motion to dismiss, the petitioner Horton filed a counterclaim, a compulsory counterclaim subject to its motion.The trial court dismissed both the main action of respondent and the counterclaim as well on the ground that no jurisdiction attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.227" offset="612289">Under the Workmen's Compensation Law of Texas Article 8307, Section 5, a party who is dissatisfied with the ruling of the Board has a right to appeal from that award to set that award aside.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.211" offset="5764263">Beg the Court's apology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.147" offset="5779937">We claim that the court below, the Fifth Circuit erred in applying a state rule for determining jurisdictional amount rather than a federal rule for determining jurisdictional amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.396" offset="5828942">As I stated, our position is a federal rule is a key to the insurer's cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.297" offset="5852557">In this connection, I would like to draw the Court's attention to the case of Booth versus Texas Employers' Insurance Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.501" offset="5885367">This is a state case which the Fifth Circuit said was controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.109" offset="5903757">Our reason for referring to this case is to show that they apply the mere rule for determining jurisdictional amount which is not based upon the claim for relief asserted by the insurance company in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.510" offset="5957360">But first of all, the record at page 43 of the Fifth Circuit's opinion, they misstate the holding of the Booth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.487" offset="5993305">At page 43 of the record, the Fifth Circuit states that regardless of who brings the suit that the Supreme Court in Texas quite logically held that the amount in controversy is the amount of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.954" offset="6043146">With deference to the Fifth Circuit, this statement is totally incorrect, with one exception, I should add.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.692" offset="6074180">Booth held that the amount in controversy in a suit by employee that says that Board's award was amount as presented in this Court petition without reference to what he had claimed before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.534" offset="6125484">Moreover, in suits by the insurance company says that the Board's award where the employee has not claimed a fixed amount before the Industrial Accident Board, the amount in controversy under the state law is the amount of the Board's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.399" offset="6189014">The Booth case at 132 Tex. 252 commented on and said their state rule for determining jurisdictional amount to rule it was implied in this case was mere logical rule in view of the other holdings that the amount in controversy is determined by a plan of court's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.046" offset="6271561">Now, again, considering what we consider to be the crux of the case upon the object of insurer's claim for relief, the respondent, in his brief, takes the position at page 1, they're seeking to be relieved of a claim liability of $14,035 asserted by court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.136" offset="6355884">In a case, as he cites on page 89 are Declaratory Judgement Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.708" offset="6386186">We feel that the respondent's position is basically trying to convert his action into a form of declaratory relief saying that he's seeking to get rid of a $14,000 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.567" offset="6429654">Our position and the reasons why we feel the plaintiff's claim in this suit only involves $1050 or as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.556" offset="6465599">First of all, the very statute which creates the state cause of action, Texas statute Article 8307, Section 5 gives the party a right to set aside the Board's award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.693" offset="6510111">It is not authorized declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.879" offset="6522859">Secondly, under the Texas statute case as construing the statute, the amount in controversy is not key to the claim before the Board with one exception with the amount involved in the court petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.843" offset="6582732">Moreover, the respondent's pleadings in this very case, he asked if the Board's award would be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.145" offset="6607914">He does not seek declaratory relief to avoid paying of $14,035 potential claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.214" offset="6640201">Moreover, the final reason why we feel that his claim only involves $1050 because it's necessary for the employee to come in and counterclaim and when he comes in and counterclaims, the amount that he will recover will depend upon his counterclaim and not what he claimed before the Board.</text>
