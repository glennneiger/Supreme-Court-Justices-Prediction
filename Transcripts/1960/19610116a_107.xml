            <label>Mr. Robert A. Dwyer</label>
            <text syncTime="12.916" offset="155042">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.829" offset="170715">I'd like to conclude my argument with a brief summary of the facts which I feel presents a very harsh result, a result that has left a three months old child without her day in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.051" offset="231528">I'd like to summarize briefly the salient facts as we see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.095" offset="251800">The father of this child died March 20, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.242" offset="272384">At that time, this child was three months of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.726" offset="290252">The wife was slightly over 16 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.043" offset="315538">The court below in dismissing this cause of action, both -- I feel both causes of action when the wife reached -- reached the age 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.975" offset="355244">At that time, this child was three years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.517" offset="377396">In fact at the present time, the child is just little over eight years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.927" offset="403101">Now, California gave that child a cause of action with the death of the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.278" offset="460466">That cause of action did not belong to the mother, it belonged to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.970" offset="491290">True, California considered it a joint cause of action but only in the sense that one cause of action should be brought by all heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.840" offset="538728">But that child nevertheless had a cause of action which has been barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.805" offset="562552">And it has been barred, I say, because that child was a citizen of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.082" offset="591705">I say that the result in this case is a clear violation of Article 4 Section 2 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.723" offset="630262">If this child had been a resident of New York, there can be no question that she's still be in court today, and she would've been heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.225" offset="672266">But because she was a resident of South Carolina, she is out of court.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="148.784" offset="698493">Why do you say there'd be no question?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_a_dwyer" startTime="151.419" stopTime="241.835">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Dwyer</label>
            <text syncTime="151.419" offset="709047">Sir, under -- under the laws of New York, if she had been a resident of New York, and had sued on the California Wrongful Death Statute, she would have had until at least age 21 to bring the action and beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.870" offset="782817">And in fact, New York has a statute for its own Wrongful Death Statute as of two-year Statute of Limitations but that only applies to the New York Wrongful Death Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.586" offset="845720">A cause of action on a Wrongful Death Statute in another State -- well, I cite a case in one of my footnotes, James against Sackman in which the federal court in New York reasoned that -- that New York would probably apply at least their six-year Statute of Limitations for causes of action based on a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.146" offset="947911">They -- they looked at the New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.629" offset="957837">They saw that the limitation period of two years on the New York Wrongful Death Statute only applied to the New York statute, and that, they looked elsewhere in the Statute of Limitations for applicable law and they held that it would be as -- at least a six-year Statute of Limitations in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.861" offset="1038817">There has been no serious dispute in the courts below as -- as to that factors, that facet of a case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="241.835" offset="1070686">Mr. Nolan, would it be that clear if the child was a citizen of California?</text>

            <text syncTime="248.083" offset="1095659">If the child was a citizen of California, our argument is based on this reasoning that the Court should've applied the rule of the domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.499" offset="1149367">If you mean the child had been a resident of California, I would say that no doubt, the California court would apply its own -- own law, Section 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.924" offset="1207045">As to the spouse, we still quarrel with the lower court's determination that the infant would be barred even in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.775" offset="1246438">We say even -- even as to one of its own residents in California, that under the more recent cases, including two in the Supreme Court of California, that the courts would no longer consider the infant barred when the mother was barred, certainly, if -- if a mother -- resident's -- if the mother in this case had been contributory negligent and have been barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.868" offset="1350823">Now, clearly under the California statute -- decisions, including two in the Supreme Court of California, that still would not have barred the child.And we say that by the same reason, the bar of the Statute of Limitations, assuming that it applied to the mother, certainly, should not have been applied to the infant.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.297" offset="2856521">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.415" offset="2889017">Petitioners and respondent are in basic agreement that the lower courts were required to apply the New York law including its conflict of law's rule and its Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.652" offset="2949935">Under the New York conflict of law's rule, any substantive right which the petitioners may have for the alleged wrongful death or their decedent, is governed the law of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.284" offset="3016495">Under borrowing provisions of the New York Statute of Limitations, this action cannot be enforced in the courts of New York if it is barred by the statutes of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.430" offset="3077099">The basic question presented to the lower courts therefore, as petitioners point out at page 11 of their brief was whether petitioners would have been barred in California if their suit had been brought there instead of in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.459" offset="3149197">Now, under Section 25, the California Civil Code, "Any female who has contracted a lawful marriage and thereafter reaches the age of 18 years shall upon reaching the age of 18 years, be of the age of majority and be deemed an adult person for the purpose of entering into any transaction, respecting property, the same as if she were 21 years of age."</text>
            <text syncTime="791.605" offset="3269778">That particular statute has been before the California courts a number of times and we respectfully submit that there were four cases directly in point, four California cases directly in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.556" offset="3329546">They are District Court of Appeal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.396" offset="3348982">They are not of this Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.475" offset="3365282">The question never got to the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.600" offset="3381791">The first of the cases that we referred to is Sears against Major -- Majors that's 104 Cal.App. 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.444" offset="3413138">It was a 1930 decision decided in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.384" offset="3428916">It involved a decedent who let him surviving a wife of full age and a son 15 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.145" offset="3459950">The Court held that since the action was barred to the mother, it was also barred to the son.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.280" offset="3488475">Now, in Haro against Southern Pacific, 17 CA 2d 594, that was in 1936 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.307" offset="3524629">This is a case are all force.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.576" offset="3537690">There, the widow was 19 at the time of her husband's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.866" offset="3558797">She left one child, who was one year old and another who was less than three months old at the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.063" offset="3595577">The action was started one -- more than one year after Haro's death but before the widow reached the age of 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.131" offset="3631940">The Court ruled that the action was barred as to the widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.529" offset="3649494">And since it was a joint action, the bar of the statute as to the widow plaintiff was also a barred to the action by the infant children.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.339" offset="3684707">I respectfully submit that is -- that is directly in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.282" offset="3700485">But what the petitioners say to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="900.980" offset="3707277">They say, "Oh, we recognize those decisions."</text>
            <text syncTime="903.829" offset="3718666">But they're asking this Court to disregard and they say they're old cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.276" offset="3736430">Well, I don't think that 1930 or 1936 are necessarily old but if they'd be old, California has answered that too and said in two other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.103" offset="3783764">And the first to those is Gates against Wendling Nathan Co. 27 CA 2d 307.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.275" offset="3812498">That was decided in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.536" offset="3825560">And in that case, I'm reading from page 20 of our brief, is what the Court said, "The further contention that the statute has not run because one of the plaintiffs is a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.707" offset="3874252">It's squarely answered by the opinion of the Court in Haro v. Southern Pacific Railroad following Sears v. Majors 104 Cal.App. 60."</text>
            <text syncTime="952.892" offset="3914898">Those are the two cases I've just referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.605" offset="3921795">Here in 1938, same California Appellate Court is risk -- is -- is making -- it's basing its decision on exactly those two cases which petitioners say are -- are old cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.199" offset="3976129">Then again, we have another, if that's -- 1938 is too late, we have another case in 1956, the case of Caraway against Burns 143 CA 2d 328.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.267" offset="4036420">Now, this was an action by a -- by a married woman for personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.944" offset="4059199">The Court ruled that her action was barred before she became 21 because as a married woman, she was of the age of majority when she reached the age of 18 years, and that her action was barred by the one-year Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.466" offset="4121266">The Court's rule was specifically based upon the Haro case which the petitioner said it's an old case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.902" offset="4146970">Here, it is again, reinstated in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.505" offset="4161390">Now, in that particular Caraway against Burns case, again the Court said and it referred to an earlier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.277" offset="4188453">It said that, "A woman of 18 years of age and being married is an adult."</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.828" offset="4214680">So that, we have the situation clearly that the woman 18 is an adult and in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.446" offset="4321155">Petitions of the appellants to have their cases heard and the Supreme Court of California were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.098" offset="4351770">In the -- in their official report in Sears -- Sears against Majors, there's a footnote showing as the -- the addendum rather showing if that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.872" offset="4386879">In the Haro case, we find that in the reference of Caraway -- Caraway against Burns which we quoted in -- in our brief on page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.699" offset="4454170">Yes, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.090" offset="4459708">See here in Caraway against Burns that the Court is saying, "The point was decided against plaintiff's contention in Haro v. Southern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.086" offset="4491682">A wrongful death action by a widow 19 years old when her husband died, instituted more than one year after his death but before she reached the age of 21."</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.408" offset="4532955">The Court held that the phrase, "transaction respecting property" in Civil Code Section 25 includes the bringing of an action for wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.336" offset="4580707">That she, therefore, was under no disability preventing her to bring the action at anytime during the year following his death and that at the end of that year, the action was barred by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.291" offset="4624488">The Supreme Court denied a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.282" offset="4636505">Appellant's attacks on this decision and her contention that has lost authority because of an amendment made in 1953 in Section 25 supra are without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.231" offset="4684257">So, to that California court obviously would've said petitioner's argument here that they were out of date which without marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.843" offset="4722709">Now, as to whether an intermediate court's opinion, rather the Supreme Court should be recognized in the case of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.268" offset="4772446">Well, this Court has said that it should in -- in Fidelity Union Trust Company against Field, 311 U.S. 169.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.277" offset="4804524">Mr. Justice Hughes in delivering the opinion of the Court said, "An intermediate state court in declaring and applying the state law, is acting as an organ of the state, and its determination in the absence of more convincing evidence of what the state law is, should be followed by a federal court in deciding a state question."</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.506" offset="6705403">Now, there was also and -- and seeing the way California, I suppose it's a community property state California or is a pioneer in that -- in that -- with that court, and they have slightly different conceptions of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.519" offset="6761409">For instance, in (Inaudible) case that cited by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.185" offset="6788159">This is a California Appellate Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.412" offset="6809057">Now, that -- that brought up this question, there -- the husband -- there was a husband and wife who were domiciled in Ontario, and they were driving an automobile in California and there was an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.764" offset="6894425">And the question that came up was whether California incidentally had a -- a rule that if one other parties was guilty of contributory negligence the -- that negligence would be imputed to the spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.667" offset="7002049">And therefore, they wouldn't -- and the reason for was that in California, a husband would have an interest in the wife's recovery, and the wife would have an interest in a -- in a husband's recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.592" offset="7069759">But there the California court looked to see what the law was in the domicile, in Ontario, and they found that Ontario didn't have any such rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.561" offset="7125661">And so, they said that therefore, they would not apply California's rule and impute to negligence of the one to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.349" offset="7164740">But the Court conceded that had they been domiciled in California, the result would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.358" offset="7184802">Now, that's what that case stands for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.995" offset="7191385">And again, I -- I submit that it does not touch upon -- not one of those three cases touch upon the problem of which -- which we are concerned here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.690" offset="7498167">I would say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.683" offset="7518124">Now, contrast with the California cases relied on by petitioners that were just referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.875" offset="7554905">There are cases, Smith versus Shepler which is a Court of Appeals case and Biewend versus Biewend, that's 17 CA 2d 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.123" offset="7615822">In the Smith case, the appellate court said, "It is true as to procedure and pleading the foreign plaintiff appearing in our courts must follow the California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.855" offset="7662843">He is subject to the period of our Statute of Limitations regardless of the period of similar statutes in his jurisdiction."</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.349" offset="7692727">And in the Biewend case, the California Supreme Court said, "It is a principle of conflict of laws recognized in California that the barring of a claim by the Statute of Limitations is a procedural matter governed by the law before them, regardless of where the cause of action arose."</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.961" offset="7791261">Now, as to Rule 17 (b), which petitioners have relied upon, it seems to me that the argument made there and of course that part of their argument is that 17 (b) first sentence, "The capacity of an in -- individual, other than one acting in a representative capacity to sue or be sued shall be deter -- determined by the law of his domicile."</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.683" offset="7938069">Well, you see that question and a diversity of cases has been before this Court on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.405" offset="7972968">And I think that was the answer to -- in Guaranty Trust Company v. York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.013" offset="7995434">And in -- not only in Guaranty Trust Company against York but there was a -- a much closer analogy to the rule question here in Ragan v. Merchant's Transfer Co., 337 U.S. 530.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.719" offset="8078294">Now, that was a -- a case that particularly brought up the --- the question of whether in a diversity case, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Number 4 was to govern or whether the -- whether a Kansas statute was to govern as to when an action was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.754" offset="8190412">Under Rule 4, an action has commenced in a District Court by the filing of a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.114" offset="8227819">And under the Kansas statute, it's commenced by the service of the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.138" offset="8263973">And in this particular Ragan case, the summons was served -- the complaint was filed before the Statute of Limitations had expired, but the summons was served after the statute had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.775" offset="8334503">And this Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas ruled that the state statute was controlling, and it also ruled that filing a complaint did not toll the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.659" offset="8398033">And let me just quote briefly from the opinion there, at page 534, Justice Douglas said, "It is argued that the Kansas statute and question is not an edictal part of the Kansas Statute of Limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.132" offset="8467937">But the Court of Appeals, on a careful Kansas -- of Kansas law has held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.992" offset="8499388">We ordinarily accept the determination of local law by the Court of Appeals, and we will not disturb it here."</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.497" offset="8533347">Now, I respectfully submit that you could really substitute the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and what they did in this Nolan case into that last paragraph, and it would apply completely and answer completely the question with respect to where the 17 (b) applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.660" offset="8622059">Now, as to last the point that petitioners raised as to the question of the constitutionality of -- of Section 13 of the New York Civil Practice Act, I just like to say that the New York Court of Appeals consider that question I think back at 1917, and rule that it was not a discrimination against non-resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.642" offset="8769912">And furthermore, in a somewhat analogous case, I'll admit there was an infancy involved but somewhat analogous case would be the Canadian Northern Railway against Eggen 252 U.S. 553, where this Court upheld that -- a constitutionality of a similar statute, similar Minnesota statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.514" offset="8861445">So, I respectfully submit that the authorities seem to be clearly against petitioners here and the Second Circuit, the District Court and the Second Circuit certainly carefully looked into New York law, carefully looked into California law before they arrived at the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.759" offset="8962382">And I submit Your Honor that is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.217" offset="11296266">So that the Caraway case involved, we say, a domicile of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.166" offset="11324061">We don't question the fact that in California, the law is fairly well settled that a domicile -- quite domiciled in that State would be barred at A -- AJP.</text>
