            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="3.712" offset="118262">Mr. Chief Justice, when the Court rose for lunch, I was in the course of discussing this request for access to the grand jury testimony of the prosecution witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.129" offset="167894">And before concluding on that, I would like to give one illustration of which seems to me to bring out the practical importance of this in the standpoint of the -- of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.840" offset="222751">I mentioned this six conversations which are about the only contemporaneous evidence that indicates -- it could be taken indicate continued membership on the petitioner's part, and one of those conversations is described in the record, Volume 1 of the big record at page 443, where the witness Gardner who is one of the three prosecution witnesses and who had been a fellow employee of the Mine, Mill and Smelters Workers of -- this witness Gardner was in Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.522" offset="365484">Travis came to Cleveland and he and Travis, the petitioner, made a trip to Canada together.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.824" offset="390666">And the conversation in the course of this trip is what is discussed in those two paragraphs, beginning the bottom of 443 and running over the top 444.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.815" offset="430582">And in that first paragraph there, it's reported that Travis has indicated that he was having trouble going back and forth across the border, because of his connection with the Communist Party and his public resignation and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.721" offset="486275">Then page 444 there, Gardner says that he asked Travis if the -- other unions are having the same difficulties and here is where the crucial part.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.268" offset="524413">He said, no, the Canadian authorities in the Maine were putting the clamps down on the left wing union such as Mine, Mill and UE.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.399" offset="552939">And we very briefly discussed his resignation from the party in which he pointed out that he believed that resignation, that public resignation, was a mistake because it gave the enemies of the party an opportunity to use that.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.748" offset="610408">And pointing out that it wasn't a true resignation from the party, but actually it was done to conform to the Taft-Harley affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.305" offset="640606">And they recognized, the enemies of the party recognized that this was not an actual resignation and in substance that is above what we discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.503" offset="673416">Well, the Court will see that the wording of that is not 100% self-explanatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.100" offset="699747">He doesn't precisely admit that he was a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.330" offset="712704">He says the enemies to the party regarded it as not a true resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.015" offset="735483">The Government, when it is describing this episode in their brief, I'm looking at page 52 of the Government's brief, summarize this episode by saying, "He”, that is Travis, “confided to Gardner that his formal resignation from the party in 1949 was not an actual resignation."</text>
            <text syncTime="177.146" offset="811969">Well, it may please (Inaudible) from the kind to begin with, the word, "formal" isn't used in there at all, he said his public resignation and when you change that into formal that is putting a very different twist in meaning on the -- on the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.252" offset="864423">He said not a word about formal resignation and he did not confide that his -- that it wasn't an actual resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.237" offset="888351">What he said was that the enemies of the party so regarded.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="202.011" stopTime="465.487">
            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="202.011" offset="911444">The Government in their brief in describing in this episode, whereas in fact what -- when he said it was public, which is really quite different in this -- in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.610" offset="941850">And this -- I say this chiefly to illustrate how important the words used in describing such a conversation maybe here.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.036" offset="971525">And why this is therefore, a particularly important instance where access to the grand jury minutes would have been valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.170" offset="1004022">Now interestingly enough, this same witness Gardner has testified about this conversation in a later proceeding before the SACB, which we quoted in our brief of page 35, and there he puts it quite differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.703" offset="1078209">He says there that he was quite convinced, that is Travis, that neither the American nor the Canadian authorities believed his resignation was genuine.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.856" offset="1114781">And as a result, he had this difficulty in getting over the boarder.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.500" offset="1129409">Well, of course to say that the American and Canadian authorities didn't regard his resignation as genuine is really not much news.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.537" offset="1157517">The fact that this prosecution was brought in the case that the Government didn't think his resignation was genuine and as you can see so forth that is very much less like an admission than the way he put it in this trial and very much less like it in the way the Government described it in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.805" offset="1222614">So as I say, I brought out the details about this conversation, because it seems to me that if there ever were circumstances where access to the minutes of the grand jury would have been useful to compare what he said about this episode there to what he said before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.993" offset="1287293">This is such an illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.109" offset="1295757">Now, I think there can be no defense of the way the trial court handled this whole matter of the request for access to these minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.404" offset="1328985">To begin with, although this Court had made it clear in Pittsburgh Plate Glass that you do not have to have a preliminary showing of inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.682" offset="1366079">The trial judge said that in his opinion, even a possible inconsistency was not enough that it had to be an inconsistency going to the basis of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.427" offset="1417070">Then, when the petitioner's counsel tried to particularize further the possible need for this testimony and endeavored to question the witnesses about what they had talked about before the grand jury and whether they had described these conversations, the trial judge cut him off and would not allow that line of testimony -- of questioning to be pursued, so that there he was very much hampered in efforts to show by examining the witnesses that there might be need for access to the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.750" offset="1542353">And then finally, both the trial court and the prosecution simply took a blanket position of opposition to any and every request for any grand jury testimony, no matter how limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.253" offset="1592404">As I read the Government's brief, it doesn't seem to me that they have made any very serious effort to defend these rulings in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.089" offset="1631692">The main burden of their brief on this point is that if it should be ruled that there was an abusive discussion here and a reversal on that ground, they ask that this Court not lay down any absolute rule, any rule of absolute right to access to minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.969" offset="1703267">Well, what they call, they don't want to rule an automatic disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.058" offset="1723643">We have not asked here for any such rule of automatic disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.437" offset="1741093">In our brief, we have tried to analyze the factors that should come into play in handling a request for grand jury testimony, what should be considered and what shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.448" offset="1777142">And what the differences are between the grand jury problem and the 3500 problem, they aren't on all force in a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.381" offset="1808906">But far short of any rule of automatic disclosure, it does seem to us that in circumstances such as this case presents, where the crucial evidence is discussions to which nobody but the witness and the defendant were purvey, where the wording of these -- of these descriptions of the conversations is in importance, that there is no sound reason why the minutes should not be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.434" offset="1917158">And as I said earlier, in the Second Circuit, there is a whole line of decisions that would clearly cover a situation like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.626" offset="1949863">And it seems to us that the practice of the Second Circuit is sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.487" offset="1965328">Now the Second Circuit decision would not go beyond the situation that this goes to the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="470.531" offset="1985494">Beyond it?</text>
            <text syncTime="473.370" offset="1996884">Perhaps, the best answer Mr. Justice Harlan will be to read one paragraph from this last decision, which is in the Hernandez case decided in August.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.270" offset="2036485">That was a narcotics case and the witness for the Government was an agent of the Bureau of Narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.956" offset="2067205">And described a conversation with the defendant in which the defendant had referred to another person as one of his suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.261" offset="2104404">Alright, it's very much like this case, because it's just such a conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.170" offset="2124048">The Court says and this is a per curiam opinion, Judges Clark, Waterman and Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.827" offset="2146722">The Government's case rested largely upon new Newkirk's (ph) testimony, so that any doubts cast upon his credibility by a variance between such testimony and that given before the grand jury, undoubtedly, would have influenced the juries liberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.136" offset="2199907">It was thus incumbent upon the trial court to inspect the minutes as requested by the defendant in order to ascertain whether any material inconsistencies existed.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="533.028" offset="2235434">All of that would have automatically (Inaudible) automatically comply an exam to this new witness irrespective of (Inaudible) declare.</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="543.395" offset="2276916">I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.214" offset="2280260">They have never said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.264" offset="2288410">That the practice as a matter of fact now, has become pretty standard there, and as I indicated before the U.S. Attorney's office there now often turns over the minutes voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.534" offset="2337520">It seems to us that a lot of trouble in this field is caused by a sort of automatic attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.055" offset="2355597">If the -- if the Government automatically resists every request for testimony, you get these questions precipitated, when there is no -- really no good reason why the testimony shouldn't have been looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.903" offset="2407006">May I then turn to the matter -- to some of the other matters that our petitioner seeks to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.296" offset="2432606">And the next few, I'm going to speak very briefly about the matter of the perjury rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.940" offset="2455176">That the rule requiring either two witnesses or one witness plus corroboration on the falseness of the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.205" offset="2488195">The Government says that rule is not applicable here because this is not technically a perjury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.276" offset="2508466">Now, as I indicated before, this question was up in the Gold case.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.740" offset="2526333">It was briefed then and although I didn't hear argument, I assume it was a full argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.964" offset="2547231">And I'll be frank to say that having read the briefs in that case, I do not think that we have been able to add very much to what was said on behalf of the petitioner there and I don't think the Government has been able to add much to what the Government said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.003" offset="2607417">And for that reason, I would refer not to take the Court's time to go over all these considerations that must be pretty familiar by now.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.385" offset="2656946">This point was dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.890" offset="2662902">This was a point of Judge Murrah's dissent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.574" offset="2673664">In the Gold case, Judge Bazelon expressed himself to the effect that perjury rule should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.562" offset="2697592">It seems to us the Government's position is over technical, that this is, in all essential respects, like a perjury trial, and that there is no good reason why the same requirements shouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.823" offset="2746702">To be on that, I would further rely on our brief on what is said there.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.463" offset="3289213">I don't -- I don't think that's quite accurate Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.477" offset="3301230">We have found some cases there where it's applied in proceedings related to bankruptcy, which are not technically perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.755" offset="3330382">We have looked high and low for cases under the false claims -- false statement statute, because of course, that's where we hope to find it, but question doesn't seem to have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.499" offset="3373328">Now, what's actually happened to a lot of these trials, I cannot say.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.068" offset="3391613">But the only cases that it has been thoroughly pursued by the lower courts have been on these 9 (h) cases, and there's division of opinion among the circuit judges on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.593" offset="3433723">Policy considerations seem to me, have been pretty well explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.278" offset="3456502">On the evidence, once again, I would like to restrict my argument to one of the -- of the evidentiary points here.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.903" offset="3499029">We do complain quite seriously of rulings that restricted the cross-examination, but I think, everything is well covered in the brief as I can hope to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.610" offset="3537795">The thing I would like to talk about appears in our brief at page 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.926" offset="3551065">It's this expert testimony that I referred to earlier in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.159" offset="3567992">It was given by the witness Eckert and the testimony is set forth there at page 51 of our brief, where Eckert is asked based upon his experience and his membership and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.105" offset="3615744">Whether there was a party policy on resignation from the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.298" offset="3636537">He said, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.017" offset="3639463">And then was asked to state the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.196" offset="3648136">The policy of the party was that once having joined the Communist Party, you could not leave without being expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.187" offset="3680110">Now, that evidence was offered by the Government and was used by the Government before the jury to try to convince them that since there was such a party policy, that Travis' public statement of resignation could not have been bona fide.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.293" offset="3740505">It must have been phony because it was out of accord with his party policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.587" offset="3769762">May I say in a preliminary respect that the Douds case, in which these provisions were upheld, was very explicitly based on the assumption that you could avoid the requirement of this statute by resigning from the Communist Party and remaining an officer of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.290" offset="3844577">So that a rule of -- I mean, accepting this evidence for the purpose for which it was offered, would seem to make it pretty impossible to resign and comply with what said in the Douds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.573" offset="3897657">It would almost mean that once in, you were in for good and there was no effective way of getting out so that you could continue your union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.051" offset="3927542">The Government does endeavor to make a more limited justification for this testimony by saying that it is relevant to the petitioner's own state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.920" offset="3979055">That if it is a fact that he had been a Communist for several years and if it is a fact that there is such a party policy, this would indicate that his frame of mind when he resigned was not a sincere frame of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.303" offset="4036629">That he was doing a phony act.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.009" offset="4051362">If one assumes that the testimony might bear such an inference, it nonetheless seems to me very clear that you could not use the testimony that way, unless it were shown that the petitioner knew of this policy and felt bound by it, that he subscribed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.373" offset="4136835">And with that in mind, the petitioner asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that in weighing this testimony on the -- this expert testimony on party policy, that they should disregard it unless they were satisfied that Travis knew of this policy and subscribed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.994" offset="4211336">The trial judge refused to so instruct and he made what seems to me, a bad matter worse by then affirmatively instructing the jury that they could give such weight as they saw fit to this expert testimony, without questioning them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.808" offset="4274552">That if Travis didn't know anything about it of course, that it shouldn't be binding on it, so that we complain of that --</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="1058.092" offset="4335783">It is possible that he couldn't have known about it and still not agreed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.833" offset="4350725">He could have known about it and said I'm going to defy it and resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.920" offset="4363055">All these things are possible but certainly, if he didn't know anything about it at all, the fact that there was such a policy couldn't be used as showing what his state of mind about his resignation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.851" offset="4410807">And all we wanted was for that be made clear for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.887" offset="4422928">That unless it was shown that Travis had some knowledge of this supposed policy that it shouldn't be held against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.370" offset="4452812">Now furthermore, our other complaint is that in fact there is absolutely no evidence that he knew about this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.408" offset="4481024">The trial court seemed to think to the fact that he had been a member of the party was sufficient proof that he knew of this policy but that, under many past rulings, is not a proper inference, the mere fact of membership would not establish that he knew of the particular policy like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.016" offset="4551450">Then the Court of Appeals seemed to think that because he did know about the party's policy on compliance or noncompliance of the Taft-Hartley Law, that maybe this shows that he knew about the non-resignation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.512" offset="4609442">But there again, I don't think you can infer a knowledge of one policy from the fact that he knows another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.923" offset="4631071">So that we say that there was no evidence tying this suppose policy of petitioner and that even if their had been some evidence, we were entitled to a cautionary instruction here that -- to straighten the jury out on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.456" offset="4713200">I would like to speak of one more thing before going to the motions for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.532" offset="4733471">We have here two problems under the Jencks statute, 18 U.S.C. 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.198" offset="4764191">There are two quite distinct problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.192" offset="4772133">I think they're both quite simple and I'm at a loss to know why the trial court encountered so much difficulty in coping with them that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.367" offset="4804838">The first of these problems relates to the handling of documents which were in the possession of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.117" offset="4843813">The prosecution in other words, had these FBI reports, conversations with the -- with the Government witnesses, but there was question about some of them, as to whether they were statements within the meaning of 3500 (e), maybe they weren't sufficiently verbatim, maybe they had some other effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.440" offset="4921135">In any event, the prosecution had these statements and they began to embark on the policy that this Court approved in the Palermo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.463" offset="4961259">That is to say, if they had doubt about particular statements, they wanted to submit it to the trial judge in camera, so that he could determine whether or not, it was a statement with the unmeaning of 3500 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.463" offset="5009220">The trial judge inexplicably, to my way of thinking, ruled that he would not rule under 3500 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.943" offset="5047150">He said his only function was in 3500 (c), that if the Government brought him a statement, he'd examine it to see if it contained irrelevant material and then he would excise the irrelevant material under the 3500 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.717" offset="5102216">But he would not make any determinations as to whether it was or was not, a statement within the meaning of 3500 (e).</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.005" offset="5235440">It was tried before that, I'm told, but the Government, nonetheless, is prepared to go down this path and to submit them for in camera examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.795" offset="5266578">The trial court said, no, don't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.127" offset="5275878">Don't bring in any documents unless you are prepared to assume that they are statements under 3500 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.212" offset="5300224">Then I will approve them for irrelevant portions, but I won't look at them to determine whether they fall within 3500 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.917" offset="5331048">And having said that to the Government, the Government said, alright we'll then have to reappraise our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.344" offset="5352782">And so far as the record shows they thereafter brought in only those documents which they thought were clearly 3500 (e) and not those which they otherwise would have brought in for in camera inspection to determine whether or not they should be turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.416" offset="5417044">Now that's one point which relates entirely to documents that were admittedly in the prosecution's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.142" offset="5443897">Of course, we do not know whether in fact, they would have qualified under 3500 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.116" offset="5463855">Since they weren't produce at all, they are not sealed and delivered up here so that this Court can't look at them either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.529" offset="5493530">We do have the sealed excisions of irrelevant matter from the statements that were turned over, but we don't have the doubtful statements that might or might not have been produceable under 3500 (e), they never came.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.446" offset="5549119">Our other point under 3500 relates to the possibility of there being other statements that the prosecution did not know about but could find out about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.221" offset="5600214">The prosecution witnesses had testified in other proceedings and they, under cross-examination, said, yes, before their testimony and these other proceedings they have talked to government agents, government attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.267" offset="5656430">Also, one of them had talked to a Senate Committee investigator when he was down on some other proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.387" offset="5684955">The request that the defense made for these statements was broad enough to comprehend and specifically was intended to comprehend any statements that might have been made in the course of these interviews with government attorneys, Senate Committee investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.811" offset="5754650">The Government took the position that 3500 does not cover Senate Committee agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.287" offset="5780564">And the Government further took the position that it was not responsible to make inquiry to other government attorneys to see if they had produceable statements under 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.809" offset="5826644">It's quite clear on the record that the prosecuting attorneys said, I'm not -- I don't know what other government attorneys may have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.963" offset="5983274">More broadly, I think it was his position that all he had to do was to find out whether the witness has made statements to the FBI, to make inquiry in Washington for whatever they might have and that was the end of his responsibility in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.330" offset="6056730">And he talked about how he couldn't be responsible for what other government attorneys might have done and he didn't see how the Court could ask a Senate Committee to turn over documents and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.312" offset="6120573">They never did require the prosecution to find out whether there were any such statements in the hands of Senate Committee or other government attorneys and the prosecution was never made to explore the thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.247" offset="6588374">We have one other point about the trial which I wish -- I would've otherwise liked to talk about, but I think I'm going to pass over the point relating to the instructions on membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.005" offset="6639365">Let me just state briefly that the point of our complaint is that in the charge the jury on membership, the indicia of membership as set forth in the Communist Control Act of 1954 were used, were stated to the jury as basis from which membership where -- as things to be considered in determining whether or not he had remained a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.465" offset="6745213">The Court at the moment has the SACB case which was argued in October, in which the constitutionality of those indicia comes up in quite a different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.017" offset="6783457">That is there constitutionality or not, in terms of the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.187" offset="6812087">Here you have the question whether those indica can validly be used as instructions to the jury in a criminal case involving the issue with membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.921" offset="6851062">And we say that in the first place, we complain about the fact that instead of -- if you're going to give the indicia at all, it seems to me you should have given all of it, but you didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.358" offset="6892753">But we do complain about the indicia themselves on the ground that they are so vague and so sweeping that they cannot validly be used as the basis for a jury determination on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.505" offset="6949386">All that is we set forth in our brief, I hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.684" offset="6966105">Now, I then, deal with cases 3 and 71, the motions for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.442" offset="6993168">And may I say quite frankly that No. 3 is by far the more important of two, it is doubtful whether No. 71 would have been made, except for its cumulative interests coming on top of the motion in No. 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.398" offset="7057011">The motion No. 3 concerns the same witness Gardner, whose conversation used from another connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.836" offset="7082715">And Gardner also testified in a case in Cleveland, in a federal court in Cleveland, the West case, which is a case involving a conspiracy to make false affidavits under Taft-Harley Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.019" offset="7143424">That case is pending on petition for certiorari here at the moment and not yet acted on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.832" offset="7170696">And in that case in Cleveland, Gardner was asked whether he had had any military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.438" offset="7205073">And he replied with the flat denial that he'd been ever in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.341" offset="7224717">The attorneys in the West case then wrote to the Government to make inquiry and the result of their inquiry, you'll -- the Court will find at page 3 of the record in No. 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.423" offset="7277066">The Department of Justice wrote back saying that inquiry now disclosed that the he had served in the Armed Forces from 1922 to 1925 and the course of which he was absent on -- without leave and he was court-martialed and confined at hard labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.998" offset="7339342">He then reenlisted in 1925, I beg your pardon, in January 1926 and had then deserted on May 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.408" offset="7376959">And so, he had a somewhat lengthy and checked military history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.961" offset="7407261">The false -- the false answer on his ties into another thing which is referred to at page 4 of the record and that is the FBI report which was furnished to the defense now in this case, in the Travis case, under 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.387" offset="7480926">And the essential facts of which were at the top of page 4 there that he had no military service and that he'd been employed by the DuPont Chemical Company from 1925 to 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.201" offset="7528155">The discrepancy on that date, a check revealed that he went to work there in 1926, not 1925 and the mistake on that date of course, exactly coincides with the year 1926, when he in fact deserted from the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.858" offset="7594820">Now, admittedly, these matters are not directly on the issue of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.147" offset="7620002">They could be described as being collateral in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.147" offset="7631914">And the Government says that they provide no basis for a new trial for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.701" offset="7662216">We think that the decisions in (Inaudible) and other cases have -- well, they haven't eliminated at all the question of collateral -- collateral proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.395" offset="7704952">They do indicate that under some circumstances, collateral evidence which is destructive of the witness' credibility, maybe the basis for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.923" offset="7751032">And this again, I think must be viewed in the light of the kind of case this is, where really the only direct evidence we have to go on are these conversations to place the time in the affidavits and Gardner's version of what those were, coupled with the fact that has admitted hostility to this union of this defendant and that his credibility became a vitally important matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.490" offset="7845282">Well now, this is certainly very damaging to his credibility and we think would have been a vital -- might have been a vital impact on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.382" offset="7888854">The Government makes one other argument here in the West case itself when this test -- this information was uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.508" offset="7917380">They made a motion for a new trial in the West case, which was denied and the denial of that motion is one of the grounds for certiorari which has been urged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.037" offset="7955519">The Government says, the West case has therefore -- the judge there has waived this and found it insufficient as the judge did in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.641" offset="7997942">But the two things are not -- are not on the same bottom here, because in the West case when they held -- they'd had their hearing on a motion for a new trial, it was brought out that one of the defense attorneys in the West case had known about Gardner's military service at the time he testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.617" offset="8081847">Therefore, says the trial judge, it's very unlikely that Gardner testified deliberately falsely because he knew that this defense attorney knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.730" offset="8114343">He probably thought the question was directed only to World War II in which he didn't serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.895" offset="8134928">And therefore, we don't think he deliberately falsified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.261" offset="8152377">Well that explanation might have been all right in the West case, but it obviously doesn't fit the fact that in this case, we also have the FBI report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.954" offset="8187173">He certainly wasn't called into any error on that because of presence of -- the presence of the defense attorney and the fact that the dates of employment are falsified in exactly the right way to cover up the year of his desertion, is further a very strong evidence that this was deliberate falsification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.088" offset="8263764">So we say for all those reasons, the motion in No. 3 was sufficient grounds for a new trial, the motion in No. 71 is based on other discrepancies in Gardner's testimony about the time of his marriage and divorce, which standing by themselves, wouldn't have supported the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.659" offset="8330010">But they do accentuate the impression that you get from the motion in No. 3 that this -- there's a man who was capable of a very deliberate and extensive falsification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.821" offset="8390614">Mr. Chief Justice with the Court's permission, I'll reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2093.032" offset="8475460">Because Mr. Taylor spoke first on the venue point, I shall cover it, but briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.056" offset="8527600">If the petitioner had not mailed or caused to be mailed, the letter in Denver containing these affidavits, they wouldn't have been filed to the Board in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.518" offset="8625403">He acted, we think, in Denver to produce a result in effect in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.703" offset="8666154">He started a force going that ended up in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.233" offset="8692276">Now, the Lombardo case is what the offense was the failure to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.994" offset="8727385">And while petitioner's scarce at the distinction -- I think we can't overlook at the fact, there is a difference between action and inaction and between malfeasance and nonfeasance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.988" offset="8791333">If you're required to file something at a given place and you never do it, you don't do it on the appointed date, the courts haven't pushed any rule to the point of saying that you commit a failure in your home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.941" offset="8887150">That was an argument the Government made in Lombardo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.866" offset="8910869">But there have been a great number of cases in which false statements had been mailed from distant points to Washington and the offense has been held subject to prosecution in the district of the mailing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2249.436" offset="9101145">Now there are some cases cited in the briefs where men made a false affidavit or a false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.768" offset="9142418">In New Jersey, let's say, and then took it across the river, filed it in a government office in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2276.253" offset="9208351">And the Court held in those cases and I think correctly that the place of filing was the only possible jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.670" offset="9270000">But here, neither the Lombardo case nor any other case that I know, says that false filing and non-filing are in the same category.</text>

            <text syncTime="3673.609" offset="14797824">Travis came and I think John Clark, the president of the union, came to Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.816" offset="14838680">Gardner went over there from Buffalo and drove them in his car across the Canadian border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.784" offset="14886536">Then later, I don't know where Clark went, Travis and Gardner drove back alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.203" offset="14928227">And it was then that the conversation took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.876" offset="14942856">Now at that time, Gardner was a member, an active member, of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.809" offset="14982562">And it was in that context that the conversation occurred, which Travis told Gardner that he started out by calling him, "You come with excellent recommendations from the Communist Party in Cleveland."</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.947" offset="15095202">I don't know why the Communist Party in Cleveland would recommend one of their members to a non-member in another city, but that is one little brick, I think, in the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.329" offset="15172733">Then, there was the testimony that Gardner -- that Travis said that he realized that his public resignation had been a mistake because some enemies, he gave the enemies of the Party, in outcome, they are pointing out that it wasn't real.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.547" offset="15265520">We think the jury could infer from that that Travis meant two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.856" offset="15294777">One, that his resignation was not really bona fide; and two, that Travis was a member of the Communist Party; he was talking as one Communist to another in the fall of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.760" offset="15362382">Now, the jury could relate that back to Eckert's testimony that in 1948, at a meeting in his home which was then in Chicago.</text>

            <label>Mr. George B. Searls</label>
            <text syncTime="4381.516" offset="17629393">But I don't think, under the instruction of the Court that evidence prejudice -- had any real chance of prejudice in the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.982" offset="17675264">Now, I like to go to one more thing and that is, the jury could also take into account, the conduct of the defendant -- of the petitioner before 1949 and during the period 1952 and 1953, in which -- during which times, he was acting as an active member of the Party and as one of the leaders of the Party in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.213" offset="17820191">Now, in March 1952, he had a conversation with Mason, I think, in which about some proposal which the Communist in Russia had made or the Russian delegation to some convention in Europe, that a third federation of labor be set up in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.097" offset="17931786">The term was used the expelled unions by which I take it to mean, the unions like Mine Mill, which ultimately was cast out of the CIO, and I gathered there were probably some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.047" offset="18007542">Travis was the man selected apparently by the Party to pass -- discuss that matter with the members or the leaders of the union and to report back to the French Communist who was delegated to receive the news.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.264" offset="18100433">Then in 1953, Travis was apparently important and active in both the Party and the union, because according to Mason's testimony, Travis had to say as to what went on the agenda at the annual staff conference of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.360" offset="18224776">And it was at that time that Travis made the statement in regard to apply to something Mason said that "when they get us Communist, they will be after people like you."</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.113" offset="18295829">Later in 1953, Gardner who was still a member of the Party was transferred by Mine Mill from Cleveland to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.575" offset="18373674">He was instructed on his way west to stopover at Denver to be briefed by Travis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.983" offset="18415261">And Travis told him that there was a serious factional dispute in the Party going on in the District in Idaho to which he was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.596" offset="18457788">And until that dispute was resolved, he was to refrain from any active party activities in the district to which he was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.247" offset="18508361">Now, that suggest that at that time, Travis was not only a member of the party, but was at a position of authority in it so that the man who didn't -- who was an employee of a union, could be instructed to stop over and see him and get his instructions from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.188" offset="18600103">Now, then in 1953 later, Mason complained to Travis about the tactics of Travis and what Mason called, his party watchdogs, in regard to a -- some collective bargaining that was going on in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.018" offset="18695398">And he said that he spoke to -- he told Travis that, "I am speaking to you as the leader of the Party in the union."</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.736" offset="18738343">Again, later on they had another conference and Mason says that he discussed with Travis, Travis' party activities, as leader of the Party forces, meaning in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.260" offset="18832384">And that during that discussion, Travis said "Well you and Joe, Mason's brother, had your chance, you were invited to join the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.744" offset="18882330">Had you done so, you would be sitting high in the council of this organization with us."</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.157" offset="18912005">Now, we submit that on that evidence, taking it all together, the jury could find, there was a continuous course of Party activity of such a nature as to justify the inference that Travis, in the one narrow period, which hasn't been covered by evidence, 1950 and the part of 1951, that Travis was a member throughout there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.469" offset="19057246">He only claimed he resigned in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.496" offset="19069367">He never made any claim that he resigned at any other date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.178" offset="19092041">And we think that the evidence brackets the affidavit dates, December 1951 and December 1952, so that the jury could properly find that he was a member of the Party on the date when he signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.253" offset="19204368">Your Honor, I urge with the permission of the Court, I should like to leave to our brief the argument on what is claimed to be errors in the admission or exclusion of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.680" offset="19262046">Mr. Taylor paid very brief attention to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.663" offset="19285974">And I think our position is adequately set out there --</text>

            <text syncTime="4804.043" offset="19319515">-- and I want to come to another factor of the case which I regard as more important matters, the question of the production of the grand jury members.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.726" offset="19406242">Our position is that whether it's for purposes of production direct to the defense or for purposes of in camera inspection, the trial court has discretion in handling a motion for either or both of those forms of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.480" offset="19517315">And I think to judge whether the trial court here abused its discretion, we have to read the record carefully because well I would almost say, there are as many pages of argument and colloquy in chambers on this subject and related subjects as there are of testimony in court in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.226" offset="19632253">It was explored extensively and you can't rest on any one statement, either by the trial court or by a counsel for the defense or by the United States attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.729" offset="19702262">Position shifted a little bit as the trial went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.036" offset="19747506">Now, we say that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion and we have several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.826" offset="19774673">The first reason is that plaintiff's motions for production, except in possibly one or possibly two instances, were too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.651" offset="19857951">Plaintiff's briefs, despite speaks in terms of a request for the minutes of the grand jury testimony, which is the way in which one would speak or write of a request for the minutes of the jury which returned the indictment, which is on trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="4970.582" offset="19985742">What he started off by saying was he wanted transcript with respect to Eckert, of his testimony before any grand juries and he named a number of cases in which Eckert had testified and he wanted transcript before any of those juries, only two of which were in the District of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.112" offset="20123773">That ties up with what Your Honor just said about these grand juries, that's on page 424 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="5012.716" offset="20154284">At that time, I think counsel had not modified his previous motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.467" offset="20185213">So he was still asking for the testimony of all the grand juries before which, it could be found out, that Eckert had testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.599" offset="20237772">Now, later on, he did modify his request.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.949" offset="20279150">He came down, this is on page 425 of the record, to a request for the transcript of Eckert's testimony before three grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.926" offset="20343097">Before the grand jury that indicted Travis in 1954, before the grand jury which indicted Travis and 13 other people for another -- and another -- for another offense in 1956, and for the Travis' testimony before the grand jury in the Gold case which was here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.916" offset="20455006">Now, as to Mason, the motion was for any grand jury testimony this witness has given and is -- I am not entirely sure, but I think, it was at that time that counsel for the defendant said, the United States attorney has told me he's testified before a number of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.484" offset="20569318">I think that was in connection with Mason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.916" offset="20583006">Now as to Gardner, there was also originally, a motion for a test -- production of testimony before any grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.260" offset="20652387">There's also one time where the counsel attempted to question Gardner about his testimony or whether he had testified in the 1956 grand jury hearing as to each of the 19 -- of the 14 defendants, named in the 1956 indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.091" offset="20759698">He finally came down, however, as with respect to Gardner to a request to examine his 1956 grand jury testimony as to two episodes of Canadian trip, which I have mentioned and the talk with Travis in Denver when Gardner was on his way to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.453" offset="20917164">Now, the court -- there's been some discussion argument in the briefs as to whether the court sustained improperly questions as to examination before grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.871" offset="20990830">I think in a great many instances that was sustained, where it was a testimony before another grand jury than the one which returned this indictment in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.248" offset="21056345">I might also point out that it is clear that what the defense was looking for was not the ordinary case of the -- as I advised, we expect of moving to see the grand jury minutes in the grand jury which indicted the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.380" offset="21176926">But in most of his request, were addressed to all, as many as grand juries as he could think of.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.859" offset="21218826">Now, I think that all the instances cited in plaintiff's brief on page 32, of -- objections being sustained to questions asked witnesses as to testifying before grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.554" offset="21317569">I think, all the items listed on in that refer to the 1956 grand jury, which had indicted Travis for another crime and indicted 13 other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.214" offset="21376188">Now that case, at that time, was still pending, according to a statement in the record here, in the District Court of Colorado on a motion to dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.779" offset="21422477">It hasn't apparently even reached the trial stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.214" offset="21484231">Now, I understand that it is implicit in this Court's decision in Palermo possibly, in some other decisions that to get grand jury minutes or even perhaps to have the judge look at them in camera, the defendant has to show a need.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.888" offset="21626964">Now, perhaps the reason defendant's counsel was asked more questions, that it seems to me, about the 1956 grand jury and about the 1954 grand jury was that he has in his hands transcripts of the testimony of Eckert and Mason at the first trial of the petitioner which took place in 1955 and which -- of which he may have very little use in any attempt to show inconsistencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.444" offset="21813164">Now, as to Eckert, he had also transcripts of some six other proceedings or hearings in which Eckert had testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.273" offset="21864469">They're listed in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.140" offset="21875963">And as to Mason he had an addition to the 1955 transcript, transcript of his testimony in an NLRB hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.012" offset="21927372">Now, we usually need something that we don't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.972" offset="21951300">And in this case, he did have transcripts of the testimony at the first trial of Eckert and Mason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.634" offset="21981915">Gardner did not testify at the first trial or in the 1954 grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.218" offset="22016293">And the only inconsistencies that he showed were of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.816" offset="22054640">He'd asked Eckert, “You testified in the Gold case in the District of Columbia, did you not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.202" offset="22132172">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.386" offset="22096959">“Did you tell about this 1948 meeting where the Communist policy on not signing Taft-Hartley affidavits was set?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.249" offset="22148368">“In your transcript -- in the transcript of the testimony -- your testimony in the Gold case, you did not mention that James Durkin was at that meeting, did you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.834" offset="22198732">“No, I didn't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.513" offset="22205419">“Why didn't you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.998" offset="22207404">“Well, I just didn't happen to think of him at that time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.540" offset="22221511">Now, he -- there are a large number of such so-called inconsistencies; none of them, however, relate to Travis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.644" offset="22265919">There was no pointing out that did he had ever testified in any other hearing or proceeding that Travis was not at a meeting to which he was -- he testified in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.564" offset="22325582">There was no testimony that he ever omitted Travis' name.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.245" offset="22348361">Most of these meetings were of a sizable number of people and in a number of cases, Eckert said something like there were a large number of people there and a number of people that, then he listed name and that's all I can remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.625" offset="22417847">In no instance I think, was he -- where the cross-examiner able to show that he had -- Eckert had previously said that Durkin, for example, was not at a particular meeting when he -- and said later on that he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.354" offset="22492766">It was just a matter of omission or is not of a matter of contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.029" offset="22555460">As I have just been pointing out full cross-examination of the plaintiff's -- of the plaintiff's witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.692" offset="22590151">The defense had a large amount of material even without any grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.983" offset="22627349">Now, there was -- Mr. Taylor made a remark about the trial court said that you have to show some rather definite -- I'm quoting, "certain likelihood of material contradiction to get the grand jury minutes."</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.141" offset="22727973">And that that is not in accordance of what this Court said in Palermo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.220" offset="22748244">He did not mention, however, that at the trial, the defense counsel said, "I agree with the Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.938" offset="22799130">Also, defense counsel suggested that the burden on the Court of examining all these minutes would be too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.430" offset="22853047">And we think that the district judge was not unreasonable in refusing to examine the testimony of these witnesses in maybe six or eight other grand jury hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.762" offset="22938415">When the defense had a large number of transcripts available to it and when there was no showing of real need, we think it's a matter of discretion and the trial court had a difficult time with all of motions that were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.748" offset="23058369">As the case in the Second Circuit, as we read and they do not hold, there is no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.047" offset="23087522">I mean in -- even while they're going to look at it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.769" offset="23106435">In the Zborowski case, the Court examined the record and the evidence in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.326" offset="23132662">They discovered reasons why the trial court should have examined the record and it found them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.835" offset="23162755">In the McKeever (ph) case, it said there had to be some reason for supposing that there is inconsistency between the trial testimony and the grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.140" offset="23231927">In fact, I'm not at all sure what the Second Circuit rule is because I think you will find that the trial judge, who was reversing the Hernandez case to which Mr. Taylor referred, was the circuit judge who wrote the opinions in the Zborowski and McKeever case, so that apparently, the rule is not too clear even there.</text>

            <label>Mr. George B. Searls</label>
            <text syncTime="5880.826" offset="23626689">No, I think he took into account all these factors that I've mentioned, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.216" offset="23656260">Of course, when we got there and must remember that there are three minutes -- I mean, three witnesses in three different sets of grand jury minutes that were being called for, and what I have said my not necessarily come out with the same corroboration in each instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.673" offset="23750092">Now, a related part of the argument is that whether the trial judge committed error in its rulings on Section 3500 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.688" offset="23830131">Now, I say that's related, because you will find through the record that the cross-examination of witnesses on whether they had testified before grand juries or not, it's intermixed with the examination of witnesses as to whether they had given statements to agents of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.054" offset="23943607">There's one instance -- I think it's page 6 -- I think it's referred to in the defendant's brief in one -- no, if I may -- may go back for a minute to the grand jury, defendant's brief, I think, cites the record of 686, 687 for the authority that the trial judge improperly sustained objections to examination of witnesses about grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.828" offset="24054680">If you turn over to the next page, on page 688, you find the witness was permitted to be asked and answered a question as to whether he testified before the 1954 grand jury or the 1958 -- 1956 grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.610" offset="24121762">Now on 3500, there has been some criticism of the trial court on the ground that by telling the Government that he was going to take whatever they turned over as being admitted to be a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.329" offset="24220714">That he discouraged the Government possibly from producing at least for examination, other documents that they might have produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.336" offset="24268675">Well, its urge for production in all instances wherein the language of the statute, they say, "You produce documents required -- statements comes in 3500."</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.875" offset="24318830">And the remark about you're having admitted to these statements, was when the United States attorney after having submitted a large number of documents in chambers one day later, was trying to back out of it and say, "I think we have given you some things that aren't really statements within the statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.450" offset="24425200">And apparently they have, but the trial judge said, "No, you've handed them over and I haven't looked at them, the next item, and I'm not going back over that again."</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.886" offset="24478908">Now, furthermore, the trial judge permitted extensive cross-examination of witnesses as to whether you had given -- whether they had given statements, whether notes were taken, whether transcripts were made to various government attorneys, to the NLRB, to the McCarran Committee and the Court denied the motions for additional production, not because he thought that, although he may have, that a Senate committee couldn't be forced to hand over any statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.177" offset="24680051">Or not because, he thought the attorney for the Government in say the Jencks case in Texas couldn't be forced to hand over a statement, but he denied the motion for the simple reason that he just felt they are not made out a factual case of any additional statements having been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.644" offset="24781928">And the United States attorney stated categorically on more than one occasion and he produced everything he had and everything he knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.471" offset="24881298">Mr. Taylor did not mention in his argument the Court portion of the argument in the brief on the use of uncorroborated admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.134" offset="24955904">I'd like to add to what we've said in the brief, this case I reread recently, the case of Bram against the United States in 168 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="6225.685" offset="25006164">A decision by I think was then Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.538" offset="25021524">In which he goes into the reasons for the rule, and he pointed out that Bram, at that time of the statement which he gave was -- which was used against him, was in a position where he was naturally anxious, he was naturally afraid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6255.410" offset="25124968">He was anxious to win favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.044" offset="25143568">He was then in a position where he might think to own up would be a material help to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6264.555" offset="25161644">As Justice Fuller put in one place, he was not a free agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.747" offset="25190379">Now in these cases, all these statements that witnesses testified to that Gardner made, Gardner was certainly -- I mean, Travis made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.298" offset="25240534">Travis was certainly a free agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6287.044" offset="25251506">He was an official in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.966" offset="25259238">He was travelling around.</text>
            <text syncTime="6290.946" offset="25267179">He was giving orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.535" offset="25277524">He had no reason to be afraid of these people to whom he was talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.996" offset="25303333">He wasn't trying to curry favor with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.871" offset="25322872">We think that just as was the -- to it in this rule, so-called perjury rule, that the trial court ruled correctly in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.080" offset="25387656">Now, I would like to take up very briefly the motions for a new trial, there were two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6332.033" offset="25431542">Neither was based -- both related to Gardner, neither was based on anything Gardner said in the Travis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.179" offset="25476054">Both relating to matters he had said in the West trial which is going on in Cleveland, normal simultaneously with the Travis trial in Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.064" offset="25535613">Defendant's reply brief makes a some -- the false testimony which it supposed to have given in Denver, consisted in the main of two statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6372.403" offset="25592978">One, he was asked on cross-examination, “You were never in the armed forces were you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6381.819" offset="25630699">And he said, “No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6383.019" offset="25635401">And the cross-examiner dropped it and went on to another subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.831" offset="25670719">It is true as it turned out later on after both trials that Gardner had been unknown to anybody in the U.S. Attorney's office or in the department that was working on either of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6411.957" offset="25751176">He had been in the army for a period between 1922 and 1926 and had deserted in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.824" offset="25786702">Now, in the West case, the trial judge held a three and a half day hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.491" offset="25809377">Gardner went back on the stand, various attorneys testified, FBI agents testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="6435.295" offset="25844590">And the trial judge wrote a somewhat lengthy opinion which is in 170 Federal Supplement, in which he found first Gardner had not committed perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6451.691" offset="25910105">In second place, that he thought that the question about his military service on the stand, related to World War II and that he had reason to think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6466.448" offset="25969142">And he concluded that Gardner had not been convicted on -- that the defendants in that case had not been convicted on false testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.973" offset="26027238">Now, the petitioner brings up the fact that in an FBI report in 1955 after Gardner had, I think, been expelled from the Communist Party, the occurrence is this, this is a sort of biographical statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6506.805" offset="26130578">It's not written by Gardner, it's into sort of tabular form.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.037" offset="26155551">It's on file in this Court in the cases brought by West and Haupt which are, I think, No. 93 and -- No. 73 and No. 74 miscellaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.859" offset="26210826">This term, as to -- it says, under military service, there's the word, "None."</text>
            <text syncTime="6538.047" offset="26255548">Now we don't know what questions the agent asked Gardner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6541.881" offset="26270908">We don't know what answers Gardner gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="6543.755" offset="26278431">This is a report.</text>

            <text syncTime="6556.032" offset="26327542">I gather, this was the initial report on Gardner and I suppose when they contact the witness for the first time, they got a good deal of biographical data.</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.747" offset="26378324">It's in -- begins at page 1270 of the second volume of the joint appendix in the Haupt case which is I think on file in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6579.649" offset="26422000">Furthermore, not only did the defendant have this -- that report, a copy of that report at the trial of this case, but a copy was also put in at the hearing on a motion for new trial in the West case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.837" offset="26506742">And when the judge found that Gardner had not testified falsely, he took into consideration that he must have taken into consideration the FBI report as well as the other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6618.504" offset="26577377">Now, the second matter is that Gardner told different stories about his marital history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6626.845" offset="26610709">What turns out at the different stories -- the differences were related to two things, one, the date of his divorce from his first wife; and second, the date of his marriage to the second wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.022" offset="26683434">Now, he wasn't asked to produce any copy of a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.844" offset="26718751">In fact, I think he testified in the West case, he wasn't sure he had one, although he was sure he'd been divorced.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.794" offset="26758562">And while there's a statement in the record -- this is in No. 3, the record in No. 3 by a United States attorney somewhere, there was a decree in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="6677.081" offset="26811747">I don't think -- it doesn't appear what kind of a decree it was or whether it was a final decree or an interrogatory decree or what.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.265" offset="26840482">Now, the other thing that Gardner is supposed to have misrepresented is the date of his second marriage.W</text>
            <text syncTime="6690.301" offset="26864619">ell, that was a common law marriage?</text>
            <text syncTime="6692.062" offset="26871620">I don't know of what the effective date of a common law marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6695.205" offset="26884159">Gardner didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.752" offset="26890428">He and his wife talked it over and finally came up with the notion, they'd been married in November 1945, but I don't suppose the man really knows to this day whether he was actually married on that date or not, unless his engaged expert opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.710" offset="27002232">It also seems to us that both these things are so inconsequential.</text>
            <text syncTime="6732.963" offset="27035251">So, not -- I'm not putting it on grounds so much that they're irrelevant to the issue of the case, but even -- that the jury even if it had known of them, even if they'd been brought out at the trial, it wouldn't have taken any different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="6747.995" offset="27095333">Are we going to disbelieve a man because he deserted from the army in 1926, disbelieve him on the stand in 1958?</text>
            <text syncTime="6758.813" offset="27138591">Are we going to disbelieve him because he hasn't been able to get straight dates of his marital history under the circumstances I have described?</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.297" offset="27176521">I don't think that it would affect the jury one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="6774.077" offset="27199718">And certainly, the trial judge who -- decided at the trial, was in a better to judge than I am here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6792.906" offset="27274951">It just doesn't seem to us that that kind of evidence could make the showing that is necessary to grant a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6805.094" offset="27323747">I might also point out that during the trial, counsel had in his possession a transcript, a daily transcript of Gardner's testimony in the West case in which some of these inconsistencies as to his marital history appear, but he didn't knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6831.129" offset="27427924">It was not -- it also appears that counsel had, at that time, a copy of the FBI report I've mentioned, because it's referred to in the record in No. 3 as defendant's Exhibit J for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.851" offset="27522800">So I take it that it was not introduced in evidence, but it was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="6862.614" offset="27553834">That is all Your Honor, unless the Court has some further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="6886.934" offset="27651114">Mr. Chief Justice, I did not mean to say and I don't think I said that all but two of these cases have been brought in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.956" offset="27683192">What I think, I said and meant to say was that all but two of these cases have been brought where the affidavit was filed, not where it was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="6906.348" offset="27728750">Now, that of course means in the case of the national officers would be Washington, but in the case of the local officers, it would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.399" offset="27760933">If a national officer lives in Washington, obviously mailing and filing are in the same district.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.928" offset="27783084">Similarly, if he lives in the same place where the regional office is, a local officer will have no venue problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6926.127" offset="27807848">Both will be in the same district, but the two examples I gave were one from each.</text>
            <text syncTime="6930.943" offset="27827179">The Ben Gold case was a case to a national officer and was brought here in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="6935.638" offset="27845883">The Jencks case, I averted to, which was a local officer case, but the West is wide and the distances between the place of mailing and the place of filing was all the way from New Mexico to El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="6949.514" offset="27901471">The prosecution was in El Paso, where the regional office was located and where the affidavit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.098" offset="27927803">The affidavit was in fact mailed from New Mexico, silver mine or somewhere like that, where he had his union headquarters just as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6965.500" offset="27965419">Now, my statement was right I think that putting all of these together, that the only other case where the prosecution has been brought at the place of mailing is the Valenti case where the Third Circuit came with the other conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.927" offset="28023097">There is one other case that is -- that is rather more complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6984.305" offset="28040547">There had been three national officer cases, this one, the Ben Gold case and the Bryson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6990.739" offset="28066356">The Bryson case was marine cooks and stewards and was a union officer -- national union officer who lived on the west coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6999.511" offset="28101465">He was first indicted on the west coast where the affidavit was mailed, but as soon as he challenged venue in the west coast, the Government withdrew the indictment representing to the court that there was doubt about there being venue in California and therefore, they would withdraw the indictment in California and bring the case here in the district, and they did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7022.977" offset="28195297">And Bryson was then indicted here in the district where his affidavit was filed, he being a national officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7029.374" offset="28220897">Bryson then said, "It's a hardship for me to be tried in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="7033.762" offset="28238451">Please send the case back to California." And Judge Morris sitting here in the District Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="7038.887" offset="28258931">So he was tried in California on a Washington indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7043.086" offset="28275754">When he got back to California again, the District Court there said, well, we don't think we have venue and we don't think the case should be sent back out here, but he has waived his objection to this by asking for it to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="7055.718" offset="28326222">So that was the long history on the -- on the Bryson thing.</text>
