            <text syncTime="11.790" offset="150549">Mr. Chief Justice, may I have please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.079" offset="167685">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals or the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.591" offset="201749">That court affirmed an order of the United States District Court to the Northern District of Illinois, quashing a writ of habeas corpus and remanding the petitioner here to the custody of Warden of the Illinois State Penitentiary at Joliet, Illinois, where petitioner was then and is now confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.058" offset="307597">Petitioner is confined in the State Penitentiary, pursuant to a judgment of conviction of the crime of murder, which was imposed upon him after a trial before a judge and jury in the Criminal Court of Cook County in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.944" offset="391189">At his trial, petitioner contested the admissibility of two confessions which were introduced into evidence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.555" offset="433612">Timely motion was made to suppress these confessions invoking with Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.658" offset="453987">It was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.684" offset="458062">The confessions were received in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.181" offset="468093">Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to 199 years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.181" offset="492126">Petitioner was unable to appeal his conviction because he had no money to purchase a transcript of the testimony at his murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.640" offset="533922">Thereafter, when the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act was adopted following this Court's decision in Marino against Ragen, petitioner filed a petition for a post-conviction hearing under that Act, received a hearing, additional testimony was taken, some transcripts where then written up at state expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.445" offset="625142">After hearing the post-conviction judge denied relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.744" offset="642382">I might add that in the post-conviction hearing the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was explicitly invoked as a ground for the petitioner's prayer that his conviction be set aside, because coerced confession were used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.634" offset="705912">On writ of error proceedings in the Supreme Court of Illinois, full hearing was -- had briefs and arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.215" offset="736214">All of the federal constitutional claims, which are now here, were raised there.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.443" offset="761187">Relief was denied on the merits of the federal constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.653" offset="790026">There was then a petition for certiorari timely filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.286" offset="808521">The petition was denied and the order of denial read that the petition for certiorari is denied without prejudice to the right of petitioner to apply for a writ of habeas corpus in an appropriate U.S. District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.547" offset="893576">The petition for habeas corpus in the Northern District of Illinois followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.757" offset="918444">The district judge received into evidence all of the transcripts of the state court proceedings in the post-conviction hearing case and in the original murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.250" offset="976332">Both sides rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.825" offset="986676">The district judge ultimately decided that by the present day standards announced by this Court in such cases as Watts against Indiana, Haley against Ohio, Chambers against Florida, petitioner's confessions were obtained in a manner which violated due process, but since none of those cases were on the books in 1936, the rules of those cases were not applicable to petitioner's case and petitioner was remanded to the custody of the Warden.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.125" offset="1127842">On appeal, the Court of Appeals ignored the District Court's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.482" offset="1145292">It held that by any standards, the confessions were voluntary and affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.209" offset="1172250">This Court granted the petition for certiorari on June 27th of 1960, gave us leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.291" offset="1212583">We have no printed record, but our proceeding upon the original papers pursuant to the instructions of the clerk of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.728" offset="3322232">Taken downstairs, put in a police van, taken to a second police station, held isolated in the cell there for approximately two hours, returned then by police van at approximately 1:15 p.m. to the North Avenue Police Station, where his interrogation commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.158" offset="3399973">The first afternoon he was interrogated by two officers for a period of approximately five and one half hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.905" offset="3799019">Officer Riley then volunteered from the stand that there was no purpose in this questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.259" offset="3832456">After this purposeless questioning from the list of every crime in the district had gone on for some six or seven hours according to the police testimony, Reck was taken to still another police station, the Shakespeare Police Station, held there briefly, then taken downtown to the central police headquarters where the Detective Bureau is and placed in a lineup.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.411" offset="4525014">Reck was being exhibited up on the second floor to these civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.136" offset="4543927">At some point after 7 p.m. Reck fainted and was carried to a bench and then people put him on a stretcher, took him downstairs to the street, loaded him into a police van and away they went to the County Hospital where a -- an intern gave him an examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.219" offset="4632221">They could not find no marks or bruises on his body, concluded that he was not fit for the hospital, to use the intern's words, and rejected him to use another word of the intern whereupon, Reck was loaded back into the wagon, back to North Avenue, placed back in the show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.869" offset="4706826">He became ill, police officer, Officer Riley, stated on the trial that he became concerned about Reck and that he wanted Reck to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.667" offset="4750085">And so he said, “I took him into an unfurnished handball court in the rear of the police station, second floor and I put him in there and I closed the door and I kept all of these civilians away from him because I wanted him to rest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.484" offset="4809331">Unfortunately, a Sergeant Aitken in charge of the Peacock murder investigation and two other police officers got around Sergeant Riley somehow and entered the handball court within a matter of one or two or three or four minutes after Reck was placed in there to rest and Sergeant Aitken and the officers began questioning Reck specifically about the Peacock murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.849" offset="4922807">Now, this was at somewhere between 8 o'clock and 9 p.m. on the third night of his interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.316" offset="5400639">Reck was permitted to sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.102" offset="5407744">When he sat down according to Dr. Abraham, he got his color back in his face, but then other individuals came in to interrogate Reck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.764" offset="5438464">He was told to stand up and in Dr. Abraham's phrase, “The color went away from him again.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.096" offset="5467721">Dr. Abraham was then for some reason or other, had to leave the handball court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.908" offset="5494993">The door closed and the interrogation resumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.722" offset="5522265">Some time thereafter, Dr. Abraham was again called to the handball court just prior to the time that Dr. Abraham had been called to the handball court, according to uncontradicted police testimony, Reck began to look ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.151" offset="5591960">He bent over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.505" offset="5597393">He vomited from his mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.140" offset="5603976">He vomited a quantity of blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.468" offset="5613275">It seemed to come out of his mouth all in a rush.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.453" offset="5625187">He bled for two or three minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.196" offset="5636159">When Dr. Abraham entered the handball court, he saw Reck lying on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.611" offset="5665834">He saw a pool of blood on the floor beside Reck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.182" offset="5684120">The pool of blood was approximately one foot in diameter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.015" offset="5699480">Its color was a bright red, to use Dr. Abraham's phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.336" offset="5720691">Reck was placed in a stretcher, carried out of the station, back to the County Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.028" offset="5743470">Morphine and two other drugs were administered to him there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.757" offset="5758412">He was kept in a guarded hospital room all that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.126" offset="5771891">I might add that in the preceding three days, his father had come to the police station twice and that night he came to the hospital and police guards turned him away from his son and would not permit him to see his son.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.332" offset="5832704">The next morning at 9:30, Reck informed the doctors and it's uncontroverted that he did in fact inform the doctors that the police had been beating him in the stomach for a period of two and half days or so prior to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.965" offset="5903235">This was some eight or nine hours before he confessed to the Peacock murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.716" offset="5934268">He had seen no lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.599" offset="5941791">He had had no contact with his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.879" offset="5954853">There is nothing in the record to indicate that he'd heard of this Court's decision in Brown against Mississippi and knew the legal significance of such a beating so far as getting suppressed or confession that he haven't made yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.748" offset="6006366">Nevertheless, it is uncontradicted that he told the officers he was being beaten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.391" offset="6028936">It is of course contradicted, his testimony that he was in fact beaten as contradicted by the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.123" offset="6055894">9:30, Saturday morning, the fourth day of his interrogation commenced when he was placed the car of Captain Harry O'Connell of the Chicago police department, Commander of the North Avenue Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.615" offset="6109811">Captain O'Connell testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.253" offset="6116394">He was taken out of the hospital in a wheelchair, placed in O'Connell's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.100" offset="6135724">O'Connell got in the car, started back to the police station and while they were in the car, the interrogation resumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.020" offset="6171460">Back to the handball court for some four or five or six hours according to Captain O'Connell down to the State's Attorney's Office at about 2 to 3 o'clock p.m., several more hours of interrogation, Reck ultimately confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.323" offset="6240632">He confessed in a joint confession in which some 65 times he said, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.117" offset="6263829">or “Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.120" offset="6267904">And on a few occasion volunteered a little information, Reck's answers are set out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.546" offset="6305520">The following day, he made another confession if -- was a reiteration of the joint confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.723" offset="6334255">He was not brought to court and arraigned until the following Thursday, which was the ninth day of detention, thus in brief, are the facts which led to the confessions which we claimed are coerced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.368" offset="6684818">Dr. Abraham although he testified twice at the trial never testified that Reck suffered merely a nerve reaction and Sergeant Aitken never did explain how the nerve reaction caused the vomiting of the blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.996" offset="6751378">I might only add that Sergeant Aitken, who vividly described the vomiting of blood at the post-conviction hearing in 1952, absolutely denied that he ever saw Reck vomit blood at the murder trial in 1936 and therefore, I think it's reasonable to suggest that Sergeant Aitken's credibility is somewhat questionable in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.650" offset="6969971">Nash and Goeth, after they have pleaded guilty and been sentenced and sent down to the penitentiary, were brought back to testify at the murder trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="1792.593" offset="7273723">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.695" offset="7286157">I shall argue this case on behalf of the Warden and Illinois in full recognition that this Court will make its own appraisal, at least from the uncontradicted facts in the record as to whether the two confessions admitted into petitioner's trial were voluntary or were the product of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.106" offset="7399842">On the other hand, I'm spared the necessity for discussing any question whether this Court should weigh conflicting testimony in the trial court by the very candid opening three lines of the reply brief in which, if I may read them, petitioner says, “Respondents,” that's we, “Urges that this Court should not weigh disputed testimony in deciding whether petitioner's confessions were the product of psychological coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.594" offset="7545710">Petitioner agrees -- show that there is not even an attempt to impose upon this Court the burden of as saying contradictory testimony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.518" offset="7605478">Now, if the Court please, with those observations, I should like if I may again have the indulgence of the Chief Justice to read not of course as authoritative on this Court because the language that I would read would beg and not answer the question that's before the Court, if I were to read it as conclusive, but I should like to read from the opinion of the Court of Appeals, the language of that Court, Judge Duffy dissenting of course, “That besides the ultimate question that petitioner presses upon this Court on this certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.546" offset="7873599">I -- the transcript is not printed in this case, but I am reading from page 21 of the State's blue bound printed brief and the citation is 254 F.2d 253.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.885" offset="7954892">The court says, “Invoking the aid of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of United States, Reck now contends that his confessions were the product of coercion, citing his lengthy detention incommunicado and the illness which developed during that period of time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.960" offset="8039215">This is the language that distills the essence of the court's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.493" offset="8065337">We are convinced, however, that the evidence proves that none of the treatment which he, that's a petitioner, received while he was being detained prior to Saturday afternoon produced produthe confessions by Reck while he became ill when Captain Aitken on Friday night probing they accused him of the Peacock killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.574" offset="8161677">His rugged determination to seem nothing to reveal the -- involvement in that affair had prevented the authorities from obtaining any incriminatory admission from him in regard to the crime until Saturday afternoon in the office of the State's Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.004" offset="8235342">Until then Reck, the strong man of the group had stood fast and on this occasion was only the realization that Goeth and Nash had confessed the Peacock killing and had implicated him and had in the presence of Crowley, the Assistant Prosecutor at that time, called upon Reck to tell holding Crowley, the truth about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.725" offset="8338265">“You know you were there and you know we are not lying about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.603" offset="8357804">That is not quoting Crowley, that's the other boys that Reck realized that quoting from this Court's opinion in Stein against New York, “The dance was over and the time had come to pay the business and the ball's rotations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.143" offset="8423946">That Your Honors did not regard those sentences as conclusive as quite evident from the fact that certiorari has been granted and my argument will be addressed to supporting that conclusion by two of the three judges of United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.409" offset="8528959">Before addressing the evidence, I think it is of more than passing importance to remind Your Honors that reviewing cases from 50 states and the federal jurisdictions, it escapes Your Honors' memory that the Supreme Court of Illinois, unlike many reviewing courts, will reverse a case even though there is no error in the record of any kind, even though there is sufficient evidence standing alone to sustain the conviction, if that court, weighing for itself though to be sure upon a printed or typewritten record, finds that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction beyond all reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.529" offset="8761448">That is not the criterion of appellate reviewing criminal cases in many jurisdictions, but the Supreme Court of Illinois regularly and repeatedly reverses convictions for no other reason and that of it isn't convinced that there's sufficient evidence to support the conviction as a pure question of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.203" offset="11296162">Now the United States Court of Appeals however, very conscientiously canvassed this case and in one way, I think the Petitioner suffers in this case because he has in Mr. Moore, such a good lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.990" offset="11403368">Every fact that could passively be brought out in petitioner's favor has been brought out by Mr. Moore in his really superlatively good briefs in the District Court and the Court of Appeals and in this Court, without any distortion or unfairness to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.364" offset="11496782">It's a remarkably good job and the Court of Appeals had the benefit of the always emphatically expressed views of that court's senior judge, Judge Duffy, in his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.921" offset="11571075">So these questions have been canvassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.400" offset="11584972">Now, the fact is as appears from the language that I read to you, that this defendant made two confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.515" offset="11633455">He was -- although the psychiatrist says he cried easily, he very resolutely withstood this questioning until he was confronted by the admissions of three other boys that they were guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.884" offset="11726869">Then he immediately, not after long and really torture confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.144" offset="11755917">This illness according the State's evidence, came on him not after torture, but as soon as the -- Dr. Peacock's murder was mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.173" offset="11804087">Dr. Peacock, a physician, had been summoned by telephone calls saying that a child was ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.410" offset="11833031">Dr. Peacock was a pediatrician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.032" offset="11843480">The address was a dark one and he was beaten to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.011" offset="11859466">These boys were arrested for bicycle thefts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.060" offset="11875662">Suspicion turned upon them and it wasn't until three of them confessed and implicated this defendant that he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.210" offset="11912234">In that case, other facts are reminiscent although not identical with the Stein case.</text>
