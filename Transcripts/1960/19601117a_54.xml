            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 54, Carl Braden, Petitioner, versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.528" offset="125471">Mr. Boudin.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="12.225" stopTime="1178.438">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="12.225" offset="152221">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.975" offset="163297">The petitioner, Carl Braden was convicted of contempt of Congress under 2 U.S.C. 192 as a result of his refusal to answer certain questions put to him in Atlanta, Georgia on July 30th, 1958 by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.677" offset="242082">The questions are set forth on page 3 of the petitioner's brief and in pages 3 to 5 of the record on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.640" offset="277922">Since there is some ambiguity in the questions at least as they appear, I shall, of course, have to explain something of the context which they were put.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.254" offset="320345">The petitioner is and was one of two field secretaries, the other being his wife, of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, an organization interested in furthering the cause of racial integration through education.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.088" offset="387741">The President is Mr. Aubrey Williams, who is the Director of the National Youth Administration under the late President Roosevelt.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.028" offset="423476">The petitioner has been active even before that employment in the field of racial integration, having and -- was indicted in Kentucky under a state law for sedition, as a result of having aided a Negro to purchase a house in a white community.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.798" offset="514591">The sedition indictment and conviction were eventually overruled as a result of this Court's decision in Pennsylvania against Nelson, which played a part in petitioner's hearing before the House Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.320" offset="572688">On May 21, 1958, the House Committee passed a resolution which appeared on page 137 of the record, directing that hearings to be held in Atlanta, Georgia on three subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.578" offset="637680">The first is what it called, Communist organization and infiltration in the textile and other basic industries located in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.321" offset="680626">The Second is Communist propaganda activities in the South and the third, the entry and dissemination within the United States, of foreign Communist Party propaganda.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.988" offset="731303">And they say at the beginning, that while the Government's brief in opposing certiorari states on page 2, we think is the fact that the actual subject matter of these hearings was, "Communist infiltration of Southern industry."</text>
            <text syncTime="174.553" offset="801625">I emphasize that word because there is no suggestion that Mr. Braden ever had any connection with the textile or other industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.058" offset="839555">Actually, the Government takes the position, that all three of the subjects of the current investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.269" offset="868498">Now, Your Honors will recall, I said May 22 was the date of this Committee resolution, May 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.265" offset="896397">Between May 21, 1958 and July 23, 1958, when Mr. Braden was served with a subpoena, directing him to appear on the second day of the hearing on July 30th, he continued to be engaged in his activities on behalf of the Southern Conference Educational Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.320" offset="968704">And he did two other things which were the subject to the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.456" offset="985213">First, he played a part, the Committee believed he paid -- played a major part, in a letter sent on or delivered but certainly bearing the date of July 22, 1958 to the members of Congress and signed by 200 Negro leaders in the South, asking the Congress not to commit the House Committee to carryout its contended visit to Atlanta, Georgia, on the theory that the Committee would -- that there would be a confusion between Un-American Activities and what went out, it were regarded by many people in the South with Un-American Activities, namely, furthering racial integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.389" offset="1160965">That was July 22, which happens to be the date of the subpoena that was issued to Mr. Braden and served on him on July 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.332" offset="1196701">In addition, there appears in the record here, a letter, I should say, by the way, that the minister -- the Negro leader's letter is at page 98 of the record, but there appears in addition, what I will refer to as -- well, the sedition letter, though it's very far from being seditious.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.965" offset="1287189">It appears on 107 and 108 of the record and also at page 116 of the record and that is a letter which Mr. Braden and his wife, on the letterhead of this -- of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, wrote to the public, to their fellow citizens asking them to oppose three bills then pending in Congress, which would have had the effect of overturning the decision of this Court in Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.189" offset="1420100">That by the way is the very letter which is the subject of Count 5, of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.144" offset="1459911">Mr. Braden appeared at the congressional committee hearing on the second day in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.248" offset="1488332">He had been served incidentally, while vacationing at the seashore home of Mr. Harvey O'Connor, the Chairman of the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, a committee directed principally towards the vindication of civil liberties, a contrary distinction of Southern Conference was interested in the civil rights, that distinction can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.338" offset="1572760">Mr. O'Connor is a well-known biographer of industrial leaders principally and headed by then, Mr. Braden and its entire family to spend their time in Little Compton, Rhode Island, not Newport but near Newport.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.428" offset="1653112">I mention that because Your Honors will see that two other counts referred to the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.130" offset="1679862">When Mr. Braden appeared on the second day, he was interrogated by Mr. Arens, the counsel to the House of Un-American Activities Committee, on this subject of the letter which had been sent by the Negro leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.172" offset="1756035">The interrogation appears at 97 of the record and includes an attack upon a Negro leaders by Congressman Jackson, who first charged to that point that they were, were practically Communists and later on, at the end of the record, after some further thought, said, perhaps they were only dukes and gave them a chance to exculpate themselves by writing to the Committee and saying that they really didn't know what they were doing, Your Honors can see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.976" offset="1859271">Then Mr. Arens proceeded to examine Mr. Braden with respect to the matters which are set forth in the indictment because the item with respect to the Negro leaders is not up here in the indictment, although Mr. Braden refused to answer that, as well as the other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.615" offset="1925831">Before I come to the question, let me say, that the refusal to answer these six questions set forth in the indictment was based explicitly upon the First Amendment and explicitly, upon this Court's decision in Watkins and in Sweezy and other cases, that the issue of pertinency was raised by Mr. Braden explicitly, a lack of legislative purpose, the vagueness of the Committee's mandate, all of the textures that could be raised, were raised at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.625" offset="2045889">Your Honors will recall that this occurred after the Watkins decision in 1957 and before the Barenblatt decision was therefore, no occasion from Mr. -- from Mr. Braden to mention Barenblatt would it take that into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.721" offset="2110255">Now, Mr. Arens in the course of the extended colloquy which appears between 89 and 110 of the record, charged Mr. Braden with respect to this letter which is referred to in Count 5, a stimulating political pressure against security as if a letter to ones fellow citizens, which is reproduced in the record, should be subject to criticism and also said that he thought that they wanted information concerning the Southern Conference Educational Fund because they might want to cite, C.I.T.E that organization as a Communist front or a subversive organization as they referred to the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.529" offset="2289455">Now, I come down to the counts in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.828" offset="2310666">The first counts, 1 and 2, appearing on page 3, "Did you participate in a meeting here at that time and who solicited the quarters to be made available to the Southern Conference Educational Fund, related to a meeting, only secret ones, so far as the record shows, of the executive board of the Southern Conference Educational Fund headed by its officers at the American Red Cross building in Atlanta, Georgia?"</text>
            <text syncTime="581.491" offset="2429367">And while the record seems to indicate that Mr. Braden did participate from further cross-examination of him, he declined to answer these two questions for the reasons stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.965" offset="2471267">The next two questions "Are you connected with the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee and did you and Harvey O'Connor in the course of your conference there in Rhode Island, developed plans and strategies, somewhat frightening phrase, outlining work schedules for the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee?"</text>
            <text syncTime="613.209" offset="2556217">I suspect and there's nothing in the record to indicate any connection between Mr. Braden and the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, except as being the guest of a more well-to-do host, who happened to have a seashore home, I suspect that if the marshal had not found Mr. Braden at the home of Mr. O'Connor, these questions were never have been asked, but there is no connection between Mr. Braden and Mr. O'Connor or the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.401" offset="2664991">I came to the last question first because I want to come to -- except, being the most interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.671" offset="2686098">I would just like to ask you whether or not, you being a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, had anything to do there with the Southern Newsletter?</text>
            <text syncTime="654.666" offset="2722043">Now, oddly enough, there is nothing in this record, even the hearing which Mr. Braden appeared or in a trial to indicate what the -- the Southern Newsletter is.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.187" offset="2764152">Other witnesses testified generally on the subject and it appears to be a periodical devoted furthering the cause integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.477" offset="2797275">Although Mr. Braden is not the editor of that but of another paper, which he refers to in the record and all that Mr. Arens could say on the trial is that he thinks that the Southern Newsletter sort of -- some sort of a pamphlet that you fold up.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.207" offset="2860178">This is all the content with respect to this putatively seditious document.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.512" offset="2885465">I should add also that at the course of the hearings at which Mr. Braden appeared on July 30th, and on the course of the trial, there was not a single word of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.660" offset="2926007">I mean testimony, I'm not talking about hearsay or opinions as Mr. Arens gave a great deal of that and it was characterized by the court which accepted it as merely hearsay and is not proof of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.506" offset="2973445">There is no -- no evidence in this record at all that the Southern Conference or the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee or the Southern Newsletter are Communist organizations or periodical in the last case or that Mr. O'Connor or that Mr. Braden is or was, a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.915" offset="3055052">I'm not suggesting now that I would have a different view as to the rights of Mr. Braden, bad in such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.835" offset="3082742">I don't have to meet that issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.789" offset="3102490">Then came a trial, first it was a citation, there was in indictment and a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.634" offset="3125896">Then at the trial, Mr. Arens testified again.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.052" offset="3139584">I mentioned before that he stated it was the Committee's understanding that these people were Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.202" offset="3160168">It was the Committee's information that they were, in those special cases and he repeated his interest in citing Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.032" offset="3203532">He described the petition of the Negro ministers as an attempt to preclude, I'm referring now to page 29 of the record, preclude committee and soften committee hearings as no one appealed to the statement of the House and the members House, was again subject to criticism and referred to generally, on page 29 of the record, and this is Count 5 of course, at least one of the letters -- one of the letters, with a letter signed by Mr. Braden and another person, his wife, I say, urging congressional action of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.734" offset="3346265">And of course, this was a subject of count 5, which says, "Were you a member of the Communist Party," the instant, Your Honors aren't here to hear the dramatic inflection of the question, the instant that you affixed your signature to that letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.267" offset="3412407">This was not a -- a general inquiry of the Communist Party, the inquiry had been contained in the letter and the effort was made to criticize the writing of a letter or to undercut its appeal at -- on the theory that perhaps, Mr. Braden at that instant, which is also that the (Inaudible) are concerned about that are members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.957" offset="3487222">Now, we come down to our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.612" offset="3505821">First, while taking the position as we have in the briefs that we do not -- or as differentially concur in this Court's decision of the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.002" offset="3559424">We do not feel that that issue has to be met in this case, because neither the rationale of Barenblatt nor the facts in that case, are the same as the rationale which we think, controls this case and the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.313" offset="3620655">Let me state in a few lines that why we feel that to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.505" offset="3641344">In Barenblatt, this Court held that an inquiry into Barenblatt's membership better known into the Communist Party -- in a Communist Party, could be made notwithstanding what was recognized in the majority opinion, of course, in the other opinion, as an intrusion into the First Amendment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.003" offset="3727339">The theory -- theory on which the right to ask was held to outweigh the right to refuse, was the theory of what it called self-defense of the Government, citing or paraphrasing Dennis, namely the right of the Government to investigate violent overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.511" offset="3825455">Now, the Court held that that Communist Party was by its tenants, so aligned to the doctrine of the overthrow the Government that it was proper to substitute the words Communist Party for the words, those who want to overthrow the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.561" offset="3897657">And therefore, that this intrusion was permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.292" offset="3920541">Now, of course, this Court recognized in Barenblatt not only by its devotion, its analysis of the Communist Party, but by the questions which it did not decide, which Your Honors will recall, namely, other peoples membership in the Communist Party and finally Barenblatt's connection with the art sciences and professions group, recognized that it was dealing with a group which it regarded and as sui generic a special dangerous group and in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion in -- in Sweezy, this point is made that there is a special status to the Communist Party -- of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.155" offset="4095979">The Court in making its decision in Barenblatt, relied upon a combination of I think what we can call, judicial notice based upon prior trials of Dennis etcetera and based upon the variety of legislation in which Congress perhaps, violating the principles against the (Inaudible) perhaps not has made findings with respect to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.576" offset="4201723">Now, in the present case as I've indicated, we are not dealing with the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.656" offset="4225964">He only mentioned that the Communist Party is in count 5, which I think for the reason which I will indicate, as a weakest count for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.046" offset="4255535">I'm rather pleased that the Government thinks, is the strongest count here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.884" offset="4274866">All of these others deal with organizations, which so far as this record is concerned, have been devoting themselves to good causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.557" offset="4321573">And they say the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, a sponsor to at least three cases in this Court, I think that its principal function (Inaudible) against Casey (Inaudible) and Abramowitz against Brucker and no one could suggest dysfunctioning of those cases, bought it within the ambit of Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.069" offset="4391685">Now, I say again that there was not a word in the record of a single witness, there was a testimony by the way in Barenblatt on this subject, a single witness that these people were members of the Communist Party, or that the organizations were subversive organizations of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.332" offset="4464724">And we say that we do not here, have what was called in Sweezy, compelling reasons, what was called in Kelly the same, what was called in Bates cogent reasons, what was called in N.A.A.C.P. against Alabama controlling the substantial reasons for overriding what are recognized to be First Amendment rights that we were dealing in some of these cases with -- with the recognition that Communist Party within the area of the First Amendment right to be overrule, surely, that will apply here in the organizations that I am discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.802" offset="4622608">Now, I turn specifically to count 5 because there we regard, it has the most dangerous argument that can be made by a Government because count 5 involves an appeal for one's fellow citizen to protest against pending legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.156" offset="4700035">Well, this is a very far cry, it hardly needs to be argued, very far cry from the violent overthrow the Government that in one of the earliest cases as Second Circuit indicated referring to the judgment can take of course was within the permissible ambit of this vague or what we thought was vague language in House Resolution 5 and its predecessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.941" offset="4795120">It's certainly a far cry from the violent overthrow the Government discussed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.257" offset="4816436">I --</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="1208.192" offset="4936182">I thought it was important enough, critical enough to the conviction here of the defendant or the offender to the conviction to reproduce the letter itself on page 116 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.805" offset="4978604">And, when one bears in mind that not only the rationale of Barenblatt and of this overwriting of First Amendment, but more affirmatively, the meaning of the right of petition, a right which I think really is antecedent to the right of freedom of speech in the Anglo-Saxon world, a right which appears in Magna Carta in the petition of right, one is rather surprised at the emphasis placed by the court below and by the Government on this exercise of the right to petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.710" offset="5114232">I would have said that the Government should welcome even the use by communist of the right to petition as against the imputed desire to overthrow the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.396" offset="5172955">Now, when I read the Government's brief and I should like to give Your Honors one or two quotations from its reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.003" offset="5199391">I'm again rather surprised as the emphasis made on count 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.272" offset="5220498">At page 33 of the Government's brief in this case, it refers to spreading Party propaganda to petitions to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.035" offset="5255502">Well, it is suggested that the Congress will be enticed into membership of the Communist Party and of course, when we examine the petition itself, two petitions are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.346" offset="5308792">The Negro ministers, Negro leaders and Mr. and Mrs. Braden, how can that possibly be considered communist propaganda?</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.712" offset="5346200">Page 44, the Government says, the Communists were circulating petitions in the South concerning legislative activity, it refers to the Pennsylvania against Nelson bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.155" offset="5391966">Surely, that is permissible and that need a kind of activity that we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.029" offset="5411506">Then a reference is made later on, an effort to petition Congress with the Communist infiltration and propaganda activity on page 53 and on 54, the Party efforts to pressure or influence Congress act as the security measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.791" offset="5482559">When one places these remarks in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.757" offset="5498441">Again, as what Mr. Justice Brandeis has said in Gilbert against Minnesota in dissenting -- in his concurring opinion in Whitney against California, it is impossible to reconcile the reliance by Mr. Justice Brandeis upon an active political force in the community actively engaged in playing the part of the democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.384" offset="5612857">And what is really the most undemocratic, the most un-American I would respectfully suggest -- suggestion that petition should not be permitted or that they should be -- I think they should be dissuaded sanctions to be imposed upon the petitioner by the investigation of their political affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.505" offset="5705435">There is of course a massive history and if time permitted and if I have well learning, I should probably indicate it to the Court that there are few things that I came across recently that's quite interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.240" offset="5752351">One was an early sedition case, an early case against William (Inaudible) if Your Honors will recall 1798 would be added to the Philadelphia aurora and he was charged -- I may say he was acquitted in 30 minutes, he was charge with being evilly disposed because he willfully and maliciously stirred up a seditious riot (Inaudible) by attempting to obtain signatures to a petition against the alien law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.761" offset="5882441">And Your Honors will recall at John Quincy Adams as a Congressman in 1837 where he had a very vigorous fight in the Congress over the question none of which he could ask people whether they were members of any organization but whether the Congress should not table or consider petitions which were filed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.480" offset="5973243">He wanted them to consider it and he said, and describe that interesting, he said it very doubtfully, the next step will be to inquire -- it's the political belief of petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.812" offset="6022666">For a quite number of years from 1837 to date before the Congress decided to do that or a Committee decided to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.622" offset="6057880">Now, I turn to my second point but I want to leave enough time for Mr. Coe, my distinguished colleague here to argue, I think in the second point which is was there a legislative purpose in this investigation in Atlanta and specifically with respect to our client, Mr. Braden, there is considerable doubt on our mind as to whether the investigation in Atlanta at all had a legislative purpose for anybody because the principal witnesses who testified there, one on this colonization of the textile industry, Mr. Penia, had given exactly the same testimony in Boston in March and he named exactly the same people who had worked under his direction in the textile industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.152" offset="6227989">Therefore, I can't quite say the purpose of the hearing in Atlanta, Georgia except, a repetition of headlines in the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.250" offset="6256410">And Mr. Fishman, the collector of -- Deputy Collector of Customs -- Director of Customs, testified as to the importation of foreign propaganda, exactly what he has testified to between 7 and 12 times in the United States for that and several times after.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.831" offset="6330702">I do not have to sustain the burden, I'm sure of persuading the Court that the entire hearing in Atlanta had no legislative objective but that of exposure, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.821" offset="6370617">If I can limit myself to Mr. Braden, in Mr. Braden's case, we say that there are four basic non-legislative purposes of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.128" offset="6415862">The first is that this is an attempt despite full critics of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.692" offset="6446164">Not only the interrogation here, but Your Honor will see the 1958 Annual Report of the Committee which we have quoted, "In referring to the Atlanta cases of Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Braden, describes them in connection with the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee and that Committee's criticism of the House of Un-American Activities Committee."</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.219" offset="6528293">But I failed to indicate Your Honors that there is one thing the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee has done besides sponsoring cases in this Court, it has led an obviously ineffectual campaign against the House Committee on Un-American Activities, by asking Congressmen to oppose it not to -- to a continuous its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.058" offset="6611571">I don't think that the failure is necessarily a ground for a private conviction of Mr. Braden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.572" offset="6637693">But, not only was Mr. Braden subpoenaed here, but Mr. Wilkinson in the next case, who appeared in Atlanta, Georgia and who is the subject to the most interesting admission by Committee counsel I think, namely if you had not appeared here in Atlanta, Georgia, said Mr. Arens and Mr. Wilkinson, we would to oppose the Committee, we would never have subpoenaed you and the Committee couples Braden and Wilkinson together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.159" offset="6752005">And I may say that Mr. O'Connor did not escape either, because if he was about to address a public meeting (Inaudible) critical of the Committee, which is holding hearing there, he was subpoenaed and has been indicted for failure to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.557" offset="6805608">We have here three critics of the Committee, thus far subpoenaed and we have the Committee's attacks upon the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, quite vigorous and perhaps understandable if not justifiable, since we have thought that the people were sovereign rather than the Committees, but there's a difference between the Committee putting out of publication, which one can't enjoin this distribution of publication of and subpoenaing a witness and compelling him to testify because he is a critic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.103" offset="6923786">Now, the second objection, oh, I -- I should tell Your Honors one thing and that goes back to the Wilkinson brief if Your Honors do not have that brief before you, I assume at the moment, because it's the Government's theory on why it has the right to subpoena critics of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.176" offset="6996093">A -- I won't even call it a radical, I would call it a violent extension of Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.121" offset="7027858">In the Wilkinson brief, the Government says at page 53 and 54, the reason why it has to -- it has a right to examine Braden and other critics is because this Committee constantly has before it, the issues whether it should be abolished, continue present course or change or expand its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.085" offset="7127751">And therefore, it has a right to call a man, make him testify because it wants information from him as to whether it should expand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.731" offset="7162337">Applying for the present case, the Committee would then say, we call Mr. Braden and Mr. Wilkinson before us, because we wanted to know whether we should abolish ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.945" offset="7203192">And the reason we asked them whether or not, they were members of the Communist Party, was because we wanted to know whether it discount their recommendations to us that we be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.243" offset="7248332">I think the Government's statement at page 53 and 54 in Wilkinson, I wish it had been in a Braden brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.880" offset="7270902">I cast Your Honors, will apply the admission from one to the other, is the most valuable admission and of course, I wish it was really true but -- but we all know the Committee did not call Mr. Braden and Mr. Wilkinson because it wanted to evaluate their evaluation of the Committee's progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.453" offset="7345194">Now, the third -- the third objection we find here, you can say, the second, is the theory of citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.234" offset="7388348">The desire to get information from Braden and from these other people, as to whether organization, should be cited as Communist organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.102" offset="7431816">And we have a considerable doubt and this Court will resolve that doubt possibly at the SACB case, which I have no connection with, as to whether any branch of the Government, even one created by a statute, having quasi-judicial functions, subject to judicial review as a history of that case has shown, whether any governmental agency has the power to condemn an organization as subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.351" offset="7544769">But, assuming for the moment that somewhere there is a branch of the Government that can exercise what is really a judicial function, if it is any function, surely that isn't a function of a congressional committee to cite and to declare subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.142" offset="7611956">Again, we say we can't stop the Committee in doing so if it publishes a -- a leaflet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.744" offset="7634317">(Inaudible) Federation against Eastland, which is cited in our brief, indicates that we can't do that, but -- and there is considerable doubt as to whether in the interest of freedom of speech of Congress, we should do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.527" offset="7685517">Although I was involved in the case, I have some reservations about whether it was proper, but to compel people to come forward and make them testify so that a judgment of a congressional committee or any committee, should come down very questionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.830" offset="7742673">Now, as far as the third point, the investigation of political pressure; in short, the Government argues that it has right to determine whether the opposition of Mr. and Mrs. Braden to the security bills pending on the Congress, in our position that many fine people adhere to and that was successful in opposing the bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.558" offset="7825638">But they have a right to determine what this political pressure is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.549" offset="7841520">Now, again we say, this is a -- a complete revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.250" offset="7856358">It is one thing to examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.697" offset="7866180">Overthrow the Government, is one thing to examine things within the formula of force and violence, but to examine political pressure openly made, this we suggest is again not a legislative function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.584" offset="8673677">Now, finally, I want to indicate to Your Honors that the fourth objective, which is called the investigation of the motives of people fighting integration, is again a very harmful doctrine and that we suggest is a non-legislative one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.241" offset="8736371">Now, in the few minutes remaining, because I've have extended myself in this very point, at least we made Mr. Chief Justice, I want to indicate two other basic objections that we have and state them somewhat, some reforms such as of course, to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.694" offset="8798124">The first relates to the vagueness of the resolution creating that committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.938" offset="8819127">And we are of course well aware of what this Court said in Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.615" offset="8841801">We read the Court's language in Barenblatt to mean that based upon the legislative history, not the language necessarily of House Resolution 5 and its predecessor, a legislative history knowledge of which is imputed to the witness, Barenblatt, he should've known that membership on the Communist Party and Communist Party activities as such, were subject to investigation by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.550" offset="8949530">And we suggest that whatever may have been the rule in Barenblatt, this witness could not have known by reading House Resolution 5 and we do not think, by reading the legislative history that questions concerning his motives, questions concerning petitions that Congress were within the ambit of House Resolution 5 and if so, then we say that the statute's resolution was vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.336" offset="9072724">Now, finally, I come down to our reliance upon the Watkins decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.627" offset="9125909">Finally, I come down to our last basic point which is the reliance of the witness explicitly upon this Court's opinion in Watkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.515" offset="9177422">Now, Your Honors again, will recall that this occurred after Watkins and before Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.655" offset="9198007">And we suggest here that where there is the problem of statutory construction, whether we had to impute the word, willfully, to the word as such vague ambiguity itself, into the statute to U.S.C. 192 or whether we had to consider this a matter of due process of essential failed fairness, I think that the latter more than the former, that it is unfair and so unfair as to be a denial of due process to take a witness, particularly confronted with questions like this, take a witness, following Watkins, who has read Watkins and to believe that he could not unreasonably have said to himself, I thus -- this resolution is so vague, it in -- inviolate First Amendment rights that I do not have to obey this -- answer these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.835" offset="9414719">Now, we are told by the Government that Sinclair says that a man takes a risk, but of course, Sinclair with the reliance upon a man's lawyer, he takes a direct risk when he hires a lawyer to begin with and this is very different from following the opinion -- that opinion described by five members of this Court, toward opinion by even three members of the Court and, we think that regardless of whether Watkins has been modified or whether Barenblatt can be reconciled with it, whether the two are consistent, it was not unreasonable, not unreasonable for Mr. Braden to rely upon that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.658" offset="9569991">When one considers the -- the cloud as follows, that cloud is followed in a dispute, among judges, Judge Youngdowd decided that Barenblatt meant what Mr. Braden says in meant, in United States against Peck and indeed, many members of the Congress -- House Committee thought so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.213" offset="9656195">They were fighting for a resolution to give the Committee new authority, the explicit one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.295" offset="9672600">They never pushed it through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.864" offset="9678869">And Congressman Shearer was an active member, a very articulate member of this Committee, said in the course of the hearing which I have hear on investigation of Communist penetration facilities, when somebody mentioned United States against Peck, he said, I will have to take the Fifth Amendment before commenting on that decision, this is Congressman Shearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.870" offset="9762879">The – there was a very great looseness in discussing constitutional rights by this Committee and then he says, but Judge Youngdowd in that opinion said, this witness here today, if he didn't want to cooperate and do the fine job that he is for the Government, consider here and refused that tell us who were the Party, whether at the time he was member of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.157" offset="9839992">He can evoke the First Amendment or refuse to tell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.761" offset="9850441">That is what Judge Youngdowd said in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.071" offset="9859636">Of course, he is following the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.420" offset="9873011">Well, I suggest that Mr. Braden's reliance upon the opinion in this Court, at least, means that essential fairness should not call his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.495" offset="9925360">And I call the Court's attention to its opinion in Raleigh, where he talks about conflicting demands and we think that the opinion of this Court in Watkins, which was a demand which conflicted with at least what the Committee believed was a mandate of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.498" offset="9993383">And of course, Your Honors will recall the two Murdock cases, which we discussed in our brief, where Murdock was acquitted despite the fact that he had improperly pleaded the Fifth Amendment before a federal agency, relying upon the danger of incrimination before a state, because the Court said at 290 U.S., until we had spoken in 284 U.S., the witness didn't know what his rights were under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.964" offset="10099231">Well, we say, he didn't know in this case, unless this Court were to decide to reverse Barenblatt, which of course, we hope it will do, in the proper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.152" offset="10143953">This witness knew no more than Murdock did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.613" offset="10157850">And they say that what I am now suggesting is not to be taken as an indication that we are relying exclusively upon Murdock -- upon the -- the Watkins decision my -- the whole burden thrust of my argument is then that this is a very different case from a Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.293" offset="10232560">And finally in the last minute, let me again suggest to Your Honors, most respectfully, we have had a considerable difficulty in determining whether to make a direct and unambiguous attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.820" offset="10302673">Most differentially of course, upon the Barenblatt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.923" offset="10319078">And, we have indicated why we think that decision was an error and why the entire legislative history of this Committee has been directed toward exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.940" offset="10359097">But we have -- have to say to the members of bar before this Court, that we think, this is a very different case in Barenblatt and while -- to the extent that advocates can, we express our regret at the Barenblatt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.236" offset="10412283">We feel very strongly that this case would be a radical extension of the Barenblatt doctrine going to the heart of the right of petition, the heart of the democratic process and would cover organizations never contemplated by the principle of the violent overthrow of the Government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.844" offset="10486784">I thank, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="5861.179" offset="23548113">Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.580" offset="23557726">Let me state if I understand it boldly, the position of the Government as to these questions other than the one, the Count 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.786" offset="23594506">It is that if the investigating officer or committee has information which it deemed reliable, the directness is connected with the Communist Party or that the organization being investigated has such connections, that he may -- that they may proceed to ask question which otherwise would be barred under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.187" offset="23692100">This Court has with great care in the Barenblatt decision and perhaps some others, carved out a narrow exception, where First Amendment rights maybe disregarded in the interest of the self-preservation of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.921" offset="23755107">If the Government's position is correct, we have taken an enormous leap and no longer do we have the control which is implicit in the Barenblatt and other opinions, but all the -- to protect the First Amendment rights of the witness, but the Government can come in and say, "We suspect you and we suspect your organization and these First Amendment rights vanish."</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.173" offset="23856044">To me, that is equivalent to an abolition of the First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.914" offset="23883003">Now, let us see what has been the history of that question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5950.362" offset="23904841">Twice, this Court has had before it, once it decided and once it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.400" offset="23928978">The Question of the right to interrogate (Voice Overlap) an individual as to things other than the Communist Party -- in -- the one, first time was in the Sweezy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.062" offset="23983626">In the Sweezy case, he was interrogated at certain other matters that quite were for argument here there was interrogation as to the Progressive party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5980.517" offset="24025422">On page 265 of the report of that -- of -- of the opinion, this appears, I believe that Mr. Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion, stating of what the Court the, Supreme Court of that New Hampshire had said, it ruled that that he -- the Attorney General, did posses information with suspicion to reasonably warrant inquiry and citing a as evident to the statement made during the hearings held before him that Communists -- that considerable sworn testimony had been given in this investigation to the effect that the in New Hampshire had been heavily infiltrated by members of the Communist Party and that the pauses and purposes of the Progressive Party had been directly influenced by members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.313" offset="24228655">I need not repeat to this Court what it decided in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.697" offset="24246209">It decided that the interrogation of the witness as to its connection with the Progressive Party was impermissible, notwithstanding this assertion of the investigating authority that it had this information and notwithstanding in fact the state court (Inaudible) you want us for review, had found judicially that he had that thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.457" offset="24353207">The other time in which the question of outside information was sought to be held to justify the disregard the First Amendment rights was in Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.104" offset="24419767">At page 31 of the record in Barenblatt, I got from the library of the Court, there was an attempt made to have a committee investigator testify to the character of the counsel of Arts, Sciences and Professions, which dealt with -- which was dealt with in count number 5 of the Barenblatt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6100.145" offset="24503986">The court below ruled it out (Inaudible) but finally on page 64 of the record, the -- the evidence got in that the witness had knowledge of the counsel of the Arts, Sciences and Profession that in the majority of its officers were a -- a majority of officers who were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.141" offset="24603982">In dealing with that, Your Honors in the (Inaudible) case upon the -- the pertinency and importance of questions 1 and 2, the Court said in the footnote to question 4 which related to membership in the Haldane Club of the Communist Party, was also to the basis to sustain it, but the Court specifically failed to act upon the question where Barenblatt was asked if he was a member of the counsel of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, which is the one as to which the witness had said that it was -- that the majority of its officers were member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6164.449" offset="24761135">Sub silentio and through disregarding count number 5, I take it that this Court expressed either an opinion or adopt that the (Inaudible) utterance of a gentleman like Mr. Arens who appears in this record, that he had cause to believe was not sufficient to overthrow the rights of a witness to normally would possess them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.768" offset="24870431">It would -- if I may draw a comparison from a practice of the ordinary criminal law in which I generally indulge, it would be just as though a member of the alcohol tax unit went to the United States Commissioner and says, "Mr. Commissioner, I have cause to believe that John Smith transports whiskey, give me a search warrant to know what happened there."</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.515" offset="24965413">So I submit to the Court that as to these questions, other than the fifth is a deal or dealt with, other than the fifth count, that there is no basis made here for the disregard of First Amendment rights.</text>
