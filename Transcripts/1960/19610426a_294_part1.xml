            <text syncTime="59.528" offset="341452">The first lawsuit was filed in March of 1956 in the Nineteenth Judicial District State Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.837" offset="722735">These two cases were consolidated at the trial and heard by a three-judge court and the three-judge court rendered an opinion in February 29th of 1960, holding that these two statutes were unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.649" offset="5125935">As I've stated, the State here is in rather bad position to prove anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.150" offset="5155924">The only thing we know about the members are the information that the organizations have filed with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.445" offset="5181106">As I say however, each organization, N.A.A.C.P. affiliate within the State that did file a membership list for a two consecutive year period, shows that the second year, their membership increased substantially over the first year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.018" offset="5255398">Thus, it's rather hard to say that the filing of the membership acted as a deterrent upon membership because they actually increased after each filing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.628" offset="5401893">In order to go behind these affidavits, the State of Louisiana took the deposition of these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.644" offset="5425925">And almost without exception, the testimony elicited from them while under interrogatories and examination, show that these affidavits that had originally filed were no sense correct.</text>
