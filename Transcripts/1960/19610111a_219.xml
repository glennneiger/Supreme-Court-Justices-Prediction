            <label>Mr. Charles J. Merriam</label>
            <text syncTime="13.858" offset="158804">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please, this case arose from two patent infringement cases brought in Fort Wayne, Indiana against Peter Eckrich &amp; Sons, who were -- who were and are an Indiana corporation and resident in Fort Wayne and against the Allbright-Nell Company which was an Illinois corporation having its main place of business in Chicago and not normally subject to service of process in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.909" offset="306970">During the -- there -- there are two cases because one patent issued after the first and was started and was joined in the second case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.584" offset="341661">During the progress of the case was it developed that the Allbright-Nell Company was defending the litigation and controlling it in accordance with a contract which is set forth on Page 2 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.411" offset="409057">Under that contract, it had the right to defend the case to the exclusion of Peter Eckrich and it agreed also to pay all of the damages and costs that might be awarded in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.643" offset="469974">Because of that contract and because of the admission that it was in fact defending, proceedings were undertaken to force the Allbright-Nell Company to answer and it was served in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.619" offset="537893">And after that service, it moved to quash the service to the summons of subpoenaing and that motion was granted on the ground that merely defending the case did not constitute a general appearance and thereby bind Allbright-Nell Company to be sued in a District Court, it was not ordinarily subject to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.983" offset="639352">The Court however gave no opinion and granted an interlocutory appeal in both cases which were then taken to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which decided two-to-one to affirm the District Court and the petition was taken from that decision of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.409" offset="725034">It's our position here that a defendant so named, who after being named as a defendant in the case, continues to control its defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.922" offset="787101">In this case, they even instituted a counter claim in the name of Peter Eckrich asking for attorney's fees, which would have come to the Allbright-Nell Company, is in fact a party and has entered a general appearance in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.789" offset="850526">It is conceded by our opponents and there's no dispute in the Court that Allbright-Nell Company would be bound by the decision under res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.023" offset="899427">That is not contested and I think that perhaps the most pertinent thing in that point is to explore what this Court said way back in Lovejoy against Murray, in 3 Wall. 1,18, was the reason for finding a res judicata against a person who was not a named party.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.097" offset="1019800">And the language of the case which is -- the case is referred to by our opponents, it's not in our brief, but the language is so good that it appears to me that it might be well to read just a couple of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.199" offset="1080195">The Court in quoting from Greenleaf on evidence said, "Justice requires that every cause be once fairly and impartially tried, but the public tranquility demands that having once -- having been once so tried, all litigation of that question and between the same parties should be closed forever."</text>
            <text syncTime="267.432" offset="1173086">And then they, I skip a little bit, "Under the term “parties” in this connection, the law includes all who are directly interested in the subject matter and had a right to make defense or to control the proceedings and to appeal from a judgment."</text>
            <text syncTime="282.423" offset="1233063">This right involves also the right to adduce testimony and to cross examine it, examine the witnesses adduced on the other side.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="290.158" offset="1263992">What is that case Mr. --</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_j_merriam" startTime="291.500" stopTime="427.486">
            <label>Mr. Charles J. Merriam</label>
            <text syncTime="291.500" offset="1269321">That is Lovejoy against Murray, 3 Wall. 1, 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.201" offset="1292204">It is cited in the brief of our opponents and it is also approved in another case cited by our opponents, the Souffront case in 217 U.S. 475.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.103" offset="1355734">In other words, if we go back to establish the basis upon which res judicata is established in this case, and it is admitted that it is here, is because the party who is so estopped is in fact a party and should be treated as one.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.633" offset="1437863">And if that is so, it is our position that when he comes into a case as the Allbright-Nell Company has done here, takes over the control of the defense, examines our witnesses and his own, he should be subject to the right of discovery on our part and he should be subject to the right not to be bothered by other suits brought by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.466" offset="1545279">And as was shown in -- in petition for certiorari 389 which is still pending before this Court, the Allbright-Nell Company did institute a declaratory judgment suit in Illinois on one of the -- on the reissue of one of the patents involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.036" offset="1615496">And it's our position that that kind of thing ought not to be permitted merely by dodging behind the unanimity which the defendant has here in effect established by not intervening as he has a right to do under Rule 24 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.775" offset="1702431">Rule 17 of course says that the case shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest and I gather from the language of the heading which applies both to plaintiffs and defendant that the word “prosecute” is intended to cover both a plaintiff and a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.994" offset="1767320">At any rate, the filing of a counter claim here asking relief for the benefit of the Allbright-Nell Company would seem to well bind it within Rule 17.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.651" offset="4749981">I think a -- a distinction might well be made upon that on the ground that the Allbright-Nell Company was not only defending its contractual liability here, but its own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.266" offset="4800449">And it of course, if there is a judgment of patent validity would be bound by it and therefore, it sells to other people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.758" offset="4874428">So, that's here not only because of a contact but directly in its own interest for other matters and that might be a ground of distinction although we hadn't felt it necessary to make it in the course of counterclaim which is filed here in that -- in the name of Peter Eckrich asking for recovery which would go only to Allbright-Nell Company, is an additional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.208" offset="4960214">We also think it's important to preserve as this Court said in the Kerotest case to -- and -- I haven't got the citation, I have only cited in the brief that there should not be more than one case on the same subject and the war should all be fought out in one spot would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.364" offset="5592795">So that I don't forget it, I would like to first refer to the Dow Chemical case in Mr. Merriam's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.487" offset="5621321">That case did not consider the early authorities that he had just cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.917" offset="5643055">On Page 297 of 281 F.2nd, the Court in the Dow Chemical case cites and paraphrases the Souffront case which Mr. Merriam just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.050" offset="5699584">And they said that the principle of Souffront cannot be extended to satisfy venue requirements and to make one defending an action in the name of another party to the record to settle in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.592" offset="5753710">So, the Court in the Dow Chemical case did consider the older authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.865" offset="5778787">As -- as respondent views this case, we have no question here of statutory interpretation, but that and venue statutes have been interpreted by this Court in Stonite and Fourco and there's no dispute as to the fact that they exclude their -- Section 1400 (b) exclusively governs patent problems and venue cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.929" offset="5871052">And neither is there any question as to whether or not venue or jurisdiction over the person can be waived, either expressly or by a course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.306" offset="5916609">The respondent agrees and concedes that such a waiver can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.951" offset="5939179">Marble and -- the old case of Marble Metals versus -- versus General Electric say that at 287 U.S. 430 and referred to in the Fourco case, clearly sets forth that venue maybe waived by conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.825" offset="5998634">The question before the Court is simply this whether or not in a patent case, the course of conduct which is heretofore, been universally considered not to be the waiver should now be so considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.652" offset="6061955">Now petitioners refuse to meet that problem, they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.025" offset="6083480">They add -- they seem to concede at least in their briefs, I'm not sure what Mr. Merriam's position was during his argument that a manufacture not subject to jurisdiction or venue, they openly conduct the defense of his custom or without waiving its venue provisions if it is not named as a party, but that if it is named as party, the opposite result is reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.617" offset="8893837">In this case, both the plaintiff and Allbright-Nell, I should call the residence and the -- the principle attorneys from both companies are in Chicago and I think Mr. Merriam didn't quite state the whole case when he was asked about suing in Fort Wayne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.168" offset="8971995">The -- the machine that they charged to infringe was in Fort Wayne but it had been manufactured in Chicago and it had been manufactured not obviously before it was sent to Fort Wayne for use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.924" offset="9035107">So, the infringing act that -- that Allbright-Nell could've been charged with was completed and it was done in Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2387.999" offset="9655359">Once there's been a waiver they can't withdraw from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.184" offset="9680123">Now, there are some other problems that arise and they ought to be considered I believe and that is whether or not what effect this would have on the general practice of giving indemnity agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.611" offset="9733831">I think it can be said that it is the general practice of most manufacturers to defend their customers and that in these agreements, the manufacturer usually assumes -- who assumes the financial risk, insist on the right to control of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.793" offset="9810526">Now, first, I think it can't be again said that patent indemnity agreements are socially desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.090" offset="9847724">They ensure retailer or an end user of a manufacturer's products that he won't be subject to a claim for damages and he won't be deprived to his use of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.557" offset="9889625">Let's say, serve to protect a group which are individually weak and who generally can't -- could not afford the expense of conducting a full-fledged defense of a patent infringement suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.333" offset="9940720">Now, they're also desirable because they make it difficult for a patent owner who has a weak patent to assert it against weak defendants because generally, the manufacturer is the one and the only one who can vigorously resist an uncounted -- founded claim of patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.877" offset="10046882">As we have previously indicated, the -- that the manufacturer's only recourse would be the two choices that I said, declaratory judgment or no indemnity agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.855" offset="10094843">And while this might not be anything more than inconvenience to a large manufacturer, it could be disastrous to a small manufacture if he has only the choice of defending himself for pursuing a declaratory judgment suit in a -- in a forum far removed from his home base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.331" offset="10208737">Now, I'd like to look well briefly, this waiver rule that petitioner urges, would probably result in manufacturer's failing to indemnify others and that -- and if that were so, if that notice would be able to select favorable forums and by a series of suits against weak resistance or non-resistance build up a situation where that would greatly strengthen the prima facie validity of their patent and that it would be adjudicated in a weakly defendant suit and each time that happens it gets strong in the next suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.260" offset="10416462">Now, third, I think we should look at what advantages the patent owners get if this rule is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.775" offset="10446451">First, it gives them a virtually unlimited choice of jurisdictions in which they can force a manufacturer to defend the patent infringement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.435" offset="10485112">And it was to avoid just exactly this situation that the venue statutes in patent cases, the present statute and its predecessors were adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.934" offset="10543104">Stonite, 315 U.S., decided in our brief at Page 566.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.540" offset="10573511">This Court commented on the fact that that was the exact purpose of the special patent statute to limit jurisdictions and which patent infringement actions could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.581" offset="10625651">The second patent owner would have a somewhat improved position as far as pretrial discovery is concerned, but they can get that by suing the manufacturer in his own jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.106" offset="10687822">Under the venue statutes, a patent owner can balance the advantage of suing a customer against advantages of obtaining full pretrial discovery against a manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.373" offset="10732857">I don't think he should be given both choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.354" offset="10744769">He can pick the customer where he wants to litigate and either preclude the manufacturer from defending or bring him in as a formal party to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.505" offset="10825435">So far as I've been able to find, this exact case has never -- this exact situation has never been faced by this Court in a patent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.823" offset="10858663">However, I view the Merriam v. Saalfield case somewhat differently than petitioner does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.995" offset="10887398">That was a case involving unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.797" offset="10934523">After the -- if the case was openly defended by the owner of the copyrighted materials that were involved and this is what the Court said after the judgment against the named defendant, a supplemental bill was filed naming the person who had openly defended, a man named Ogilvie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.871" offset="11030862">And the Court said, "Appellant's case on the merits is rested upon the theory that Ogilvie was privy to the original suit against Saalfield and an actual who not an ostensible party thereto."</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.006" offset="11083421">In such a real sense that the final decree there would -- in -- would be res judicata against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.546" offset="11113514">That the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain a suit as against him notwithstanding he resided outside the district because by voluntarily coming in and defending for Saalfield, he had submitted to the jurisdiction and waived the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.997" offset="11175372">Now, that is the argument that was made in the Saalfield case and this Court said, "This sufficiently shows the weakness of appellant's position which upon analysis is found to be this, that upon the theory that Ogilvie will be estopped by a final decree if and when may it sought to bring him into suit before a final decree as if he were really estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.215" offset="11276204">However, convenient this might be to a complainant in appellant's position, it is inconsistent with elementary principles" and they refused to bring Oglivie into the case as a party under the supplemental bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.800" offset="11338585">Now, the Ocean Accident case which did permit the Court and in which the Court did compel the defending insurance company to come in is in many ways distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.909" offset="11407026">In that case, they did not bring, attempt to bring them in until after judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.093" offset="11435760">Also, under the Ohio laws, insurance company was directly liable to the plaintiffs, once the judgment had been obtained against the insured and I think that those are two distinguishing facts that should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.200" offset="11516217">I feel this way, that if the Ocean Accident case stands for what petitioner says, I am in complete agreement with the court below that that course should not be followed because while it might be socially desirable in insurance company cases to avoid the cost of the separate suit against the insurance company, I can see no social desirability invoking that rule in patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.231" offset="11664280">I believe I've already referred to the fact that both petitioner and respondent are residents of Chicago and that I have -- unable to find no explanation as to why the suit is not in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.553" offset="11713599">If it had been brought in Chicago, we wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.279" offset="11732511">I'd like to refer closing to the language this Court used in the Olberding case which is cited at Page 17 of respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.625" offset="11789876">The case is reported at 346 U.S. 380 -- 338 and the Court said, "The requirement of venue is specific and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.302" offset="11832613">It is not one of those vague principles which in the interest of some overriding policy is to be given a liberal construction."</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.379" offset="11864900">While we're not concerned with a direct construction here of the venue statutes, I think we are concerned with the problem which would in effect broaden the venue statutes and I sincerely feel that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.866" offset="12094882">The Winget case which Mr. Rathburn has referred to was one in which the defending corporation was not named as a party and that appears from the opinion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.854" offset="12154755">In the Freeman case, also, it's our position they were not named as a party until after the trial was over when they merely asked to add them as a party to the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.285" offset="12200521">And while Mr. Rathburn has said, I haven't made clear my distinction between the case where they are named a party and where they're not, I'll -- if I have made it clear, I'll say it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.566" offset="12261648">I don't think in justice, there's any real reason for a distinction but if the man is not -- the corporation is not named as a party, then there is no pleading to support a judgment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.393" offset="12320893">And it seems to me that the pleadings must show that he is there and there'd be something of record to show that he is there other than a mere finding and that is held in plenty of these cases that it would be subject to collateral attack merely to make a finding against one not a party that he is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.244" offset="12388394">And that's why I have made the distinction in my argument for Freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.289" offset="12408560">I think in justice that and of course the courts hold that it doesn't make any difference as to being bound.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.054" offset="12943548">In the -- or Merriam-Saalfield case, the naming of the party was not done in the original case, it was done by a supplemental bill and the argument was made if they had a right to file a supplemental bill as an insularly proceeding on the ground that there was res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.381" offset="13020871">There was a good deal of dispute is to whether Ogilvie was still in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.692" offset="13034141">He -- that was disputed but -- and the Court passed it off on the ground we first -- we find there isn't res jusdicata which you allege and second, this isn't an insularly proceeding --</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.462" offset="13121181">At any rate they didn't and the Court didn't answer it and I don't think it would've been applicable under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.437" offset="13145109">All I'm suggesting is that it would be a still nice requirement to -- to suggest to the Court that that if you originally joined a non-coercible party, as a party, then you're before the Court if you really defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.630" offset="13217938">But if you don't originally join but later asked the Court to amend the complaint, you know that's a little bit -- been in -- then you get a little too tied, isn't it?</text>
