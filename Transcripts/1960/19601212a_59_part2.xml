            <text syncTime="99.723" offset="502262">Yes, he's saying the District Court might have gone further.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.014" offset="515427">And as to the point that was made in relation to the statement by the Court of Appeals that, conceivably, someone could believe that this question called for a statement of legal occupation, perhaps, it should be pointed out that Judge Magruder went on to find in this case that a worldly-wise man such as Costello, I'm looking at page 250 now, must have realized that his real occupation was bootlegging and that he's dabbling in real estate was but dust in the eyes to conceal his occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.109" offset="715839">I would like to summarize very briefly some of the testimony that was given in this case which shows, I think, what the nature and extent of Costello's activities were during the relevant period.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.570" offset="773622">Costello got his store in bootlegging in 1921 when he joined forces with one Emanuel Kessler.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.342" offset="808730">Kessler testified at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.294" offset="824508">Kessler was a huge operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.901" offset="838928">He owned numerous boats including an ocean vowing steamer which went regularly back and forth to Europe to bring liquor in.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.414" offset="877066">Kessler testified he brought in about 500 cases a night which he landed on the northern shore of Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.716" offset="910190">And that represents at the going price of liquor, perhaps, $15 million worth of liquor a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.926" offset="943104">Now, Costello and his brother came into this picture, as I say, in 1921.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.635" offset="1093883">I think that -- that -- yes, that he was born in 1890s.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.414" offset="1121050">As I was about to say, Costello joined this operation in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.004" offset="1147382">His role being that he was hired to truck the liquor from its landing place to places of storage at Costello's own trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.867" offset="1194820">They owned storage facilities, a large garage and a large residence which was known as Blackwell Mansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.320" offset="1236616">Now, Kessler went to jail for prohibition violations in 1923 and he moves out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.932" offset="1267127">But the activities of Costello apparently grew a pace because we find Costello testifying that one cash of a quarter of a million dollars worth of liquor, this is a single one owned by Kessler, passed to the hands of Frank Costello after Kessler went to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.494" offset="1341315">Now, Kessler dealt, necessarily dealt regularly with Costello during the period of 1921 to 1923 because Costello was the man who moved all his liquor and stored it all for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.063" offset="1391574">Kessler testified that the Costellos had a Lexington Avenue office, the same office as the realty company has as its office address.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.642" offset="1437968">Kessler was in daily communication with that office and he says it was the headquarters for the liquor operation and that so far as he knew and he went to the office frequently in addition to being in daily telephone communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.912" offset="1495019">So far as he knew, there was never any real estate activity at the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.996" offset="1515395">We get another glimpse of the scale of Costello's bootlegging activities from one Albert Feldman, who also testified in this case, also a bootlegger during the 1920s.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.298" offset="1568580">After Kessler went to jail, Feldman, who had previously purchased liquor from him, began purchasing it from Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.508" offset="1605360">He recalls well in occasion when he went to Costello's Lexington Avenue office to arrange for Costello to pick up, to store and to sell on Feldman's the half a thousand of cases of liquor which Feldman owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.017" offset="1667427">Feldman says he went to Costello because it was well-known in the bootlegging trade that Costello had large facilities for engaging in the liquor traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.471" offset="1713298">Costello accepted that proposal of Feldman's and Feldman says that he remembers the transaction well because Costello told him later that the liquor had been hijacked and Costello thereupon refused to pay him anything for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.754" offset="1778395">There were other witnesses who were involved in the bootlegging trade in the period of the 1920s who dealt with Frank Costello at this Lexington Avenue office, none of whom ever saw any sign of real estate activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.437" offset="1845164">I'm going to mention one more witness at this time, and that witness was a Ms. Helen Sausser.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.814" offset="1878601">She was the daughter of a man named Harry Sausser who died in 1926 and who had been associated that the last years of his life with Frank Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.352" offset="1932831">Harry Sausser, the daughter testified, was the man who arranged for shipments of liquor from Canada for Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.659" offset="1970030">Ms. Sausser was in the Lexington Avenue office as the young lady from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.718" offset="1994271">She testified that this office was the headquarters of the bootlegging operation and that she never saw any suggestion that any other business was conducted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.707" offset="2038157">She also testified that her father never had anything to do with real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.901" offset="2066996">Now, that's particularly significant because Harry Sausser's name was given by Frank Costello to the naturalization authorities as a character witness on the preliminary form.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.526" offset="2129481">Frank Costello listed Harry Sausser's occupation as real -- real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.699" offset="2150170">Though, according to the daughter, Harry Sausser never had anything to do with real estate and certainly, that bears on specific intent on the question whether Frank Costello sincerely misapprehended an instruction when he wrote real estate down as his own occupation, for he wrote the same down for a man who, according to the testimony, never had any relation to the Koslo Realty Company or any other real estate business.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.669" offset="2302098">Now, I've spoken thus far of the testimony of some of the Government's witnesses who were engaged in business with Costello during the 1920s.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.053" offset="2343581">Let me turn now to Costello's admissions on various occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.974" offset="2375241">Mr. Williams has mentioned that in 1938, Costello stated to an Internal Revenue agent that in the 1920s, he was engaged in the liquor business.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.536" offset="2425501">In 1938, testifying before federal grand jury, Costello stated that he had operated a bootlegging enterprise until 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.536" offset="2489553">Now, Costello made further admissions on three other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.319" offset="2512645">And these further admissions occurred after wiretapping by New York State Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.071" offset="2551620">I'm going to refer later to the question whether there was any taint in respect to this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.504" offset="2573354">I'd like to refer -- tell Your Honors first what the substance of this evidence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.197" offset="2608149">Now, there were admissions on three occasions after 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.756" offset="2626435">The first was before a New York State grand jury which was investigating the question of Costello's relationships with Thomas Aurelio in respect to the procurement of a judicial nomination.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.112" offset="2695816">Concurrently or at least very shortly after that investigation, there was a second inquiry which was made by the -- before a referee of the Appellate Division of New York County, this arose out of the same matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.426" offset="2749106">The referee was conducting a proceeding to determine on behalf of the Court whether there were reasons why Thomas Aurelio should be disbarred or suspended from law practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.265" offset="2796440">Costello made admissions again before New York authorities in a 1947 proceeding conducted by the New York State Liquor Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.384" offset="2832906">That was the licensing matter of the date.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.536" offset="2849520">Now, on these occasions, Costello again admitted that in the 1920s, he's been a bootlegger that that has been his activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="724.982" offset="3003329">Essentially, this testimony confirmed Costello's earlier admissions and the specific testimony are given by the people who had done business with Costello in this instant trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.998" offset="3187336">Then I think it becomes understandable that Justice -- that Judge Magruder concluded that from this record, there was no other conclusion possible but that Costello knowingly misrepresented his occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.268" offset="3264449">He could hardly have believed since the Immigration authorities were investigating his moral character that he was at liberty to suppress the occupation which was illegal and which would -- reflected adversely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.038" offset="4483532">I -- I summarized that testimony because it shows -- is -- it's the testimony which shows and there's other of like kind that there was a regular business of bootlegging which was conducted through this Lexington Avenue office that people dealt there on a regular or a daily or a weekly basis depending upon the character of the purchases or the character of the arrangements they were making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.576" offset="4609651">Now, I would like to go on to the question whether a portion of the Government's case, as Mr. Williams has argued, was tainted by the wiretapping which the State authorities conducted in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.955" offset="4703169">Now, again, I think I must give the Court some of the background facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.848" offset="4726784">In 1943, the then New York County District Attorney and also -- still the New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan was investigating suspected criminal activity on the part of Frank Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.751" offset="4810376">And Hogan obtained from the New York courts an order authorizing the New York authorities to tap Costello's private unlisted telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.956" offset="4875160">For some months thereafter, and I think that begin in May of 1943, transcriptions of all of Costello's telephone calls were made and reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.424" offset="4929076">In August or September of 1943, there were a number of intercepted communications which seems to disclose a close relationship between Costello and one Thomas Aurelio, a candidate for a Supreme Court justiceship in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.838" offset="5018728">District Attorney Hogan testified in the instant trial that in all events, there would have been a grand jury inquiry in relation to Frank Costello and his activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.060" offset="5083617">He testified further that when this information, this conversation -- these conversations between Mr. Costello and Mr. Aurelio came to his attention, he decided that there should be a grand -- grand jury inquiry sooner rather than later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.869" offset="5158849">And that -- as a matter fact, one should be held immediately in view of the impending election in which Mr. Aurelio was a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.142" offset="5203989">And so in the fall of 1943, there was a grand jury inquiry into the question whether Aurelio's nomination had been influenced by improper or criminal influences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.579" offset="5265638">And shortly thereafter, there was also the Appellate Division inquiry to which I've earlier made reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.564" offset="5297612">Now, District Attorney Hogan appeared before the grand jury and before the Appellate Division referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.086" offset="5331675">And on both occasions, he did question Costello at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.019" offset="5351424">And he did show him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.524" offset="5365426">And he did read into the record numerous transcriptions which had been obtained from this wiretapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.324" offset="5404714">It does not appear anywhere, however, that any of Costello's 1943 conversations related in anyway to his having been engaged in the bootlegging business some 15 or more years earlier.And District Attorney Hogan testified at the trial of this case that no information of that kind was derived from the wiretappings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.087" offset="5527698">Now, Hogan did go on and asked Costello at the grand jury inquiry and before the Appellate Division referee what his background and what his history were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.787" offset="5586526">Hogan, himself, knew, he tells us, or had reason to believe at least, that Costello had been a bootlegger, he -- that he had word of that from police and other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.123" offset="5655907">Now, petitioner does not contend in his brief and he has no basis for contending on the proof that the 1943 wiretapping revealed any information about bootlegging, which incidentally had terminated according to Costello some 17 years earlier in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.023" offset="5735424">As I've said, the District Attorney of New York testified in this case and the District Court found that the New York authorities got no evidence in relation to bootlegging when they tapped the phone in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.898" offset="5791013">And so what Mr. Williams contention really is, is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.830" offset="7494719">But what he might not had made some statements on the telephone which had something to do with bootlegging or bore on that, and since he would have this lack of servitude as to what he'd said and what he'd been overheard that he might had been induced by that to speak out and tell the truth when otherwise he wouldn't have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.381" offset="7580923">Now, Costello has, of course, has never testified that he felt himself to be under this constraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.434" offset="7601089">But putting that apart, I suggest that the argument breaks down in all events because Costello was under constraint when Hogan questioned him as to his earlier history because he, Costello, had previously stated on at least two occasions in sworn testimony, once before a Revenue agent and the second time, before a federal grand jury that he had been in the bootlegging business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.213" offset="7708191">And so if there was constraint, it came from Costello's own earlier admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.680" offset="7738075">Now, I should like to deal finally with petitioner's request that the Court take into account in its judgement in this case the substantial lapse of time, and it was very substantial, between the date of naturalization, which was 1925, and the date when the Government filed its first denaturalization complaint, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.965" offset="7887182">I think the primary answer to that contention is that Congress has very deliberately decided whether one views its policy in the matter as enlightened or unenlightened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.771" offset="7962415">It is very deliberately decided that there shall be no time bar in respect to the bringing of suits to cancel a certificate of naturalization fraudulently obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.420" offset="8025004">That has been the clear meaning, and I put it to Your Honors, of the cancellation provision since 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.207" offset="8068159">Now, there has been a succession of changes in the Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.227" offset="8092296">But this provision relating to cancellation has remained substantially unchanged for over 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.570" offset="8121657">And the provision as it now reads in the 1952 Act is set out in the Government's brief at pages 3 and 4, the bottom of page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.184" offset="8176097">And the Court will note that this cancellation procedure is made specifically applicable by this subsection (i) to any naturalization granted under the provisions of this subchapter and to any naturalization heretofore granted by any court and to all certificates of naturalization and citizenship which may have been issued heretofore by any court or by the Commissioner and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.623" offset="8849847">And the Congress went on to state that because of the grossness and number of frauds which it felt were being perpetrated that it wanted to do all that the Constitution permitted it to do, to provide that the Attorney General might thereafter cancel any certificate which had been illegally or fraudulently procured in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.065" offset="9171675">This Court had that question before it in the Johannessen case and it ruled that the legislation did plainly contemplate that the cancellation provision enacted in 1906 would be retrospective in application and the Court upheld such an application in the Johannessen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.246" offset="9260387">So, the deliberately rejected language is correct, I think, if in -- in the sense that Congress fully intended to make it applicable as I read the history and as I read the statutory language to any certificate granted at anytime, no matter how remotely in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.194" offset="9360175">Now, if there has been no legislation offered to my knowledge, and I have inquired of the general counsel of the service and he has no knowledge of any bill having been introduced at anytime to establish a period of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.375" offset="9836857">Well, I -- I certainly think, Your Honor, that in situations where a doctrine of laches is applicable and the Government argues that it is not here applicable in view of the policy declared in the statute and in view of the settled policy of this Court that laches would not be applied to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.913" offset="9939048">But in cases in which that doctrine is applicable, then, certainly, one of the things which an equity court requires to be shown before it holds a person barred by laches is that there has been prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.198" offset="10004146">Now, I would suggest to Your Honor that petitioner has not been prejudiced from the standpoint of adequately presenting his case because the burden and let's say, heavy burden, this Court has stated, of proving convincingly that the representation was false is upon the Government and to the extent that the lapse of time or the deeming of recollections makes the case an unconvincing or an unpersuasive one, then it furnishes the basis for holding against the Government and not a basis for holding in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.832" offset="10154715">Now, I think in this case, Costello could hardly claim in the light of his own repeated admissions that he wasn't substantially engaged in bootlegging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.783" offset="10210513">As for his real estate activity, the Government made a complete search of the records and it put in the evidence of the transactions which took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.265" offset="10256384">If there were any additional transactions, certainly, the defense would be in a position to put in records of such transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.412" offset="10293060">Such evidence does not disappear with the lapse of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.773" offset="10314480">And Mr. Williams did suggest, the Government didn't put in evidence showing that this Koslo Realty Company didn't do business somewhere else besides New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.619" offset="10357844">We'll look back there with Costello, himself, testified in the -- before the New York grand jury and his testimony was made a part of this record that he had done a little real estate in New York in Bronx County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.946" offset="10411133">And so the federal agents, who investigated this matter, went through the entire records of New York in Bronx County over the entire period of time involved no small task, something which was necessary because they apparently had no access to any of the petitioner's records if any still existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.053" offset="10503607">In addition, it checked the two other principle boroughs of New York City, Brooklyn and Queens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.111" offset="10535790">So, the -- the Government did investigate every lead fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.167" offset="10556061">There's no suggestion that the defense couldn't have produced further evidence if they're -- if it thought that this investigation had been in any way deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.773" offset="10594513">However, the defense offered no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.049" offset="10607574">I suggest the only additional evidence which could have had some significance in this case is if Frank Costello, himself, had been prepared to testify that for some inexplicable reason, he didn't understand what was meant three times by the directions "state your present occupation".</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.764" offset="10698480">But if -- if there could've been some special explanation, some alibi, some affirmative defense, as it were, based upon his lack of understanding, he's not understanding these words the way any ordinary person would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.242" offset="10764309">Certainly, he was not prejudiced in -- by the lapse time in offering such evidence because he was still here to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.163" offset="10804015">Now, I would like to comment briefly, though I -- I don't think it is a question that the Court had any occasion to reach upon the repeated statement that the Government knew about all this all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.909" offset="10879039">I suppose it all depends on whether one views the Government as a unit in which every finger and toe knows all the time what every other finger and toe and toe is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.120" offset="10951868">Now, it's certainly true that the United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York in 1925 had some reason to believe that Costello was engaged in bootlegging or he wouldn't procured an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.917" offset="11003068">It does not follow that the Immigration Service which was then part of the Department of Labor and was administering records which involved literally millions of applicants for naturalization and naturalized citizens, immediately had a light to go in its office when the U.S. Attorney brought a proceeding against one Frank Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.551" offset="11105573">The only way in which this could've been correlated would've been if the United States Attorney found out in the course of his investigation that Costello was naturalized rather than natural born, if it occurred to him that he might have misrepresented his occupation and if he had brought that to the attention of the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.360" offset="11192822">That is -- is not an automatic kind of correlation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.936" offset="11207137">And it is a difficult matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.359" offset="11212779">I think Your Honor should appreciate to post audit, as it were, hundreds of thousands of affidavits and applications which have been filed, which have been acted upon in the certificates issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.291" offset="11272547">As a matter of fact, the Immigration Service does not attempt to conduct a continuing surveillance of persons who have been naturalized, when fact do come to its attention which makes it believe that there's basis for charging a fraud than it does proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.084" offset="11359692">This record does not show when the Immigration Service first had these apparent discrepancies called to its attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.636" offset="11401906">Petitioner's counsel did make an effort to find that out in -- in what has been referred to as the prior trial, the one which the case which came up here ultimately on the affidavit of good cause point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.948" offset="11471182">And that record, of course, since that case came to this Court is part of the Court's files and the Court has stated, I believe it was in United States against Pink that it was at liberty to look at a record in a prior case which had come to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.972" offset="11551222">And so I called to Your Honors' attention that the attorney who prepared the Government's case and who signed the affidavit of good cause for the institution of this case was questioned at the 1952 trial as to when these matters had first come to the service's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.399" offset="11644949">And in answer to such a question, he stated, and this is at page 48 of the earlier Costello case, "Frank Costello was arrested for bootlegging activities in December of 1925 and subsequently indicted in connection with that arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.423" offset="11729063">A trial ensued and a jury disagreement resulted as to Frank Costello."</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.429" offset="12101047">Well, I -- I think in the first instance that it is perfectly plain that the District Court regarded the Government's affirmative case made out by its own witnesses, people who had done business with Costello, and has made out by Costello's extrajudicial admissions as a complete and convincing case and that the District Court placed no reliance whatever upon the failure of Costello to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.809" offset="12230614">I do not read the Court of Appeals' opinion to say, at any point, that it is necessary to make such an inference in order to sustain the District Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.840" offset="12274709">The Court of Appeals does say that it believes that the District Court might indeed have gone further than it did and made an inference based upon his silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.233" offset="12324342">But the Court of Appeals finds in full agreement as I read its opinion that the District Court's findings were the only findings possible on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.711" offset="12362167">And so, I think, it has placed no reliance from the standpoint of finding the evidence sufficient to justify affirmance on the fact that Costello did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.028" offset="12423502">Now, I'd refer to the fact that Costello if might have testified or might have offered evidence on this point or that if he thought there were additional evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.167" offset="13348028">Question was addressed to counsel during his argument as to the volume of real estate transactions that were engaged in by the petitioner prior to his signing the application for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.198" offset="13412185">The record shows that the realty corporation was formed in October 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.328" offset="13440711">And the record also shows that a number of real estate transactions were engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.409" offset="13469027">But contrary to what counsel said to the Court through inadvertence, the record is quite clear that there was a very major transaction engaged in prior to the first application, the preliminary application for naturalization because, if Your Honors will look at the record at page 24, you will see that the Westin Department building was purchased and that the recollection of the petitioner as expressed in one hearing was that it was purchased for $125,000 and that that transaction was entered into, as the record shows, in the month of December 1924 and that the apartment was sold at the same time as the closing on the purchase was entered into and that a profit was realized to $25,000 by the petitioner himself notwithstanding the fact that he had a partner in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.218" offset="13736208">So that there was a substantial real estate transaction engaged in by this corporation in the terms of reference of the time at which it was consummated some 35 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.799" offset="13782601">And the profit was realized of $25,000 prior to the preliminary application made on May 1 and this was a major portion of the petitioner's income if you'll look at the evidence which the Government offer itself on his income over the 13 years prior to 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.872" offset="13878836">Also, if the Court please, the record shows that this was just not an isolated transaction, that it was followed in sequence by other transactions, one of which was many times greater than this when petitioner, through his corporation, purchased some properties that he erected some major apartment buildings within a few months after his naturalization.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.327" offset="14032645">I might say to you that contrary to the record on his real estate transactions which are most specific, the testimony with respect to the bootleg -- leg transactions do not specify any transactions at all in the year 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.165" offset="14107982">There were some witnesses who testified 35 years almost after the facts which they purported to relate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.186" offset="14140165">Their recollections as you will see from a first reanalysis of the testimony was deemed in vague and most nebulous and attenuated with respect to any of these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.014" offset="14183424">But Mr. Kessler testified only with respect to transactions before 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.506" offset="14205367">Mr. Feldman testified only to transactions before Mr. Kessler's conviction in 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.361" offset="14232848">Mr. McCloud testified only with respect to one Harry Sausser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.658" offset="14249984">Mr. Kelly, another witness testified only with respect to a transaction about whisky aboard a ship called Vinson A. White (ph) and his testimony regarding the petitioner was that he may have overheard this conversation which he had with one spill of coffee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.801" offset="14322604">The testimony of Helen Sausser, the daughter of the deceased Harry Sausser, is most vague and nebulous with respect to the time at which these alleged conversations that she heard between her deceased father and the petitioner took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.857" offset="14386761">They were -- she was dipping back some 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.868" offset="14398882">So that the record is much clearer from the Government's own proof with respect to the petitioner's occupation vis-à-vis real estate transactions which is a matter of record than it was with respect to any bootleg operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.124" offset="14459904">Now, on this question, if the Court please, I think that the Government would interpolate the question to prefix the word "principal" or -- or they would add an S and expect that the petitioner should've revealed all of his occupations that wasn't asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.838" offset="14538689">There was no question directed to him with respect to whether he had done anything which smack of criminality or which partook of immoral conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.289" offset="14572544">This wasn't designed to elicit that information and no question was propounded which was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.728" offset="14598248">On the question of the wiretaps, I would like to restate my position because I'm not sure that counsel has accurately paraphrased it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.596" offset="14641716">My position on that, if the Court please, is that the lower court which considered these wiretaps found in excluding them and holding them to be tainted in the record of the first case of which counsel referred at page 103 found this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.306" offset="14716635">It appears to me that the use of these transcripts vitiated the alleged admiss -- admissions in the aforementioned hearings by the defendant from the standpoint of their use as evidenced in this Court because all of that testimony must be deemed to comprise parts of a continuous process in which all of these records became affected by this illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.218" offset="14812244">The Court of Appeals agreed with the fact that the admissions were elicited by the use of the wiretap records, although saying that the wiretapped records could've gone in because they were state wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.787" offset="14874520">The Court of Appeals said this, "These transcripts suggested that state officers had indeed tapped the defendant's phone in 1943 as a result of which he testified before the three bodies to facts which he might not otherwise have revealed."</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.460" offset="14949230">And the record here shows that the first admission that he made with respect to bootlegging came after he was confronted with a wiretap of a conversation between him and one O'Connell who was a co-indictee with him in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.939" offset="15011088">That comes at page 102 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.958" offset="15023208">When he's confronted with that, he makes his first admission.</text>
