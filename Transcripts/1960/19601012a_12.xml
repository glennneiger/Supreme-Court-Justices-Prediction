            <text syncTime="5.687" offset="126098">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="7.344" offset="132786">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.320" offset="168626">Returning to my argument, I tried to give some further consideration to this problem of separability and see if I couldn't draw upon the decisions of the Court to find a case that might elucidate, illuminate the questions better than I have been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.101" offset="267786">And I thought that it would be helpful to the Court if I would call its particular attention to the case of Electric Bond Company versus the Commissioner, in 303 U.S. 419.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.549" offset="337586">You probably immediately recall that that's the Public Utility Holding Company Act and it provided for a number of things in the Act and one of them was of course registration and another was that they file a registration statement and then there were a long list of other provisions that were also included in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.282" offset="444479">And a very bitter controversy occurred before this Court, which the petitioners in that case, claim that the Act was inseparable and that you had to construe all of the various provisions together.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.036" offset="507486">I make my position clear in this case on behalf of the Government, in telling the Court yesterday that the Communist Party alone could register.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.330" offset="552730">I did not mean to indicate that I was giving up, on behalf of the Government, any of the other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.441" offset="585122">I was trying to make it clear that I thought the Court had the duty, under the law and under its decisions, to take each part of the statute step by step and examine each part since there was a separability provision and determine the validity of each provision as it became ripe because of its properly coming before this Court under its decisions for determination as to each of the various portions.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.428" offset="709047">And I did not mean to indicate, if anyone misunderstood me, that the Communist Party should not be required to register on a statement as the next step after registering as a Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.322" offset="772681">And that then various other provisions of the Act would still be applicable unless this Court determined that they were unconstitutional or invalid in a proper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.629" offset="825866">In such event, and each one that the Court would strike down, would disappear from the Act but the rest of it would be enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.420" offset="869021">I also tried to indicate that I thought that this Court only has before it, limited issues at this time because the other issues were premature and not ripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.376" offset="924923">Now, in the Electric Bond and Share case, we have a case that is exactly parallel on this element of separability.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.292" offset="964524">I'm not saying for a moment that it involved a First Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.184" offset="984064">In this case, it does not but it does involve the -- the problem of whether or not, an Act has numer -- numerous provisions and whether those provisions should be treated separately when the Congress says so in how this Court should Act in such a matter and treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.951" offset="1087195">Well, Mr. Justice Black, I think it could've been in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.817" offset="1114676">It -- the registration statement, of course, required all the kinds of information as I'm sure you are familiar with and a part of that, for example on the Insul Holdings, there are all kinds of fraudulent transactions alleged with regard to (Inaudible) about stock transactions.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="295.583" offset="1285726">Yes, but it also would probably give a lead to who the officers in the Insul Empire were in regard to all of these various transactions that were alleged to be fraudulent about the issue of the Insul stock, if you recall, at that time so that I think there was the problem of whether a registration statement would reveal, although it was not developed in the case as -- as decided by the Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="331.475" offset="1429295">It was not suggested in this as far as the opinion of the Court rules, but it did deal with the question of separability and the duty of the Court to -- where there was such a provision like there is in this case to separate out a portion of the statute that was divisible and you said there was a presumption in that regard and it should be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.114" offset="1555832">And therefore, the statute was found to be enforceable and valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.009" offset="1607450">Well, that's what I mean Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.033" offset="1623542">That was the heart of Chief Justice Hughes' opinion in regard to it and the contention was bitterly made that you couldn't consider a registration and the registration of statement as a separate matter, but you had to -- had to consider them altogether and the Court said, "That was not correct and that you should take those separately.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="406.848" offset="1730748">I understood they were raising and may be I am wrong about it, the place is in fact different, possibly a district case.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.687" offset="1766170">The argument here that I can gather to each of the problems is, what is decided in the Act in Communist Party in fact, amounts -- well, not expressly declare it to a direct money unequivocal practical outlawry of the political party, which at least, in some of the evidences is (Inaudible) small political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.869" offset="1894797">The plaintiffs argue -- argued outlawry and that cannot be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.501" offset="1925413">Only way I see it is to determine that it does not invade the Party and its outlaws and the criminal fee of the Party (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="465.540" offset="1965537">The only way perhaps, that it grieves death certificates to see whether taken as a whole, it does amount with the three outlawing of (Inaudible) when illegal Act relates to Justice Stewart's opinion to -- I recall the Mr. Justice Brandeis -- if he made a crime but you couldn't go all the way to the bridge between them of speak and express influence, simply because some of the activities were illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.661" offset="2105971">I assume that that is done. And assuming that you can only find that out by looking at the whole Act and all of its statutes, how could the Court and members of the Senate merely to registration as the other Parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.177" offset="2172113">Well, Mr. Justice Black, in the Electric Bond case, it was claimed that that was a Death Sentence Act and all of these provisions were so extreme, including prohibition of use of mails for legitimate purposes that it would kill the Utility Holding Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.367" offset="2264795">So the same parallel contention was being made and the Court said the examination should not be made on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.745" offset="2314324">The question was to carry out the will of the Congress and deal with it on a separable basis and take each part and see whether that could be enforced in dealing with the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.767" offset="12762467">Yesterday, an answer to a question from Mr. Justice Harlan, I stated that the question of the privilege would drop out of the case if the Act could be construed as permitting the filing of an unsigned registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.943" offset="12819101">I was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.639" offset="12825893">The question would still remain on the case because Section 7 (d) requires a statement to list the names of all officers and members of the organization, and Section 15 (b) punishes omissions from the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.898" offset="12886915">Thus, if an officer or a member of petitioner prepared a statement, he would be obliged to incriminate himself by listing his name as such even if he didn't sign the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.002" offset="12935398">Again, that the state -- statement was submitted by a lawyer, as Mr. Rankin suggested, the lawyer would have to get the names of the officers and members from one of them and the latter would have to incriminate himself by furnishing his name to the lawyer for inclusion in the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.855" offset="13010840">Hence, there is no escape in this case from a question of the privileges.</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.542" offset="13185546">Mr. Rankin urges that the Court should not pass upon the sanctions now but should await criminal prosecution for their violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.148" offset="13219924">But once the order is affirmed, the sanctions have immediate and devastating consequences from the organization by writing that the way its members through making them ineligible for jobs, passports, making them subject denaturalization of what not, and drives away its contributors and supporters and that it even drives away its potential audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.966" offset="13315218">Thus, if the sanctioned -- as that aren't passed upon now, the patient will die before the doctor arrives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.888" offset="13338937">The organization will be destroyed before the validity of the sanctions would have passed upon and in this aspect this case is entirely different from Bond and Share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.352" offset="13380733">The heart of the Public Utility Holding Company Act was the so-called death sentence of Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.115" offset="13403826">Of that which required, under certain circumstances, public utility companies, when ordered to do so by the SEC to dispose off their operating companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.199" offset="13444159">But that this sentence never came into operation without an administrative hearing before the Section, with all kinds of opportunity for judicial review.</text>
