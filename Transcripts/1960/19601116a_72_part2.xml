          <heading>Argument of A. L. Wirin</heading>
          <turn speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="0.000" stopTime="368.719">
            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1.819" offset="110634">I was beginning to explore for and with the Court the meaning of the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” which is in the present habeas corpus statute as it was codified in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.699" offset="178134">And I'm about to make the argument that the debates in Congress though I realize how -- how cut race inferences from these debates may often be do seem to us at least to indicate that the phrase within their respective jurisdictions means within territorial jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.311" offset="268622">The phrase, which appears in the 1948 revision, first appeared on the statutes -- in the statutes of the United States in 1867 and that appears on the second side, second sheet and first column again, actually our printer wasn't too active.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.819" offset="362663">This first column continued there, but be that as it may, Your Honors will note as the second item there on the second ply sheet 14 statute 385, 1867 and the phrase that appears has an amendment to the habeas corpus statute which originally was adopted in 1789 which we have referred to in the bottom of that column, it appears in the 1867 statute; now a word as to our understanding of what happened in 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.269" offset="520443">Congress was considering an amendment to the habeas corpus statue of 1789 to add a provision that courts may inquire into detention and to determine whether or not the detention violated the Constitution or the laws of United States, a provision which is in Subsection 3 of the present codification that came into the statue, into the law, into the habeas corpus statute in 1867, but that's not the point of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.187" offset="656071">While Congress was considering making some amendment to the habeas corpus statute, as we set forth in our -- the same reply brief on page 11, Senator Johnson of Maryland, page 11 at the bottom page in the footnote and then page 12 also.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.610" offset="741857">Senator Johnson, one of the senators, objected to the bill as then drafted on the ground that it would commit a judge of a District Court to have ordered brought before him a person from anywhere in the United States or substantially to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.988" offset="811342">A judge of the United States Court in one part of the union would be authorized to issue a writ of habeas corpus to bring before him a person confined in another and remote part of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.694" offset="858154">And Senator Trumbull, who was in-charge of the bill, then proposed an amendment to the bill as then drafted, the amendment consisting of the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” and asked the objecting senator whether or not that amendment or that provision wouldn't satisfy the objecting senator, because said Senator Trumbull, it was never intended by the amendment or the statute as then drafted to as we view it, and I'm just paraphrasing, to enlarge the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.129" offset="995871">And if there was any doubt about it, if there was any question about it, the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” would settle that doubt, because it would be clear that there was no intent on the part of the Congress in 1867 to extend or enlarge or amend a jurisdiction which had been narrowly confined territorially up to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.586" offset="1081762">And so that phrase, which was adopted in 1867, have found its -- found itself repeated when the revised statues where adopted in 1875, found itself repeated when the habeas corpus statute was again recodified in the 1940 edition and finds itself repeated in the present codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.980" offset="1179251">And as a matter of fact, Your Honors, the petitioner's position is strengthened considerably in this claim, because as to the inferences or the statements which I have made as to the intent of Congress at that time, there is no dispute between the Government and the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.485" offset="1253334">The Government concedes that the phrase “within their respective jurisdiction” means within their respective territorial jurisdiction and so the question is, where is the difference in the ultimate position between the petitioner and the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="304.444" offset="1321148">The Government says that the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” conceded by the Government to mean within their respective territorial jurisdiction applies only and narrows or limits the authority of the Court “territorially” only with respect to what the Government calls and what was known as common law as the petition for writ ad subjiciendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.071" offset="1419682">And says the Government, the territorial limitation concededly applicable to that writ, does not apply to what the Government says are auxiliary writs which are available to the courts in order to carry out jurisdiction which they have and says the Government the writ ad prosequendum and the writ to testify known in common law is ad testificandum, these are auxiliary writs and hence the limitation admitted as to subjiciendum doesn't apply to auxiliary writs.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.407" offset="1556982">Now we find it difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.357" offset="1560848">We do not accept that – that distinction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="368.719" stopTime="373.389">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="368.719" offset="1578297">When did -- when did the latter two kinds of writs come into the statute, are you going to tell us?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="373.389" stopTime="630.946">
            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="373.389" offset="1596897">Yes, we'll head there.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.991" offset="1607346">The writ by which a court ordered a person to be brought to that court to testify stems from the first Judiciary Act in 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.859" offset="1674846">Now this will make a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.994" offset="1679339">Now if Your Honors will look at our -- our characterization of the -- of the habeas corpus statue of 1789, which is at the -- at the bottom of the second sheet, first column, Your Honors will note that that Act which purported to confer jurisdiction upon judges and the courts, then went on to contain a proviso and the proviso was in two parts, the second of which says or are necessary to be brought into Court to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.809" offset="1802637">Now this is 1789 language and it means writ ad testificandum if the -- if anyone wants to use the -- the common law nomenclature.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.604" offset="1845791">Now then we say, I think that's what we're on to Justice Stewart's question that when Congress made it as we believe reasonably clear or I say, crystal clear but there's no point of overstating or anything made it reasonably clear when it used the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” and was talking about territorial jurisdiction, at that time, the authority to issue writs ad testificandum was in the statute as of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.589" offset="1973687">And we find -- we find nothing in the legislative history of the habeas corpus statue from 1789 to 1948, let alone in the legislative history in 1867 when this phrase was expressly inserted into the statue that anyone in Congress intended let alone Senator Trumbull who was in-charge of the amendment intended that the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” should not apply to the authority to bring a witness into court to testify, but should apply only to the Great Writ, the writ whereby a court inquired as to the authority to obtain a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.279" offset="2140453">Moreover we think Your Honors that to read the statute as if not to look at the statute as it now reads and that's in the top of our page and to see the various sections and subsections and to see their interrelationship and to note that Section A is the Section which confers authority, but which limits authority territorially within their respective jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.403" offset="2244942">Then look at B which is not important, because that simply provides that a justice of the Supreme Court or judge of the Circuit Court may transfer a case to a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.789" offset="2286529">Then if you look at C, it seems to us you can't read C in terms of English construction, in terms of fairness or in terms of common sense except to read it as a clause which is a proviso clause, and that's what -- that's what it was called as a matter of fact in 1789 and that all of the subsections in C of which the authority to bring a person for trial is -- is the last of subsection 5, all of the subsections qualify or modify or is it were to limit the authority originally conferred in subsection A.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.312" offset="2436577">And the distinction between subjiciendum and -- and auxiliary writ, we think must fall because if Your Honors will look at the subsections in C, all of the subsections except 5 deal with subjiciendum, deal with the authority of a court to inquire as to the nature of the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.479" offset="2521318">So we think that the reading which the Government gives to the statute as currently read emasculates the statute and would give to some divisions by one meaning extraterritorial conceding as I think the Government has and will that every other portion of the statute including the various subdivisions one to four are limited territorially so far as the District Court is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.917" offset="3243029">But now in the 1948 what was the old law has become the -- the present law and matters which were segregated in different sections in the revised statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.887" offset="8246941">We think in the first place that Section 2255 was a special statute intended by Congress either to confer or at least to recognize the jurisdiction of a District Court to bring a person before it no matter where he was for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.728" offset="8310262">In the first place, that statute was adopted as a result of recommendations by the judicial counsel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.239" offset="8336280">The judicial counsel, in its recommendations, stated that the -- that the statute contemplated that, first, no rights which a petitioner had theretofore or filing a petition and being brought to Court were to be diminish in anyway, and secondly and more importantly that the prisoner could be brought to the Court where he was sentenced and this would be a greater convenience than requiring witnesses and others to be brought to the place where the prisoner was detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.728" offset="8442232">Then Congress itself though and perhaps language not -- not as clearer as all of us would like Congress to speak all of the time because none of us speak -- no lawyers of this might speak clearly all the time, be that as it may, Congress itself acknowledged the authority of a District Court half holding a hearing under Section 2255 of ordering the prisoner to be brought before it no matter where he was.</text>

            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="2497.703" offset="10094216">I think that neither one of these situations with the same history gives rise to different implications and so before I get into the main part of my argument, let me see if I can see what we think the history of the habeas corpus statute is with this discussion which frankly I do not think it turns completely on the history of the statute but let's see if we can clear it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.503" offset="10197347">Originally, in the Judiciary Act there was the all writs statute and it specifically said that the Courts would have jurisdiction to issue all writs including with the habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.976" offset="10259310">And then went on to say except that the writ of habeas corpus shall not issue to the prisoner in jail unless he is committed under the authority of the United States or trial by the United States or if it is necessary for him to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.508" offset="10329422">So to that extent way back in 1789, it recognized the writ ad testificandum with no particular limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.102" offset="10367770">Now right after that, and possibly by implications before but certainly by 1793, Congress specifically provided as an amendment to that first Judiciary Act that in criminal cases subpoenas which run throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.590" offset="10445720">And so it seems to me that question got that all for writ ad testificandum way back in 1793 because a writ ad testificandum is practically and legally in aid of subpoena power, that is -- it is the means by which you get a jailor to whom the writ ad testificandum is addressed to enforce the subpoena power, the subpoena in a sense same directed to the individual whom you want to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.825" offset="10594722">And so, the rest of the history of the habeas corpus statute, including the 1867 statute really has no meaning to this problem because there were successive grants of powers to federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.692" offset="10674134">First because of the First Act in 1933 for federal officials acting under color of federal law then because an incident involving representative of British power in order a writ to get out of state custody people who acted under the authority of the Federal Government and finally in 1867 the great extension of power which this Court spelled in Aaron against Clark, the one that gave the federal court power to inquire into the reasons why at state is holding a man in detention even under a state conviction?</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.484" offset="10929298">And there was no mention that the writ ad prosequendum specifically referred to in Blackstone mentioned in Ex parte Bollman, but there's really no discussion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.920" offset="10975065">I think this is my guess as to war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.522" offset="11001501">Until Ponzi against Fessenden which was decided in 1922, I think the assumption of the earlier cases is that if a man was in prison under one sovereignty, the other sovereign couldn't try.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.067" offset="11091675">It was so held specifically that in relation to where they just started issue or writ ad subjiciendum to a state prisoner and that Door case as we have, but it's -- one goes through the cases on bail, for instance, there's a case of Taylor against (Inaudible) it's cited in our brief in another connection of this, it seems to me an assumption of those cases and truly it seems to have been the practice that when a man was held in jail by the State, the Federal Government didn't try him and vice versa and the fact is that there were findings of that the power to do this in 1922 when this Court decided in Ponzi against Fessenden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.732" offset="11270248">Now Ponzi against Fessenden was not a case involving territorial consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.639" offset="11293968">It so happened that the federal prisoner from the State of Massachusetts (Inaudible) was in jail in Massachusetts, but in that case Massachusetts' issued a writ ad prosequendum to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.703" offset="11346213">The Federal Government was willing to turn him over and he complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.001" offset="11375365">He said, “I don't want to be moved until I finished here my federal offense” and this Court held that that was not his concern that even though he was going to be moved out of the state jail and into the federal jail for trial that that wasn't a matter of his concern, that was the matter of comity between the two sovereigns about which he had no jurisdiction to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.313" offset="11464600">And the fact this was a subject to that came up to this Court indicates to me that it certainly was not a general practice before 1922 became more general thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.928" offset="11515068">And I assumed this is wrong when the revises were going over the Court in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.772" offset="11558431">When they came to codifying the various section one of which include the provision that it should not issue to a prisoner in jail unless it was necessary for him to be brought up to testify, this -- they've decided well we use it also to bring him up for trial so they put it in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.092" offset="11647770">Now as I say there's no history on this, but this is what seems to me to account for that at the time of revision by 1948 the practice of exchanging prisoners back and forth for the -- for trial was much more common since it had been recognized in Ponzi against Fessenden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.859" offset="11730840">There was going to be more emphasis on the necessity of speedy trial and therefore at that point it was codified into practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.803" offset="11770546">Now let me point out that when this did get into the revision in 1948 the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure had already come into existence in 1946 and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure made it clear that a warrant from a District Court could be served anywhere in the United States so that by 1946, it seems to me, it was already recognized both as to the subpoenas and as to warrants that in criminal cases for purposes of process, the jurisdiction of the Court in criminal cases was nationwide and therefore when the codifiers in 1948 put into provision that the writs were not issued to a prisoner in jail unless necessary to bring him up to testify or for trial it seem to me it put the writs ad prosequendum in a place that I think the writ ad testificandum went from 1943 that it was in aid of federal criminal process and by 1948 federal criminal process ran throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.143" offset="12143992">Now it points out one other thing that was in existence by that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.954" offset="12163218">In page 1920 -- I think it is of our briefs, we've listed the first two of what are number of cases involving corporate summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.982" offset="12215254">Before the rules of federal procedure made any provision for service of the summons on the corporation, the lower court had held, one, that you could get a corporation into Court for a summon by means of a summon although the summon as such was not specifically provided for, and secondly, that that summon could be served on a corporation even though it wasn't doing business in the territorial district of the District Court and they found their authorities from aside that it was perfectly evident from some of the statutes like the Sherman Act and the ICC Act and so forth that Congress intended corporations to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.134" offset="12439907">And they -- therefore it was necessary for corporations to be tried to how to get them before the Court in the normal way of getting them before the Court was by a summon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.555" offset="12485569">Now that question never came before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.800" offset="12498526">This Court referred to those cases in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.221" offset="12516289">In the (Inaudible) case, as if it was definite and it's true the (Inaudible) case as petitioner argues didn't involve the question of jurisdiction -- of territorial jurisdiction, but the vast is that the authority to summon a corporation and to summon a corporation even though it was not within the territorial district of the District Court was simply accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.754" offset="12614405">And those trends of another point by this Court in the (Inaudible) case, it was never questioned at the time the rules went into effect in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.611" offset="12653798">And so again this is just one other illustration of the fact defined in 1948, I think it could be taken as established or at least certainly recognized in many different situations subpoenas, warrants, corporate summons that jurisdiction of criminal court for the purposes of process and was not territorially confined.</text>

            <text syncTime="4428.671" offset="17818102">To request, I think it's probably more accurate term in the state situation, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.572" offset="17845687">And it seems to me the alternative as I see it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.763" offset="17874422">The alternative is that if a defendant in this situation where he's given a bond does not appear because he is in state jail, a District Court would be obliged to declare a forfeiture of breach of the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.381" offset="17964910">Now, there's a lot of technical law on when and when that forfeiture would stick in the sense of collecting $100,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.170" offset="18008064">Now I don't think it's important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.326" offset="18016632">The fact is that if he failed to show up whether it was a conceivable forfeiture or not would be agree to this bond, the District Court of California would then have authority on questionable to issue a warrant of arrest on people in appearance which was one throughout the United States as soon as the State of New York chose to allow the Federal Government to serve that one it could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.970" offset="18147244">Well, there is no advantage and it seems to me as long as that is possible and it clearly is, then the writ of habeas corpus on the narrowest concept to jurisdiction is in aid of the jurisdiction to get the defendant under his bond in the sense to make it unnecessary to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4785.713" offset="19246268">That I point to Your Honor and I think considering the purpose for which this particular writ was issued in this case, I say that not only in full but in actuality petitioner has no standing and that it does not run because this is a writ to the jailer to enable to -- petitioner to do that which we should -- he was under a legal and contractual obligation to do if he were not in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.434" offset="19409063">And in a sense all it amounts to is getting the permission of the State of New York to allow petitioner to do that which he should've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.306" offset="19456606">And for that reason, we say that in this situation, petitioner -- one, not only does the Court have power to issue the writ but two, petitioner has no standing to challenge it because his obligation to appeal exists by virtue of the indictment, by virtue of his bonds and by virtue of the jurisdiction of the Court in that criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.178" offset="19576038">And the only function of the writ here is what it -- is directed to the jailer and it happens to be called the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, but it was called a letter, if it was called an order, anything of that sort, it is merely a means of allowing the State of New York, of getting the permission of the State of New York to allow petitioner to do that which he was obliged to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.173" offset="19700067">And so in this situation as I say, both -- it seems to me, both that the Court had authority to issue the writ and the petitioner has no standing to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.349" offset="19744789">And let me just say that in our view, this whole question was settled by the Court in the Hayman case because in the Hayman case, the Ninth District Court of Appeals has held that the added remedy under 2255 was inadequate, as a substitute for habeas corpus because it said, "There are situations in which there has to be a hearing in the District Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.782" offset="19866520">And usually, prisoners are also or often prisoners aren't confined in the district in which they were convicted and therefore, there won't be any authority in the sentencing court to get the prisoner before them for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.298" offset="19948544">This Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.464" offset="19957217">The Court is not impotent to accomplish that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.427" offset="19973099">Congress made it clear that it intended a hearing to occur and by virtue of that fact, the Court has power to do that which is necessary to get a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.596" offset="20033808">And it appears from the quotation on page 25 of our brief, the Court pointed out that an order for the prisoner to appear in such situation is not the same as the initiation of an original writ of habeas corpus, in other words, standard habeas corpus ad subjiciendum proceeding, and said, and this is a quotation on page 25, "The very purpose of Section 2255 is to hold or require hearing in the sentencing court because of the inconvenience of transporting court officials and so on."</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.954" offset="20187199">The District Court is not impotent to accomplish this purpose, at least so long as it may invoke the statutory authority of federal courts to issue "all writs" necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.685" offset="20270164">I think the Hayman situation applied equally here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.921" offset="20291062">The jurisdiction of the district courts of the Southern District of California stem from an indictment returned by grand jury then you -- and this jurisdiction is fixed by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.127" offset="20359920">Now there's another thing that the Constitution commands, and that is that the prisoner be given speedy trial as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.991" offset="20407359">Under those circumstances, since the Court has jurisdiction of the courts of action, since it has a duty to try the man as feasibly as possible, it has, we think necessary, that necessary to that jurisdiction is the authority to request the State of New York to allow petitioner to be tried and that's all the writ is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.344" offset="20552704">It's a request to the State of New York to allow petitioner to be tried as he would've had to sue if he were not in jail.</text>
