            <text syncTime="29.976" offset="223274">The question that's presented to the Court in the case at bar concerns the admissibility of evidence in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.808" offset="278653">Precisely stated, the question is whether evidence which is obtained by agents of the Federal Government by the use of this electronic eavesdropping device which his known as a spike microphone which was inserted into the party wall of the private dwelling house of petitioners so that all of the conversations which took place in that dwelling house over a period of days could be overheard by the federal agents, whether evidence of that kind may be offered against the petitioners in a criminal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.744" offset="546356">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.270" offset="560462">In July of 1958, the petitioners were indicted for violation of the gambling statutes of the District of Columbia and for violation of the Federal Gambling Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.888" offset="630888">The indicted sounded in four counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.127" offset="643845">They charged the petitioners, in substance, with accepting over the telephone wagers on baseball games and boxing matches.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.799" offset="686582">It charged that these were accepted in a row house at 408 21st Street, Northwest in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.034" offset="727542">The house was a two-story dwelling house with four rooms, two upstairs and two downstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.205" offset="764217">On April 30 of 1958, a search was made of these premises pursuant to a search warrant issued by the United States Commissioner for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.560" offset="817612">As a result of that search, certain records were seized and certain -- certain paraphernalia were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.494" offset="849377">The search warrant was issued, if the Court please, on an affidavit that was signed by two agents of the Bureau of Internal Revenue Service and by an officer of the Metropolitan Police Department and, it alleged in essence that over a period of nine days from April 21 to April 30, from a vantage point, otherwise unidentified, they were able to overhear conversations in which the petitioners were engaged and which they characterized as wagering conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.175" offset="1008097">A motion was filed under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the return and the suppression of evidence, for the return of the physical object seized in their suppression, and for the suppression of the conversations overheard on the ground that they were in violation of petitioners' rights under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.456" offset="1137246">That motion came on for hearing before Judge Holtzoff of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.493" offset="1169324">At the hearing, a stipulation was entered into by counsel for the Government with counsel for the defense that agents of the Federal Government had gone onto the premises at 410 21st Street which was the row house immediately contiguous to the petitioners' that they have gone unto those premises with the consent of the owner and that, by use of this microphone, they had overheard the conversations which were spelled out in the affidavit on which the search warrant was issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.646" offset="1593971">And that was annexed, if the Court please, to the original application for a search warrant made by the officers who applied for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.860" offset="1638797">That was the affidavit on which the search warrant was issued by the United States Commissioner on April 30, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.117" offset="1667845">We annexed it as an exhibit to our moving papers because we were making the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.094" offset="1699715">It was further stipulated that this was inserted below the baseboard for a distance of six or seven inches into the party wall of petitioners' dwelling house and that it was the means by which the conversations were overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.522" offset="1773484">Judge Holtzoff denied the motion for return and suppression and I think it is germane here to read just a sentence of his opinion or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.165" offset="1824057">He said, "By permission of the owner," and I'm reading from page 20 of the record, "police officers obtained entrance to a portion of the premises which adjoined the search premises, and attached an electronic device to the inside wall of the adjoining premises with a wire projecting six or eight inches into the party wall between the two houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.938" offset="1903156">By means of this electronic device, the officers were able to overhear conversations that went on in the suspected premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.597" offset="1933772">These conversations were made the basis of the affidavit in question."</text>
            <text syncTime="461.940" offset="1951117">And then, below on the same page, he gives us the reason for his denial of the motion before him."</text>
            <text syncTime="469.899" offset="1982986">The provisions of the Fourth Amendment relating to search and seizure are limited to physical searches and seizures of objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.471" offset="2021230">This has been continuously held by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.941" offset="2035127">Thus, in Olmstead against the United States, the Court laid down the general proposition that if evidence is obtained by use of sense of hearing and that only, and there is no entry into the house or office of the defendant, there is no unlawful search and seizure."</text>
            <text syncTime="499.284" offset="2100537">And, again at page 23, he says, "The state of the law today, so far as the Supreme Court decisions are concerned, is that the constitutional limitations on searches and seizures do not apply to conversations and are confined to physical invasion and to the seizure of physical objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.243" offset="2192384">The Fourth Amendment does not ban eavesdropping."</text>
            <text syncTime="528.075" offset="2215685">If the Court please, by reason of a technical defect in the indictment, a superseding indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.741" offset="2250376">The technical defect is not germane here but a superseding indictment was returned in five counts and the same motion was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.731" offset="2286320">This time, it came on for hearing before Judge Youngdahl of the same court.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.892" offset="2302934">Judge Youngdahl announced that he felt himself bound by the rule of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.869" offset="2318817">He did not hear argument on the motion and entered an order dismissing the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.954" offset="2347238">The case then came on for trial before Judge Jackson of the same court.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.711" offset="2366255">The motion was once again renewed before the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.599" offset="2385795">He, feeling bound by the rule of the case, denied the motion and the case proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.126" offset="2415888">At the trial, if the Court please, oral evidence of the conversations which were overheard, to which the petitioners were parties, the conversations which were overheard by means of this device were offered by the prosecutor and received into evidence against the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.797" offset="2510555">I think it is a fair statement of the record to say that these conversations constituted the bulk of the oral evidence given against the defendants in the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.278" offset="3416482">Now, at the trial, these facts were developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.857" offset="3434768">The officers had gone onto the premises at 410 21st Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.457" offset="3453158">They took this device and they probed underneath the baseboard to find a place where they could insert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.567" offset="3485654">They found that they hit masonry or brick and that they could not insert it except at one place, two-feet back from the front wall, for a distance of nine inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.749" offset="3530376">And there, they could insert it and went into the wall until it came into contact with a surface which the officer said gave meaning that it was resilient.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.464" offset="3581262">Now, the record shows that, at this particular point, the heating duct of petitioner's premises ran through the wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.449" offset="3621177">Brick was channeled out so that the duct could run through the wall and directly behind where the officers were inserting this microphone was the heating register for the petitioner's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.095" offset="3675721">They lay the tip of this needle against the heating duct and they converted the heating system into a giant conductor of sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.608" offset="3709785">They made every register in the premises at 408 21st Street a microphone so that as the record shows, they were able to hear conversations in every part of the dwelling house at 408 21st Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.963" offset="3763179">And, in order to reach that heating duck which they suspected they were heating, they had to go in for a distance of seven and one eighths inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.124" offset="3807901">An inspection of the premises, after the fact, showed that sure enough, there was an oval indentation under the baseboard which precisely fitted this needle and, if the needle were pressed through to its point of contact, it came into contact in direct line with a perforation in the heating duct of the petitioner's premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.014" offset="4311437">They then carefully probe the brick wall between the two houses in search of an advantageous spot for the insertion of their eavesdropping device, a needle or spike about 12 inches long connected to an amplifying duct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.320" offset="4368697">The testimony indicated that the spike, in order to serve its purpose adequately, had to come into contact with a solid object capable of resonance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.898" offset="4402970">Mere insertion in the plaster or brick of the wall would be ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.958" offset="4419166">The desired sound reception was obtained by inserting the spike about seven inches into the party wall under the baseboard at a point where the wall contained the metal heating duct for appellants' house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.252" offset="4468381">The heating duct was an excellent vibrator and, furthermore, ran into the bedroom as well as the living room of appellants' house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.163" offset="4496071">Every inference in what little direct evidence there was pointed to the fact that the spike made contact with the heating duct, as the police admittedly hoped it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.143" offset="4531911">Once the spike touched the heating duct, the duct became in effect a giant microphone running through the entire house occupied by appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.691" offset="4566183">The spike was the conductor by which the sounds in appellants' house were transmitted to the amplifier in the adjoining house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.587" offset="4593768">Conversations on both floors of appellants' house were clearly heard by the police through earphones attached to the amplifier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.649" offset="4649984">This was denied and, finally a petition was filed here and granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.401" offset="4669001">Now, four times in the last three decades, this Court has considered what I think can be described as closely analogous facts and a closely analogous question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.042" offset="4755519">In 1928, this Court decided the famous case of Olmsted against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.263" offset="4792404">The Court will recall that in that case the contention was made by the petitioner that the interception of his telephone conversations and the reception of those conversations in evidence by the trial judge violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.587" offset="4881742">The Supreme Court of the United States rejected that contention by a vote of 5-to-4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.574" offset="4929703">Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice Brandeis, Mr. Justice Butler and Stone dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.186" offset="4956139">In almost with unerring prophecy, three decades ago, Mr. Justice Brandeis foresaw the factual situation in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.517" offset="5009429">When he said time works changes, it brings into existence new conditions and purposes.Subtler and more far-reaching means of invading privacy have become available to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.394" offset="5060942">Discovery and invention had made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon their Act to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.036" offset="5107545">In the application of a constitution, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of what may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.351" offset="5140773">"Ways may someday be developed," says Mr. Justice Brandeis in his opinion, "by which the Government will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home."</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.590" offset="5209736">14 years went by and there came before this Court the Goldman case in 1942, decided shortly after World War II began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.634" offset="5265951">In that case, the petitioner claimed and complained that a detectaphone had been planted against the wall of a contiguous office and that agents of the Federal Government had listened to his conversations in the next office and that this evidence had been offered against him and that this was violative of the Fourth Amendment and that this case was distinguishable from the Olmsted case because of the fact that he did not foresee that such an intrusion into his privacy could take place because he was not projecting his voice over the telephone beyond his office but having a private conversation with a man in a room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.398" offset="5448913">The Court, by a vote of 5-to-3, rejected his contention with Mr. Justice Murphy dissenting and Mr. Justice Frankfurter joined with Mr. Justice Stone articulating the fact that if the majority of the Court had seen fit to overrule Olmsted, they would go along but, since the Court did not, Olmsted was controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.053" offset="5543581">Now, the philosophical rational behind these cases, I think, is fair to say was that the Court felt that the penumbra of the Fourth Amendment did not cover conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.929" offset="5607111">It did not cover things other than material, physical, tangible entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.720" offset="5630203">But in that case, there was articulated in the dissent with, what I think was irrefutable logic by Mr. Justice Murphy, these sentiments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.919" offset="5699062">It's a strange doctrine that keeps inviolate the most mundane observations entrusted to the permanence of paper but allows the revelations of thoughts uttered within the sanctity of private quarters thoughts, perhaps too intimate to be set down even in a secret diary, or, indeed, utterances about which the common law drew the cloak of privilege the most confidential relations between husband and wife, client-lawyer, patient-physician, penitent and spiritual adviser nor can I see any rational basis for denying to the modern means of communication the same protection that is extended by the amendment to seal letters in the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.117" offset="5867813">Again, it was 10 years before a comparable situation came to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.664" offset="5894040">In the On Lee case, decided in 1952, this Court had to consider whether a violation of petitioners' Fourth Amendment rights took place when an informer went on to petitioners' business premises, engaged him in a conversation incriminatory in nature, all the while having concealed on his person a radio transmitter which was carrying this conversation to a federal agent who had secreted himself beyond petitioners' premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.135" offset="6031862">The Court, by a vote of 5-to-4, rejected petitioners' contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.212" offset="6056208">The place was a public place to which the informer was invited and one of the parties in that instance had consented to the transmission of the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.553" offset="6097586">But, it is very significant that in the brief filed by the United States by the Solicitor General, he sought even at that early stage, almost a decade ago, to distinguish that case from a case such as the one that is presently before the Court when he said, in his brief, the various situations envisaged in the dissenting opinion in the Second Circuit where mechanical contrivances are used to publicize conversations within a private home are unrelated to the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.319" offset="6232691">As has been observed here, a private home is not here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.190" offset="6248155">The conversation transpired in a place to which the public was invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.563" offset="6265605">In any event, science should in the future, perfect instruments which seriously invade truly private conversations, the validity of such developments may be considered as they appeared.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.544" offset="8089579">That a party wall is no more or less than a joint investment by contiguous owners in support and privacy and that if the party wall is abused or if its purpose is aborted by either party, either by invading into the support or invading into the privacy of his neighbor, then there is a trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.905" offset="8191039">All walls have, as I understand it, three functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.010" offset="8203368">One is for support, one is for security against intrusion by animals and elements and strangers, and the third is for privacy, auditory and visual privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.951" offset="8243179">Now, a party wall has, for its purpose, support and auditory and visual privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.330" offset="8268675">And, when one owner uses the party wall to invade the privacy of his contiguous owner by inserting a device of this kind, I say there is a trespass because if the Government's contention is true, if the Government's contention is true, it means that the Fourth Amendment gives no protection -- auditory protection to persons who live in row houses, tenement houses, apartment houses, or rooming houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.275" offset="8424469">The Fourth Amendment would then protect only those persons who lived in private dwelling houses, the walls of which were self-sustaining and wholly apart from other walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.942" offset="8467101">It would mean that in multi-family dwelling units, in order to be absolutely certain that one was having a private conversation, it would be necessary to adjourn to a room insulated in tinfoil, a windowless, heatless room and hold conversations where a device of this kind could not penetrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.701" offset="8562186">I don't think that the Fourth Amendment can be construed to extend its protection solely to those persons who live only in self-standing, individual, private dwelling houses which do not have any party walls.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.677" offset="11746095">As I understand, the Fourth Amendment guaranteed the right of the people to be secure in their homes against unreasonable searches and seizures, but a necessary qualification of that right was that warrants might issue on probable cause to conduct a reasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.329" offset="11816730">But historically, as I understand the origin of the Fourth Amendment and the decisions under it, warrants of search issued in common law solely for contraband, fruits of crime, and instruments of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.861" offset="11890813">And, I think that when the founding fathers wrote the Fourth Amendment into the American Bill of Rights, it was in this frame of reference and they never intended that officers of the law should be given ingress into the home of private citizens so that they could fair about in a search for evidence of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.721" offset="11962284">I don't believe that, and so I say that if the Congress should pass such an Act authorizing warrants to issue or this kind of a search, that there would be a grave constitutional question which would be presented to this Court, notwithstanding the existence of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3064.902" offset="12363003">As Your Honor is very well familiar with, in the McNabb case, this Court decided that, notwithstanding the fact that there had not been a constitutional violation of McNabb's rights by the illegal detention and by the reception in evidence of what otherwise was a wholly voluntary confession that this Court felt, in the exercise of its powers over the administration of justice over the lower courts, that it should exclude this kind of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.018" offset="12503437">I suppose, and I don't know, that the philosophical rationale behind this was that this Court has forever found upon the tenant that the end justifies the means in the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.014" offset="12563414">And when a confession was obtained as the result of an illicit means, namely, the illicit detention of Petitioner McNabb, this Court was unwilling to allow the Government to enjoy the fruits of that illicit act and, therefore, invoke the federal exclusionary rule to strike it down and I feel that the case at bar is an appropriate case for the invocation of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.769" offset="12682428">For these reasons, I respectfully request that the Court reverse the judgment in the case at bar for the reasons which I have outlined during my argument that it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment or alternatively, the Fifth or in the exercise of its supervisory power that this is the kind of evidence that should be excluded from a federal courtroom in this land.</text>
