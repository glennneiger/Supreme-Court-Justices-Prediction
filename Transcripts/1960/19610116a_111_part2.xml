            <label>Mr. George J. Todaro</label>
            <text syncTime="2.154" offset="111992">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.708" offset="118157">Just before luncheon recess I was reading this Court's opinion in Benanti versus U.S. and I got to approximately disposition in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.361" offset="168835">Moreover, we're referring to Section 605 here, the very existence of these grants of authority to the State, underscores the conclusion that had Congress intended to allow the State to make exception to Section 605, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.197" offset="256188">In the light of the above consideration and keeping in mind this comprehensive scheme of intra -- interstate regulation and the public policy underlying Section 605 as part of that scheme, we find that Congress setting out a prohibition in plain terms, did not mean to allow a State legislation which would contradict that Section and that policy and it cited Pennsylvania versus Nelson and Hill versus Florida and Hines versus Davidowitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.374" offset="396831">The authorities cited are impressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.057" offset="411564">It is therefore clear that in Benanti, this Court has held this constitutional legislate -- legislative provisions by the state of New York to be an invasion of a field preempted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.864" offset="478856">And I might at this juncture quote from Judge McDonalds in his -- in his opinion in granting the temporary stay, when he referring to the Benanti case he said, "Moreover, the fact the wiretapping is authorized pursuant to the constitutional legislation of the State of New York, pursuant to which New York judges continue to order wiretapping and police officers do the wiretapping and that was the condense of wiretaps in their testimony, even after the Supreme Court has held these constitutional legislative provisions to be an invasion of a field preempted by the Congress, makes the position of the defendant even more on tenant."</text>
            <text syncTime="139.518" offset="661400">If that be so and if the statute permitting wiretapping by State police, pursuant to a court order is -- has been nullified by Benanti, if they cannot orbit in the same field, then by what authority has the State of New York presumed to invade the right of privacy of the individuals in there -- residing in their state.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.709" offset="762232">By what authority can -- they haven't even got the summary of their own local laws or state, because this Court had ruled that they cannot legislate in the field that Congress has already enacted, the best (Inaudible) 605 particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.109" offset="843839">And of course, if I may say that the Hill versus Florida was along Labor Relation Act and in that case, this Court stated, our holding is that the National Labor Relation Act in Section 4 and 6 to affirm the Act as here applied, cannot move freely within the orbits of their respective purposes without -- without impinging upon one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.007" offset="955434">This is one of the authorities cited by this Court in Benanti, then also Nelson versus -- Hill versus Florida, no, Pennsylvania versus Nelson that was a sedition statute based upon Pennsylvania's legislature, which was stricken down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.303" offset="1036622">So, it is apparent that this Court has ruled that Congress has preempted the field and the State of New York has no power to legislate in a field that has already been preempted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.723" offset="1086255">So that they are acting without even the semblance of legality and then proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.819" offset="3130598">Your Honor I would like at this juncture to read a portion of the opinion of Judge Clark of the Circuit Court below, who was -- who dissented from the -- the opinion of the majority in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.470" offset="3193292">I think it sums up my case beautifully and I would rest my entire case on his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.229" offset="3220250">He does a masterful job by the way and he states, referring to the Benanti case, goes into the fact of -- on the Benanti -- that Congress setting out a prohibition plain times did not mean to allow a state legislation which would contradict of that section that and that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.093" offset="3307708">And it points out the failure of Congress to grant exception, though strongly importuned to do so and this is cited in Benanti in the various attempts made by the Attorney General of the United States and various other officials that have Congress change the law and their failure in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.089" offset="3387747">Then he goes on, notwithstanding his decisive character there is nothing surprising in the court statement, indeed it would have been surprising that the court said less, for the absolute character of the prohibition has been steadily emphasized over the years and the attempt to make the statute to say less than it does, as been conspicuously unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.476" offset="3473324">So, we must accept the interpretation, the wiretap whether by state or by anyone else, is simply and shortly forbidden by the federal law subject to the severe penalty of fine and imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.028" offset="3523480">Attack must therefore be limited to the meaning on law -- of new legislation because of its hampering effects on law enforcement and prosecuting officials cannot have the benefit to at least control wiretap.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.925" offset="3575097">Involve the surely way, you're arguing with public policy, which a legislative body should weigh, but these arguments have not yet prevail with the only governmental agency having authoritative act to modify the existing law and I do not see how they can affect the responsibility of the United State judges to enforce that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.519" offset="3649494">Hence, for us I see no escape, but to start with the premise that we are faced with repeated open and acknowledged violation of federal law, which we are assured would be continued until and unless the fellow authorities intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.227" offset="3708322">Thus we have an absolute impasse going to so far as to be almost ludicrous if the issues were not so fundamentally serious and it further states, in sum it is beyond dispute that the there is a general indeed universal custom of federal law violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.518" offset="3785435">Now this is distress in situation, may not less so that in the eyes the many were they seated, it this required by the assertive existence of successful law administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.346" offset="3828799">But it is not an unusual situation for -- actually it is a clash between federal and state governmental policy, as such its recurring struggling our history and quite possibly a necessary one to a federal form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.558" offset="3885641">In the past, we always found ways and the meaning in solving the problem, of course there are several forms of remedy, but the one to which seems to which there seems continued return when other remedy fails is the resort to the equity powers of the federal court to enjoin repeated violation of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.893" offset="3962964">This and all the well-established run of equity jurisdiction naturally to be resorted to only reluctant as against state official, but nevertheless thoroughly recognized and then because it cites a number of cases and then prefers to the – draws analogy between the segregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.110" offset="4055855">Now a further statement, all these question of jurisdiction the majority he would concede including the -- irreparable injury sustained, I thorough -- I agree thoroughly with the principle he has stated, but that only leaves -- that leaves only Stefanelli versus Minard 342 U.S. 117.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.253" offset="4136417">And the question of the nicety of the exercise of federal equity jurisdiction and left -- left to have give us pause, but Stefanelli recognizes the jurisdiction of equity and emphasizes only the restraint which a federal court show against interfere with the state criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.834" offset="4206738">I agree whole heartedly but answer as was asked with respect to Little Rock School, martial-law and then Texas Oil Fields, another historical federal-state clashes when does enough of federal law violation become too much?</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.561" offset="4265566">The fact rehires above demonstrates in my opinion that the only -- that only by the course of federal injunction will the present and past be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.741" offset="4306317">Schwartz versus Texas shows that the way is not by appeal from a conviction already had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.775" offset="4338500">Indeed it confirms the view that this is the only -- that this is the one healthy and direct and complete solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.800" offset="4370578">A clean excision is better than a continuous manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.230" offset="4388342">Involving Stefanelli was an isolated case of federal law violation, not a consistent pattern as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.947" offset="4415195">Also, to be noticed the less directed direct compulsion of federal law the essence the Fourth Amendment does not touch the problem of communication and evidence -- as evidence is direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.799" offset="4462529">No federal claim there was involved and that damage had already been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.224" offset="4480293">Carefully consider, our regards to Stefanelli is authority shown than need and the utility of the action I urge rather that the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.746" offset="4518327">And then it goes on consequently I'm persuaded by would follow the good opinion Judge Medina upon the grant of stay in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.331" offset="4548733">I also note that two state justices have reached like conclusion the -- and declined proceeds further in wiretapping and then refers to the Hubsteder and Judge Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.184" offset="4588126">This case not only illustrates the uncertain and anomalous position that which state judges now trust, but also a good example to United State judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.707" offset="4626160">In the first case cited here Mr. Justice Hubsteder makes a very pointed illusion to the mandate of the United States Constitution and the laws made pursuant to it, are the supreme law of the land binding upon us all, anything in the constitutional laws of any state of the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.809" offset="4714559">For my -- and it further states -- for my part -- no and it further state this reminder from a distinguished state board of the necessity for obedience of the supreme law or to go far to a later fear expressed that state official will defy this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.419" offset="4777044">Even after there's been (Inaudible) defying in the cause of this litigation and that the fellow cause would be flooded with action that curve this defiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.489" offset="4813302">On my part, I entertain no such fear of violent defiance or the flood of cases and then as I full comment, I forgo comment on the implication of mere number of application may bar the right of equity relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.809" offset="4866591">On the contrary, I venture to believe that our state brothers and colleagues in law enforcement, more than a bench in the prosecuting office will work definitive resolution of the present hopeless stalemate and will haste come to comply with the requirements of law as soon as they are made clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.487" offset="4961364">Your Honor, I want to reserve a few minutes time for rebuttal, so I'm going to stop at this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.020" offset="5283401">Now when Ms. Riss was able to be interviewed, she told the police that she had been courted for several months by the petitioner, Burton Pugach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.329" offset="5352678">That when she discovered that Pugach was a married man with a child, she made it known to him that she was no longer interested in his -- in her -- in his affections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.677" offset="5430105">Pugach told her that she would receive the same treatment as was given to Victor Riesel, the innuendo, especially in the light of subsequent developments, was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.371" offset="5500844">Victor Riesel was a newspaperman in New York, who had written a series of articles on gangster control of certain labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.511" offset="5553403">By way of reappraisal, those gangsters threw acid into Riesel's eyes and he was blinded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.811" offset="5594572">From the very inception of this case, Pugach was the prime -- suspect and he knew it if from no other source the widespread newspaper accounts of this heinous crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.578" offset="5681716">About four months later, after the police had completed their investigation, they placed under arrest on the same day at the same time, but at different places, the petitioner, the two men who had thrown the acid and one of them who had aided and abetted in the commission of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.169" offset="5812015">At the time that Pugach was apprehended, he had concealed upon his person a loaded firearm for which he had no license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.185" offset="5884113">The grand jury of Bronx County indicted Pugach and his three confederates for the crime of maim -- maiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.842" offset="5934791">Under another indictment against Pugach individually, they charged him with a violation of 1897 of the Penal Law, carrying a concealed weapon, which is a felony in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.415" offset="6009083">The indictment for the maiming was first moved for trial and it was set down to proceed on January 7th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.854" offset="6070836">About a week before it was to start, the present action was brought by petitioner in the United States District Court for the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.473" offset="6133217">Together with his complainant, petitioner served papers on a motion for an injunction pendente lite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.631" offset="6189850">The respondents cross-moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action was not maintainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.689" offset="6250141">Judge Bryant who had the motion, denied the temporary injunction and he granted the cross-motion and judgment was rendered accordingly and appeal was taken and both that order and judgment were affirmed at the Circuit Court or by the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.829" offset="6350660">Now petitioner in his brief tells this Court that the respondents do not deny that they intercepted telephone conversations on -- on his office telephone, that they do not deny that they introduced that evidence before the grand jury of Bronx County as a result of which two -- the two indictments were lodged against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.593" offset="6501752">The petitioner further tells this Court that the District Attorney does not deny that he intends to use this wiretap evidence at the trial of the two indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.494" offset="6581373">Petitioner does not claim to a single fact in the record, which in any way supports those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.692" offset="6630170">He merely says that in the opinions of Judges Medina and Chief Judge Lumbard that is the way they stated the facts, that the District Attorney did not make the -- a denial of the petitioner's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.801" offset="6722539">Now respondents respectfully maintain that to save that the District Attorney did not deny the petitioner's claims, as though we were admitting them, is grossly unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.433" offset="6797145">This petitioner knows that at the outset of the action, our cross-motion to dismiss the complaint was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.760" offset="6846464">As a consequence, there was no need to take issue with any of the claims asserted by petitioner in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.484" offset="6889305">No answer is good enough for a complaint that is legally insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.902" offset="6934967">I think it is a well-established principle that in order to secure an injunction, you must show that you have a clear legal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.791" offset="6994526">Now that could be demonstrated either by the allegations of a complaint or by extrinsic evidence contained in affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.371" offset="7032874">We say that there is no attempt at compliance with these prerequisites in the papers before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.031" offset="7087522">There are only two allegations that are worthy of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.243" offset="7116361">One, petitioner alleges that the District Attorney into those wiretap evidence before the grand jury, as result of which the two indictments were lodged against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.711" offset="7186265">The other allegation is upon information and belief that the District Attorney intends to introduce wiretap evidence, not contends with to, but intends to use wiretap evidence at the trial of those two indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.296" offset="7292531">We say that the claim that the District Attorney introduced wiretap evidence before the grand jury is obviously based upon conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.299" offset="7352613">Grand jury testimony is secret and can only be divulged by an order of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.344" offset="7388766">This petitioner does not claim that he ever inspected the grand jury minutes, as a consequence when he tells you that such evidence was presented before the grand jury, he's merely guessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.539" offset="7449579">He hasn't the slightest idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.262" offset="7460446">So far as the other allegation that I mentioned that petitioner believes that the District Attorney intends to introduce, intends to use wiretap evidence, we say that that is not entitled to any consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.877" offset="7542888">How could the respondents deny what the petitioner believes unless he sets forth the facts upon which that belief is based?</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.839" offset="7622719">What did the District Attorney ever say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.103" offset="7639751">What did the District Attorney ever do to justify that claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.858" offset="7666813">And to justify it, the temporary injunctions which have been granted by the federal court, I meant the Circuit Court and which are still in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.286" offset="7724492">Those injunctions restrained the District Attorney or respondents whereof introducing any wiretap evidence at the trial of either of those two indictments and while the first conjunction was in effect, the District Attorney proceeded with the trial of the indictment charging the defendant with carrying a loaded firearm in violation of the penal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.245" offset="7876315">The jury found the defendant guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.551" offset="7897527">On page 15 of my brief, I have set forth a resume of the undisputed, the unchallenged evidence at that trial as to the manner in which the police secured their information leading to at least upon which that indictment was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.500" offset="8029393">I think that when you read those facts, you will see that the defendant was not very candid with the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.380" offset="8076936">I believe too that you will be convinced that the claim of wiretapping in relation to that particular indictment is not just devoid of merit, but it is simply ludicrous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.413" offset="9269060">It doesn't -- that doesn't tell us anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.273" offset="9284420">He might just well have said – it was revealed to the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.065" offset="9315662">Now petitioner contends that it's definitely in my argument as I think circumscribed on the Stefanelli case, because that's our point one, he says that Stefanelli is distinguishable in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.102" offset="9387760">One of them is in a rather vague fashion, that he suggests that under a new concept of ordered liberty which has its core in the Fourth Amendment in Foston against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment, he had a basic right of privacy in a -- telephonic communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.283" offset="9500505">That's his theory and he then proceeds in his argument to tie that fundamental right in with Section 605.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.281" offset="9560482">Well, if he has a fundamental right of privacy in a telephone conversation, which we certainly concede, he didn't get that right from Congress under Section 605.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.452" offset="9621191">That was that the visions of 605 would not be applicable to a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.758" offset="9650448">Moreover, if he had a fundamental right, since he concedes that the so-called intrusion by the police was by order of the state court, then it would not have been an illegal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.814" offset="9726621">It would be exactly -- it would be a lawful search and he'd have no claim, but even if it were an illegal search, the situation would be identical to that which you had in the Stefanelli case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.228" offset="9796315">His other claim is that this differs from Stefanelli because the state affirmatively sanctioned the wrongful intrusion by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.006" offset="9863398">Now for that argument, he relies upon the statements and the opinion of Judge Medina that is on the -- granting the temporary injunction and upon -- and upon the dissenting opinion of Judge Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.132" offset="9935914">Now the gist of their thoughts, that is the thoughts expressed by those judges, is that the -- the visions of New York's Constitution and the statutes dealing with wiretaps, no, wiretapping, the granting of orders under a constitutional provision and legislation and the introduction of wiretap evidence at a trial with as they say, the full knowledge on the part of prosecutor that that is -- that a -- is a direct violation of Section 605 and a criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.719" offset="10134235">They seem to think that that is a part and parcel of an overall scheme on the part of New York to defy the supreme law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.938" offset="10195153">Now, I think that the indictment against the public officials of New York in that respect is not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.953" offset="10239143">Before this case came along, it had always been my view that it was not unlawful to introduce wiretap evidence at a trial of an indictment in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.791" offset="10310510">I -- I didn't pick that idea out of the thin air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.652" offset="10322004">I think it was the general view in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.713" offset="11886216">He said, the District Courts would be flooded with suits for injunctions against the use of wiretap evidence and its alleged fruits in the state courts with the consequence necessity of determining just what evidence was proposed to be introduced and whether the trial had reached such a stage that vindication of the federal right should be subordinated to practical considerations of state law enforcement and all these determinations would be subject to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.476" offset="12049324">Now, I don't think that Chief Judge Lumbard was exaggerating when he said that the federal courts would be flooded with litigation if these suits were permitted to be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.786" offset="12122467">In the City of New York, I would say that there are at least -- at least 75 judges who exercise criminal jurisdiction exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.297" offset="12180564">There are other judges such as Supreme Court Justices, who have a general jurisdiction, but the criminal branch on the Supreme Court is really activated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.878" offset="12238869">You have also judges of the -- of the domestic relations court that have limited criminal jurisdiction, but you at least have the -- at least 75 judges in the city courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.103" offset="12303757">Now, I think that the most damaging blow which would result, by allowing the accused in a state action -- in a state action to examine the place of prosecutors and witnesses to determine what evidence was proposed to be introduced and how the evidence was procured, would be a fatal blow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.279" offset="12416502">Now, how -- how aware the police secured their information is highly confidential, if we were required to disclose that source of information to an accused at a state trial in the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.081" offset="12615659">This Court and the federal courts generally, have had occasion to interpret Section 605 on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.187" offset="12644080">I cannot find a single case where any federal court or this Court, predicated an interpretation of Section 605 upon constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.733" offset="12682324">It is therefore patent that we're dealing here with the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.934" offset="12699146">We are not dealing with any constitutional prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.178" offset="12716074">The position of the respondents in this case is that the New York statute and Constitution does not contravene Section 605.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.669" offset="12770095">The issue in this case however, transcends the question of wiretap in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.587" offset="12797680">It goes somewhat further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.664" offset="12806040">The issue is further raised as to whether or not the federal courts shall enjoin the State of New York as to the introduction of -- of evidence in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.700" offset="12850134">In other words, shall a federal judge sit side by side in the state courts now and rule upon evidence and should this precedent be established when Stefanelli v. Minard clearly indicate it should not be, then why limit it to Section 605 situations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.416" offset="12921083">It could certainly be invoked in any situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.006" offset="12935398">The improper empanelling of a jury, the systematic exclusion of a particular race in a jury, the trial atmosphere, coerced confessions, the Justices of this Court of course, are familiar with it -- with the opinion, it's definitely against Minard and I just raised that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.386" offset="14332949">It prohibits not only the tapped conversation on the telephone, but prohibits eavesdropping generally and makes it a felony to violate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.895" offset="14366908">It is -- the requirements of the State of New York, are that a Supreme Court Justice after a hearing, issue a warrant before any wiretap order can be granted and that is the position in which we would have this Court view the statutory scheme in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.458" offset="14437230">We are not talking about an illegal wiretap in the sense of some irresponsible individual just riding roughshod over the rights of an individual as the petitioner led this Court to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.730" offset="14490311">This was as he acknowledges, a -- a legal wiretap under the laws of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.933" offset="14523120">Appended to with the brief of the amicus curiae, the District Attorneys Association, there are a number of remarks by District Attorney Silver and other people, clearly indicating that the New York statutory scheme has not resulted in flagrant abuses or -- or numerous wiretap orders that there has been great restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.598" offset="14609742">And that as a matter of fact, it would be impossible or at least very difficult to prosecute certain types of crime, without this benefit for law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.335" offset="14648717">We recognize that there is a concomitant detriment to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.921" offset="14667107">That is true undoubtedly, in -- in search and seizure, lawful search and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.556" offset="14685602">No doubt that a criminal would much prefer that search and seizure not be permitted, but by court warrant, it is permitted by a -- a lawful warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.511" offset="14725413">Similarly in the wiretap situation, the New York statutory scheme permits a wiretap under strict safeguards and makes it a felony for any individual without a lawful warrant, to tap wires.</text>

            <text syncTime="4318.989" offset="17379349">Now, the petitioner here does not know, but that the District Attorney has the consent of one of the parties to that conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.903" offset="17414980">I don't say that we did, but assuming that we did, it would certainly be perfectly permissible even under the federal law to introduce that, the Rafton case and other cases, yet on the assumption that wiretap evidence might be used, he goes into a federal court and the federal court says that you are enjoined from using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.339" offset="17504737">And then by some Pickwickian reasoning, they say, but you can go right ahead with your trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.473" offset="17533262">Now, the people of the State of New York feel that they must reserve the right to use whatever evidence the courts of the State of New York will deem legally admissible and how can we prognosticate for the future?</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.708" offset="17590209">What the exigencies of a particular trial will demand?</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.230" offset="17604315">What evidence might become available perhaps for the purposes of impeachment of a particular witness?</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.304" offset="17632632">And yet by enjoining it in blank, we could not even use wiretap legally obtained with the consent of the sender perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.036" offset="17667532">And that is another dilemma that is faced here by the injunction question and the -- the respondents most respectfully are this Court that since that is the specific issue before this Court, the injunction issue because after all that is the particular matter that was before the District Court that certainly it should not go as far as the petitioner says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.659" offset="17765961">And the respondents would urge this Court to reconsider Benanti in the light of the legislative history of Section 605, which when it was passed, not a word was said about what was intended to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.855" offset="17822804">And the appendix of the amicus indicates that Senator McLaughlin and Congressman Cellar, before this Court announced its decision in Benanti, both were under the firm conviction that the federal law did not prevent the use of wiretapping in the State of New York.</text>
