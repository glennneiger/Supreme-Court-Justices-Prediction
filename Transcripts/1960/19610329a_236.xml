            <text syncTime="21.598" offset="190757">We have a situation here arising in Cuyahoga County, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.082" offset="232761">The defendant-appellant in this case was living in a residential neighborhood, owned her own home, and living there in a two-family house on the second floor, having rented the first floor to another tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.361" offset="337878">She lived there with a daughter approximately eleven years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.689" offset="371106">The evidence in this case disclosed that she is a woman without any record whatsoever from the criminal point of view, a decent, respectable American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.328" offset="457728">One day these police officers of the City of Cleveland, three in number, and the record sets forth the occurrence, came to the house and wanted to be admitted for the purpose of making a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.272" offset="537454">When they rapped at the door or rang the bell, she looked out the window and asked them what they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.242" offset="565352">And they said that they wanted to search the house.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.145" offset="604954">Weekday, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.282" offset="613522">And she said that she would call her lawyer and see what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.903" offset="660020">Now, the evidence discloses that the police officers claimed that they were informed that there was some paraphernalia for the numbers game in the house, and they were also informed that a person wanted for questioning in a bombing was in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.591" offset="766809">She called her lawyer, Mr. Greene, who is my associate; and he said to her, if they have a search warrant, you permit them into the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.816" offset="815710">So she told them that they'd have to have a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.563" offset="834623">One of the police officers then called his chief, a Lieutenant Cooney, and told him he couldn't get into the house because they required a search warrant and within a few minutes thereafter, several zone cars with many police officers surrounded the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.703" offset="931171">Then, the evidence discloses, at least two of the police officers who knew -- one was Sergeant Delau, knew what he was there for, but made no effort to procure a search warrant, neither one of them did, but they testified that a search warrant was procured by a Lieutenant White.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.120" offset="1032840">Now, they didn't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.611" offset="1038796">The evidence discloses that they were told that a search warrant had been procured.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.203" offset="1065232">When they came to the house with the search warrant and by the time or supposed search warrant, by the time they arrived, Mr. Greene was also there.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. L. Kearns</label>
            <text syncTime="253.244" offset="1117372">There was no search warrant, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.269" offset="1129493">I intend to go to that from the evidence as we proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.388" offset="1157914">This Lieutenant White came and showed a piece of paper, and Mrs. Mapp demanded to see the paper and to read it to see what it was, which they refused to do, so she grabbed it out of his hand to look at it and then a scuffle started, and she put this piece of paper into her bosom and very readily the police officer put his hands into her bosom and removed the paper, and thereafter, thereafter handcuffed her while the police officers started to search the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.186" offset="1333144">Now, the evidence in the case discloses that the State claims there were only seven police officers, some in uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.615" offset="1366894">Mr. Greene, who was there and was not permitted entrance to the house, but who was kept outside, says there were approximately twelve police officers in all.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.544" offset="1418616">Now, the evidence discloses that no search warrant existed, although they claimed that there was a search warrant, there is absolutely no evidence of any magistrate that had been asked for a search warrant, there was no record of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.966" offset="1492281">We asked during the trial of the case that the search warrant be produced and it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.941" offset="1516210">The fact of the matter is that our own Supreme Court found that it was very questionable as to whether there was a search warrant in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.343" offset="1597816">She doesn't know what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.992" offset="1604399">It was a piece of white paper, but the police officers never produced it, because, as a matter of fact, if it please Your Honors, I waited in the trial of the case for Lieutenant White, who was supposed to be the man who procured the search warrant, to take the stand so that at least I could cross examine him as to where, when and how he procured the search warrant and what the search warrant contained, but the State was clever enough not to put him on the stand and no other police officer knew anything about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.888" offset="2459961">The evidence, of course, was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.693" offset="2475217">They claimed, the police officers claimed that they found some of this literature, a book or two, in the dresser drawer of her bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.221" offset="2525268">They found some literature, they claimed, in the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.346" offset="2557764">We say that she had a roomer in the house, a man by the name of Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.612" offset="2590887">He had occupied that room.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.704" offset="2603217">He had moved and left and she had corroborating testimony to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.558" offset="2630593">He had moved and left, and left some of his clothes and these things, including a .22 caliber revolver, in the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.835" offset="2671762">And when she discovered that he wasn't coming back within the week or two weeks, not knowing whether he was going to return or not, she started cleaning out the room in order to put his things away should he call for them or send for them, because his room rent was paid to the balance, to the end of the month and she wanted to clean the room out so that she could give the room to her daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.653" offset="2790985">And the situation was that while she was cleaning this room she found these things, a couple of books and so on, together with some of his belongings in the dresser drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.066" offset="2844693">Her testimony, and the testimony of her corroborating witness, was that they took these things out of the drawer.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.053" offset="2880637">And these particular books, the obscene literature was in a brown envelope, a paper bag—and that when they took these things out they saw what it was, and she said to the girl that was helping her, look at what terrible things men read, let's put it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.755" offset="2967468">So that they took these things and put it in a brown box, a small brown box together with his socks and a hat and things of that sort, and put it in the basement, but the police officers deny that they found these things in the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.743" offset="3035387">They said they found them all in the room and as a matter of fact the evidence shows, and the record is here, that they even denied that there was a pistol there, then later the other police officer says, yes there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.094" offset="3088781">So they didn't agree on their testimony at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.373" offset="3105917">However, she did explain to them and Sergeant, Mr. Haney who was the first witness, denied that she said that these things belonged to a roomer that formerly had had this room.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.611" offset="3170806">Whereas Sergeant Delau, and the record so shows, testified that she did tell him that, and that she was keeping these things for the man when he came for his goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.011" offset="3232455">Then following that, of course, she was charged and she was tried before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.859" offset="3267877">Now, the question came up in the trial of this cause, and this being a comparatively new statute in Ohio, the statute in itself merely says, "Whoever knowingly has in his possession," and goes on to say, "pornographic literature, even stories of crime, is guilty under this statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="829.695" offset="3423148">Now, the purpose, the reason for having it in the possession, as one of the judges of our own Supreme Court asked, what do you say we have it here and I said you're guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.830" offset="3483752">No question about it because the statute does not differentiate for any purpose of having anything in your possession, knowingly having in your possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.767" offset="3543416">And the court charged the jury that under the statute she knew it was there, and knowing that it was there, she had it knowingly in her possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.919" offset="3588033">Consequently, he practically charged that she was guilty and his charge so showed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2415.539" offset="9766515">As we see it, the central issue in considering the validity of this statute is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.109" offset="9792846">Is this an area in which the individual has the right to be let alone, to be free of governmental restraint?</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.710" offset="9827224">Mr. Justice Brandeis, dissenting in Olmstead versus the United States has stated it better than I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.394" offset="9857944">It is cited at page 16 of our brief amicus and he said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.535" offset="9882499">“The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.188" offset="9901098">They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.603" offset="9922832">They conferred, as against the government, the right to be let alone, the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.724" offset="9967344">More specifically, however, the issue is, does this statute constitute an invalid exercise of the State's police power so as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.836" offset="10019694">Now, we do not deny that a state may properly legislate in the area of morals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.166" offset="10045085">Nor do we argue at this time, although well at an earlier time we might have, after the decision in Roth versus the United States, that obscene utterances, the obscene word, the printed word, are within the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments as they relate to free speech and the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.331" offset="10133692">In passing and in candor, the American Civil Liberties Union adheres to the proposition that all forms of expression may be limited only by the application of the tests arising under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the test of clear and present danger, or, as modified in Dennis, clear and proper danger.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.851" offset="10539844">Our other branch of our argument is that we feel that, even in the area of morals, which we have conceded is a proper legislative area, that, as in other permissible legislative areas, such enactments or statutes must be reasonably adapted to accomplish the legislative purpose and must not be arbitrary and excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.997" offset="10636392">Furthermore, they must not infringe upon paramount individual rights, particularly where a similar legislative result may be achieved by other less drastic means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.360" offset="10685816">We submit that interposing a policeman between a normal adult and his library is not a proper means of accomplishing what might otherwise be a valid legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.365" offset="10729806">We contend that the statute is arbitrary and excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.988" offset="10740360">We urge that there are important individual rights which are protected against encroachment by the states by the concept of ordered liberty embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment, and which are substantially and unnecessarily limited by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.014" offset="10800441">And we say that the evil sought to be controlled here can be met by less drastic statutory means without limiting the liberties of the citizens of the State of Ohio and as a consequence we say that the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.180" offset="10853104">Now, our brief has discussed some of the sociological and scientific studies at page 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.173" offset="10889049">In Appendices A and B we have correlated some of the studies which have dealt with the question of whether obscene material results in depravity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.997" offset="10940353">We note that, at page 8, the conclusion seems to be that there is no positive study that so holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.654" offset="10970969">We are not saying that this is a necessary consideration to the matter of the First Amendment, clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.941" offset="11000121">That is not our point, but we are trying to demonstrate that this legislation is not reasonably related to, nor adapted to the accomplishment of any legitimate governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.933" offset="11056128">Why must the relationship be shown between the legislative means and the desired result more clearly in this kind of a case and it seems to us that it is because individual rights, such as the right of privacy, the right to read, which has been substantiated as part of the Fourteenth Amendment in Wolf versus Colorado and Butler versus Michigan, both of which opinions were written for the Court by Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.309" offset="11177650">And we do not feel it necessary to consider whether the Fourth Amendment is incorporated bodily into the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.721" offset="11207325">We think that certainly the right of privacy is a basic concept of freedom which appears there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.772" offset="11231462">We think also that Smith versus California gives an indication of the direction in which this Court may go in this case, and that is that even though the First Amendment is not involved in a matter dealing with admittedly obscene material, we think that this statute certainly has a potentially inhibiting effect upon freedom of expression, even if the material itself is not constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.029" offset="11336474">And we feel that the evil sought to be controlled here can be dealt with by means that don't infringe upon individual freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.442" offset="11358208">We think that there are other ways of attacking the problem of obscenity without saying to a person, “you cannot have in your possession a book which may or may not be obscene, which you do not know is obscene until you read it, and immediately after you have read it and have the necessary knowledge, whatever that may be, and that's a question which is left for another day too, as soon as you have the requisite knowledge, you are guilty of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.487" offset="11454339">We think that this is certainly a broadly drawn statute which is not necessary to achieve this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.168" offset="11485059">We urge the Court to keep in mind its own admonition in Roth, in which you will recall Mr. Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court, said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.477" offset="11554335">“The door barring Federal and state intrusion into this area cannot be left ajar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.509" offset="11570427">It must be kept tightly closed and opened only to the slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important interests.”</text>

            <text syncTime="6371.788" offset="25591599">In other words, if she had been searched on the street and all this obscene material was found, the constitutional provision against unreasonable search and seizure also goes to the person as well as the home and the fact that it was found in her home without a search warrant or a proper one, and on that issue, I want to correct something that I just remember Mr. Kearns told you, that the prosecutor promised on the trial of this case that she produce a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6408.925" offset="25740079">That isn't so at all, and it's not even in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="6432.130" offset="25832866">And that is why, on the authority, in fact, in view of the Lindway decision, that's why the court overruled the motion to suppress the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="6518.362" offset="26177891">To answer the question that was asked pertaining to our Supreme Court's ruling, on page 13 of our brief, our Supreme Court has said, “Under our statute as now worded, mere possession is forbidden even where the possessor does not have a purpose of again looking at the books or pictures; and, in the instant case, the jury could have found the defendant guilty and she could have been, as she was, sentenced as a felon, even though it believed her evidence that she had innocently acquired possession of these articles, had no intention of ever looking at them again and was merely keeping them pending instructions for their disposition from their owner and then they cite cases from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.588" offset="26418740">Now, the charge of the court to the jury, that portion of it is found on page 65 of our record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6588.410" offset="26458028">Number three; that the defendant had in her possession and under her control the books, pictures and photographs mentioned in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6601.300" offset="26509646">'Possession' means the act or state of detaining a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.076" offset="26536709">It is the act of holding or keeping it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.795" offset="26551547">Now, such detention does not mean that it is necessary always to have in one's sight the thing possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6622.803" offset="26595641">For example, one who deposits articles in a place of concealment may still be deemed to have them in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.326" offset="26637751">To have something under one's control is to have the present right and power to do with it as one wills.</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.130" offset="26676935">So that the court actually told the jury that under the language of this statute the defendant in this cause was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6654.623" offset="26722910">Now, a question arises as to what should she have done with these things after she discovered that they were improper things to have in her possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="6671.115" offset="26788843">Now, our statute, Section 2909.01, reads as follows --</text>

            <text syncTime="6702.083" offset="26912768">Now, we have Section 2909.01 of the Ohio statute which reads as follows, "No person shall maliciously destroy or injure property not his own.</text>

            <text syncTime="6772.091" offset="27192801">I want to just say a word or two in the language of our judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="6781.627" offset="27230939">Now, in the opinion of Judge's Taft, Bell, Herbert and Peck, the portion of Section 2905.34, Revised Code upon which defendant's conviction was based, now this is the majority opinion, is constitutionally invalid and for that reason, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6809.002" offset="27340445">However, Section 2 of Article IV of the Constitution of Ohio reads in part, “No law shall be held unconstitutional and void by the Supreme Court without the concurrence of at least all, but one of the judges except in the affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, declaring a law unconstitutional and void.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.742" offset="27459354">Now, I just want to say a word about the reading from the dissenting opinion of our Judge Herbert of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.350" offset="27521839">And he says, although I concur in paragraphs one and three of the syllabus, I must dissent from paragraph 2 which follows State versus Lindway, 131 Ohio State, page 166 and the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6875.039" offset="27604595">The facts are sufficiently stated in the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.634" offset="27622881">Section 14 Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides the right of the people to be secured on their persons, houses, papers and possessions against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation particularly describing the place to be searched and the person and things to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6912.777" offset="27755478">The judgment in the Lindway case is not in conflict with this constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6918.550" offset="27778570">Had I been a member of this Court at that time, I would have joined in the judgment as all the members of the Court tended because the evidence there clearly established that the defendant was operating a bomb manufacturing shop in the basement of that house.</text>
            <text syncTime="6937.498" offset="27854430">As stated by Judge Jones in the concurring opinion in that case.</text>
