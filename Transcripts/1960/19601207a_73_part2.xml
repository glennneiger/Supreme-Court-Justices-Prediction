            <text syncTime="148.981" offset="699329">Now, there is a possible distinction along this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.162" offset="716048">If we approach the Sherman Act question from the point of view of what has this done to competition?</text>
            <text syncTime="159.838" offset="742693">We might well say that the International Garment Workers' case is a situation of waging competition, that the improvement of the conditions of labor is important to competition because its labor who buys the products.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.937" offset="1055117">I'd like to make only two brief remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.358" offset="1068805">Mr. Ross's closing remark was that the complaint does not allege and effect on anyone but the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.318" offset="1092629">The complaint does allege that this conspiracy has prevented everyone who does not get the AGA seal of approval from competing in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.730" offset="1134320">Now, what I think he has overlooked is the potential effect of a power similar to the power that the AGA has.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.243" offset="1168384">In other words, they don't have to say, “We won't approve it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="269.657" offset="1181968">No one is going to come into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.779" offset="1190536">No one is going to invest the capital and time.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.752" offset="1202343">If they know that their competitors can say after their product is ready to be marketed, sorry you can't market -- market it.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.053" offset="1235571">Now, the second point was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.695" offset="1242154">In response to a question by the Chief Justice, Mr. Lamb said, “I believe that the present standards of the AGA do not restrict gas burners to metal that it was possible for a ceramic burner to be approved.”</text>

            <text syncTime="305.865" offset="1326791">On page 5, Mr. Lamb says, “AGA standards require that metal be used.”</text>
