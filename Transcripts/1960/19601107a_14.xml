            <text syncTime="813.484" offset="3357341">They held that Act 115 was unconstitutional and that they declared that the -- this man could not be fired because of his membership in the NAACP.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.951" offset="3399137">Now, subsequent to that decision, the appellant continued to refuse to file the affidavit required by Act 10 and he was notified by the school board that because of his refusal that he was not to be employed for the 1959, 1960 school term.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.434" offset="3477086">So that he was in fact, fired because of his refusal to sign the -- to fill out the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.707" offset="3510209">Now, we think that the statute is unconstitutional, Act 10, without regard to the first issue that I was raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.289" offset="3552528">That is taking it -- viewing the statute as if it were not passed at the second extraordinary session as mere -- as if it had no import at all with respect to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.622" offset="3605817">We think that the statute is bad, because of the fact that the statute, it seems to us, fails to meet what we regard or what we feel are the yardsticks that this Court has laid down for upholding and validating the statutes of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.435" offset="3689096">As far as those yardsticks are concerned, we think that there are three.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.145" offset="3707904">And they are that there must be the statute, if the statute impinges on freedom of speech, that the statute, there must be some compelling justification for it which must be demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.760" offset="3750431">We think that there's nothing in the history of this legislation or in the record here to show that there was any great need for this statute, any justification for it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.020" offset="3803408">The second requirement we believe, is that the statute, if there is an equal statute, that there must be some rational connection between what the statute seeks to achieve and the restriction which is imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.249" offset="3860355">Now, we don't believe that there is any connection between assisting in the administration of financing of schools and benefiting schools and the problems caused -- raised by the school segregation cases, any connections between that and the restriction on freedom -- on the freedom of association of the public school teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.071" offset="3947708">And even if those measures are met, we think that the statute has failed to meet a third yardstick, which this Court has imposed, and that is that if an impingement on speech is validated, the statute, which validates, must be in such terms that it cannot be utilized to restrict Constitution -- the Constitution exercise of each and other area.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.490" offset="4057318">In other words, what we've tried to use, we've used the language of the Court that was used in sometime ago and has not been, as far as we know, used in subsequent recent cases, but the idea was that the statute has to be narrowly drawn and confines of the specific regulation, the specific restriction which is allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.443" offset="4133177">Now, we think that on all of these measures, the statute must fall, because what we feel to be the policy of the reason of the court below, is that the court below says that these teachers association, teachers habits, and so forth are relevant to determine the fitness in the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.762" offset="4234428">We think, of course, that the school -- the school authorities have the right to investigate the teacher to determine fitness, etcetera. But what we think that the school authorities cannot do is, in order to attempt to do that to restrict the freedom of association of the teacher entirely on the ground that by in this way, they may uncover some evidence which is relevant to fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.267" offset="4332440">We think that they are required to make a decision and a declaration as to what association they regard as being relevant to the issue of teacher fitness which they are seeking to do something about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.316" offset="4384684">Spell that out, require the teacher to list those associations, if they are, and then at that point, the statute comes here to be measured -- to be measured by the yardsticks of this Court as to whether, in fact, the associations which had been listed or had been required to be listed are relevant to the issue of fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.440" offset="4465142">Now, we think that the reliance on Garner versus the Los Angeles Board and the reliance on the Lerner case and the Beilan case and Adler case on this place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.081" offset="4523656">In the first place, this is not an issue of subversion here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.849" offset="4550719">We also believed that -- and because of that, we don't think that they can be in reliance on that and we think that the language in those cases has to be related to the issue of what the Court had in mind or what the Court slurs the State was attempting to do, was that there was some correlation between the question of fitness and the subversion or inquiry about subversion, which the school authorities were attesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.773" offset="4654477">We don't have that problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.086" offset="4659702">That problem is not at all involved in this case in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.082" offset="4683734">The other thing is that the argument is made by -- in the appellees' brief that this is -- this statute is not bad because after all, the teacher is not required to be fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.004" offset="4771401">In other words, it doesn't -- it burdens but it doesn't punish speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.939" offset="4791150">And we feel that this does not help support the regulation, because of the fact that this Court has held on many occasions from Thomas versus Collins through the cases such as the NAACP versus Alabama and Bates versus Little Rock, that the fact that the restriction does not punish, merely burden speech that this does not keep it from being a violation and infringement of freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.799" offset="4914552">So that the fact, as we admit, that the school authorities are not required, they are there told that you list this and actually and in the abstract, once the teacher is -- list these organizations and may well be, they argue, that she will not be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.209" offset="4996159">And maybe membership in the -- in the NAACP or membership in the Urban League or these other kinds of organizations will not require that the teacher be fired and this, of course, is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.422" offset="5041089">But the point is that the restriction which is bear imposed, we feel, imposes upon the teacher a burden of what this Court has described in Smith versus California as a self-censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.243" offset="5124368">And because the inevitable result, we think, is that the teacher being required to list these organizations whatever they are, the tendency is going to be for the teacher to, therefore, involve herself in and be concerned with an organizational activities, only the things that she or he regards as safe or the things that will meet with the approval of her superiors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.961" offset="5223215">Now, this is a kind of a loss of freedom, of a sense of freedom of the teacher, which we think would have or we have argued would have disastrous result on the question of academic freedom.</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.408" offset="9485040">Suppose the statute haven't been on the books or ceased to be on the books, asked just as a voluntary act on the part of teachers, if they wish of their own free will, to give a list of their associations, just like this, with no legislative compulsion, and some do and some don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.301" offset="9584619">At the year, suppose the educational authorities do not renew -- do not rehire, if I may use that term about teachers, reemploy teachers, and they do not reemploy all those who did not make these voluntary disclosures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.484" offset="9761311">Now, under the law of Arkansas, as I understand it, if those teachers are -- their contracts are not renewed without any reason, then the teacher would have no redress except, it seems to me, that the due process question would arise if the teachers can show that their failure to renew was based upon their refusal to issue -- I mean to sign this affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.080" offset="9875728">Then, I think no matter what the law of Arkansas is that this would -- this case would at least come here as a federal due process question which would have to be determined on the basis of decisions of this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herschel H. Friday Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2649.579" offset="10701720">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.476" offset="10729305">I represent the Little Rock Special School District, the board of directors thereof, and the superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.203" offset="10764204">We were parties to this proceeding because Mr. Shelton, the plaintiff, was an employee of the Little Rock School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.434" offset="10797119">He had been an employee for 25 years prior to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.595" offset="10813733">As Mr. Carter has accurately stated, there is nothing in the record to indicate any disqualification on his part by virtue of incompetency or any other reason than the fact that Mr. Shelton refused to file the affidavit required by Act 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.545" offset="10893563">The School District, under those circumstances, later after the conclusion of the trial, stipulated so there would be no question in this record that due to his failure, his contract was not renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.150" offset="10955943">That stipulation came in later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.210" offset="10964198">It was made necessary here because of the proceedings that developed and so that there would be no question and we had no disposition to let the matter go off on any -- a procedural point one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.448" offset="11025115">Little Rock School District takes no issue with reference to the wisdom of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.365" offset="11048835">We do not think the wisdom of it, one way or the other, is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.697" offset="11062209">I believe Mr. Carter stated here, there had been no showing in justification for the Act of any necessity for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.842" offset="11090735">Certainly, the record was not developed in that particular but we would state our position that this is immaterial and is not properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.333" offset="11132740">There's no necessity for such a showing, if the legislature has acted properly within the scope of its power or jurisdiction, then it is not a question to challenge whether it -- the motives and what not that it acted on it or the wisdom that it used in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.973" offset="11207241">Now we would state the position of the School District in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.191" offset="11232110">I think I can state it fairly simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.555" offset="11245589">It may not turn out to be such a simple situation. Certainly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly are protected and have been so held by this Court by the First Amendment, which is read into the Fourteenth Amendment as certainly being of such a fundamental nature as being part of due process of the Fourteenth Amendment and therefore applicable as to state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.963" offset="11355199">Now, there is no question about that, the decisions leave no doubt that that's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.953" offset="11379231">I have a little trouble with it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.385" offset="11388949">The test seems to have been that the particular legislation that's challenged amounts to a substantial abridgement of these rights that are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.321" offset="11440671">We have pointed out that while these rights certainly exist, there are no sanctions in this Act, unlike the usual situation of the cases that come up when you get into subversive activities or disloyalty or what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.832" offset="11514650">This Act, if you list any number of organizations or if you list the Communist Party, the Act does not say that you're discharged for that reason, the Act simply says, "You will file the affidavit and give the information."</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.159" offset="11572015">Now, of course, the sanction is there that if the affidavit is not filed, then the school districts and those others under the Act, the institutions of higher learning, there are several incidentally in our Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.741" offset="11630320">The University of Arkansas is the largest with some 5,000 or 6,000 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.173" offset="11652054">There are several other state-supported colleges in the State of Arkansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.042" offset="12003558">I could give the Court my understanding of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.760" offset="12014425">I have substantially agreed with Mr. Carter's analysis that we have a statute in the State that provides that unless notice is given within a specified period at the time of this litigation, it provided, that in the event a teacher was under contract with a school district and notice was not given by the parties, one way or the other, within a 10-day period after that the particular school term, that contract was automatically renewed for one more year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.504" offset="12157367">So in that sense, if no notice was given, you had tenure for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.422" offset="12177011">Now, there are good many school districts, and I think, I am outside of the record on this but as a matter of information, I think, the University of Arkansas, which by regulation of the particular governing body, the board of trustees, there are in the case of my client, the board of directors of the school district, have given the teachers tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.143" offset="12263946">And we have specified conditions upon which a teacher maybe discharged, but we cannot of course, go contrary to a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.955" offset="12299160">School districts are creatures of the state law and if the state says, we must have an affidavit, of course, we have adhered to the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.938" offset="12331133">But if an affidavit was filed, then I think we would be bound by the tenure provisions that we read into our contracts and the information that maybe developed by the affidavit would -- could perhaps be used a little differently by different school districts depend on what -- depending upon what their particular regulations that they may put in their contracts may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.495" offset="12429354">Alright, but in general, aside from that, I think it takes nothing to discharge if you give the notice as required or after the one year carryover.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.870" offset="12614823">In addition, the school district gets state aid on the basis, or forgotten of figures, a little over half would come in from their own taxes and perhaps a little less than half would come in from state aid which is distributed on a minimum foundation and apportionment act of the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.625" offset="12717850">Now, as I stated, we do not challenge the proposition that under certain circumstances, the freedoms of assembly and of association and of joining any type of organization that a teacher might be required to list in this affidavit, we do not challenge the fact that they would fall within the First and therefore brought into the Fourteenth Amendment, under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.981" offset="12819310">Now, in the situation here, I am not sure that we hit that substantial abridgment of the freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.285" offset="12872495">Now, in the cases that the Court has considered, if we're talking about a private situation, which the facts of this case show, that is as to the parties, these affidavits were, under these facts, treated as confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.279" offset="12952534">Now, there is nothing in the law that makes them confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.189" offset="12964133">There is nothing in the law that makes them public records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.840" offset="12978761">And the Supreme Court of Arkansas, when it passed on the case, really left the question open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.503" offset="12997360">But they did point out that they could be treated as confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.865" offset="13010840">Now, as long as this, they are treated as confidential information, as long as we do not get into a situation, such as Alabama or Bates, whereby if we are concerned with NAACP membership, so that the mere public knowledge of that membership interferes substantially with the right of association, because it discourages one to associate, if they are going to be subjected to punishment by physical abuse or annoying phone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.949" offset="13123166">Now, we do not have that situation here on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.590" offset="13137690">We are not talking about anything as constituting a substantial, an abridgment of these rights as those -- as those cases are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.840" offset="13178755">Here, we have information furnished to a school board and the other case you will have, it's furnished to of course to a board of trustees of the University by policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.311" offset="13216580">They keep them confidential; no one knows about it, we feel is a proper inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.750" offset="13234343">So, I feel first on the balancing of the two considerations as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.401" offset="13252942">I'm not sure that we even have a substantial abridgment of these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.720" offset="13278229">Although, as if it had been in the cases where the Court has said that these are so important that we'll weigh this against the considerations of the State if the State has strong cogent reasons for acting in this field, even though they abridge them some, we'll weigh one against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.724" offset="13350222">Now, in the weighing process, I see nothing in these facts that gets it even in the category of those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="4604.943" offset="18523094">There -- there was an application for a stay that was denied, it was not pursued further, as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.853" offset="18558830">Alright, perhaps Mr. Carter can answer that more accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.407" offset="18573040">I had my recollection there was in this -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.449" offset="18605119">I would just touch briefly on the other points that we have in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.807" offset="18630614">There is the allegation here that the Act, if not bad for other reasons because it is too general, we do not feel it is too general, then it is bad on the basis of condemnation by association, I suppose there's a proper charge of words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.671" offset="18698010">Now, on the two general points, our position is that this is a proper area for state inquiry that the state legislature, in its wisdom which should not be tested or reviewed, determined that in the proper administration of the public schools, it would be helpful and school boards were directed in accordance with that determination to get this affidavit, to get a listing of the associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.061" offset="18811591">They were not told to discharge anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.516" offset="18821413">They were not told to take any particular action one way or the other with reference to the information that they got.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.269" offset="18844400">The facts show that the school boards involved in this case have treated it as confidential as other personnel information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.658" offset="18882017">There is no right to a public meeting or public records on information regarding personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.951" offset="18903228">Otherwise, our statute provides, you must have those meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.587" offset="18917752">We say that the State can properly ask this information that it is not too broad under the standards as set up by this Court, that there is no necessity to attempt to confine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.528" offset="18965504">Alright, therefore, we say for that reason, the right of the State in this appeal, under the facts of this case in testing this act as to whether it's constitutional on its face, at least, outweigh any abridgment that may exist of freedom of speech or freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.434" offset="19049096">Alright, now, further quite apart from that and if that would be the result, if this were a session of the legislature when there were no desegregation problems in the State, I think it is argued here that because it was passed at a special session of the Legislature of the State of Arkansas in 1958, when there were such problems, that by virtue of being part of a package, it is bad by association because it was one of the laws that were adopted by the legislature, which have been condemned and are being condemned here as attempts to, I believe the language is, defy the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.366" offset="19236864">Now, we state with reference to that that the allegations are not sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.062" offset="19259643">They are not sufficient grounds to condemn this Act, to hold it unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.941" offset="19287124">There is nothing in the base of the Act that makes it unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.245" offset="19304364">There is nothing in the facts that makes it unconstitutional as to its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.498" offset="19329337">We state that the motives of the legislature, the motives of the Governor of the State of Arkansas in his proclamation and in the speech that was introduced in this record to which we object it on the grounds that it was not proper or immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.350" offset="19396733">As this Court has held and as the State of Arkansas has held, the motives make not difference if the legislature is acting within the proper scope of its authority, we will not inquire as to why we did -- as to why it did these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.077" offset="19455666">Now, that basically is our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="4953.235" offset="19916361">We were brought into this case after the original action had been filed.

            <text syncTime="4970.642" offset="19985951">And so at that time, we did raise a question in the lower court as to whether or not, there was a justiciable issue or whether there was actually a case or controversy, but we were overruled there and did not pursue that in this appeal here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5090.021" offset="20463470">Now, with reference to the college, I might say that the restraining order was issued prior to the time that the contracts for the college were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.387" offset="20504952">Now, that wasn't true as far as Pine Bluff School District 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.092" offset="20515715">They had already gone through with their procedure of hiring and their contracts had been executed at the time the hearing in the lower court was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.063" offset="20551659">We submit, as far as our people are concerned, our clients in this case that we can't agree with the basic assumption that seems to run through the brief filed in here by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.470" offset="20613204">And that is that the school districts will not act properly with reference to the information which comes from these affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.369" offset="20652805">Now, as I suggested to you, the only thing that we have in the record as far as this case is concerned involving either Arkansas AM&amp;N College or Pine Bluff School District No. 3 is a fact that they were executed, the contracts were given out, and apparently, caused no great problem in connection with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.692" offset="20734098">So, I think that we cannot agree with the position taken by the appellants in this case that there will be an area of fear or they would be afraid to sign the affidavits, they can't continue to teach, and there would be a mass exodus from the systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.019" offset="20803480">That isn't true as far as the facts show in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.850" offset="20818735">I would have to say that that's conjecture or speculation and isn't bourne out by what we held before you in this particular case.</text>
