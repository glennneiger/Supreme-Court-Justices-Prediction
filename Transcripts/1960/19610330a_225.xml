            <label>Mr. Sidney M. Glazer</label>
            <text syncTime="29.437" offset="221080">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.081" offset="235708">This case is an appeal from a decision of the -- of Missouri Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.246" offset="268309">And it presents the questions of the -- literally of this Missouri scheme for dealing with the seizure of alleged obscene material raising the question whether the Missouri statutes, in allowing the seizure of alleged obscene material prior to any judicial determination, that the material is in fact obscene, whether or not that constitutes a violation of the freedom of speech and press clauses of the Federal Constitution and whether the application of the Missouri statutes by allowing police officers to go forth under a general warrant authorizing them to go to six distributors of publications and seize all obscene matter, and to describe as all obscene matter, whether that also is an unconstitutional violation of the freedom of speech and press clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.505" offset="601422">The other question presented is whether or not the publications condemned in this particular case or ever condemned by a constitutional test of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.895" offset="662967">Now, this Court has noted -- has postponed the jurisdictional question to the hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.582" offset="705703">And the first -- I shall first get into the statutory scheme and then the particular facts to this case and then discuss the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.865" offset="766830">The statutes involved, they are set forth on page 35 of appellants' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.744" offset="802356">Section 542.380 of the Missouri statutes provide that upon a complaint under oath by -- in writing an essence to a judge that certain scribed property is being kept that the judge, if he finds reasonable grounds, may issue a search warrant for the described property.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.604" offset="933804">And then, the Section further provides, at paragraph (1) that ceratin gambling paraphernalia might be seized, we're not concern with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.975" offset="971316">And in paragraph (2), which is set out on page 36, it provides that obscene articles which were kept for the purposes of sale distribution or circulation may be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.872" offset="1034846">Then in paragraph (3), another part, we're not concern with here, it deals with contraceptive devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.527" offset="1069432">In paragraph (4), which has an incidental bearing on the case, it -- it allows not only the seizure of say obscene material but any material used to manufacture say this -- any alleged obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.488" offset="1145292">The other provisions of the statutes provide that the warrant shall describe the articles to be seized and that the person from whom the article is seized shall have notice, that the officer who seizes the material shall retain in his possession until after a hearing and that the judge issuing a warrant shall hold a hearing to determine whether or not these items should be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.546" offset="1281546">Now, in addition -- now and then finally if, after a hearing, these items are found to be obscene, their destruction may be ordered or they may be held for purposes of criminal prosecution and then the destruction ordered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="312.144" stopTime="315.643">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="312.144" offset="1351973">Under subparagraph (4), I suppose a printing press could be seized at the State.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sidney_m_glazer" startTime="315.643" stopTime="573.746">
            <label>Mr. Sidney M. Glazer</label>
            <text syncTime="315.643" offset="1365974">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.361" offset="1368795">I think that's broad enough to include a printing press if it was manufacturing alleged obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.263" offset="1408397">Now, in addition to the statutory scheme, the Missouri Supreme Court has promulgated rules under the Missouri Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.710" offset="1458239">It has that right providing the rules only deal works as procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.577" offset="1481644">Now, it has promulgated Rule 33, and it's -- which is set out on page 38 of the appellants' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.414" offset="1525008">Under this rule, it set -- it sets forth requirements of a complaint for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.599" offset="1557817">And it says that a -- such a complaint may issue if -- if there is, in certain premises, personal property, if -- whose seizure is authorized by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.816" offset="1630647">And it provides two conditions under which such a complaint may issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.364" offset="1648828">Number one, if the complaint is verified under oath and it states fact positively and not upon information and belief, the judge must issue a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.744" offset="1706297">However, if it states evidential facts, then the judge must find probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.804" offset="1738585">Now, in the -- in this particular case, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.392" offset="1764916">It goes back to 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.571" offset="1777664">And on October the 8th, 1957, a police officer went to the wholesale distributor, and he spoke to the wholesale distributor and apparently must have looked over what the wholesale distributor, what sort of magazines this distributor was -- was distributing this entire stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.392" offset="1856972">This distributor was the principle magazine distributor in -- in Greater Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.380" offset="1880900">Then on October the 9th, he went to the five retail newsstands involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.955" offset="1907231">And on each of the five newsstands, he purchased one magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.250" offset="1928338">Now, it so happens that there were -- he purchased actually three different magazines in all.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.788" offset="1966477">In other words, there were some duplications of -- of what he purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.927" offset="1983091">Then on the next day, he went and he filed a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.585" offset="2005661">And that complaint -- they are all alike, and it was stipulated that they are all alike except for differences in name, and that complaint is set out on page two of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.162" offset="2059995">Now, all that complaint states is that on October the 10th, 1957, the police officer, and -- he describes the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.644" offset="2117987">There is no argument about the description on the premises being alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.926" offset="2135124">That certain persons have kept, and this complaint goes -- follows the wording of the Missouri statute, Section 542.380, have kept for the purposes of selling, publishing, exhibiting and giving away obscene books, and then it goes -- follows the entire wording of the statute obscene, lewd, licentious, indecent and lascivious books.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.634" offset="2237942">That's all the complaint state -- stated and that was -- each of the six complaints were identical except they had different descriptions of the new -- of the newsstand and wholesale distributor to be searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.632" offset="2297919">But they all describe what was being possessed in the same general terms of obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.505" offset="2325400">Then, he presented this to the -- a trial judge in the Circuit Court of Jackson County.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.606" offset="2361762">The judge heard no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.309" offset="2368658">He presented no magazines to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.053" offset="2379630">All he presented to the judge were these complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.209" offset="2392168">So, the judge --</text>

            <text syncTime="600.399" offset="2505017">Now, whether they also distributed some types of newspapers, I do not know, and the record doesn't indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.928" offset="2527065">This is the major magazine distributor in Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.173" offset="2544097">Now, then, the judge, just acting on these complaints, issued the search warrant, which is set out on page three of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.049" offset="2583594">And this search warrant was directed not to the police officer, this is little wired thing, not to the police officer who even filed the complaint and who had visited the newsstand, that was directed to any peace officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.431" offset="2657050">And the -- the search warrant recites that whereas this complaint had been filed alleging that there are obscene material at these various places and there -- that -- and actually issued a separate search warrant for each place, that the -- and -- and whereas he found probable cause, therefore, he -- he commands any peace officer to execute the warrant by day or night.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.383" offset="2792887">It actually was executed in the daytime and to seize all -- all the obscene material at these various premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="6081.090" offset="24427708">But the appellants say that they have an absolute right and that that is all that Missouri can do.</text>

            <text syncTime="6117.385" offset="24572949">This Court has said the State is not limited to criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="6142.391" offset="24672946">Therefore, I believe that the statutes, considered as a whole, are not an unreasonable restraint upon the right of freedom of speech and of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.365" offset="24728848">And this Court has more than once held that the rights under freedom of speech and of the press are not absolute.</text>
