            <label>Ms. Anna R. Lavin</label>
            <text syncTime="12.400" offset="152952">Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.892" offset="166954">This action originated in the Northern District of Illinois as a suit brought under Section 360 of the Nationality Act of 1952 for a judgment declaring this petitioner who was born of a United States citizen mother and an alien father born abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.553" offset="241560">We're asking for the (Inaudible) judgment that he be -- be declared a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.045" offset="263502">The petitioner is now on the end of 55 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.048" offset="275519">He was conceived in the United States and he has resided continuously in the United States since his entry at the age of 3 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.068" offset="311672">He is one of six children born to his parents -- the one of six children born to his parents who was born outside the continental limits of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.380" offset="356916">His claim to citizenship rests on four alternative bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.031" offset="379486">The first is under Section 2172 of the revised statutes of 1874 which statutes were in effect at the date of his birth which provided that “Children of persons who are now or have been citizens of the United States are to be considered as citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="88.979" offset="459316">The petitioner's claim to citizenship in that regard urges that the words “children of persons” is to be considered in the distributive as well as in the collective and the words are now or has been, is not restricted to retrospective application but should in accordance with regular and accepted statutory construction be given prospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.517" offset="561403">The second basis concerns the interpretation of the Act of March 2, 1907 which provided for resumption of citizenship by an expatriated parent and the naturalization of his or her child by such resumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.202" offset="632142">This was enacted subsequent to petitioner's birth but it has by -- well, it has been judicially determined to be declaratory of the common law then in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.656" offset="681984">We urge that that statute is not to be given the interpretation of giving greater rights to a former expatriate or to a naturalized person than it does a native-born citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.565" offset="733602">And the status of the petitioner's mother, Mrs. Montana, on her return to the United States should not be treated as less than such an expatriate -- an -- a former expatriate or a naturalized parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.726" offset="786265">The third basis is similar to the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.367" offset="804864">It concerns the Act of May 24th, 1934 which also provided for the bestowing of citizenship on an alien-born child of a -- or a current born child of a United States citizen parent, or also upon naturalization of such a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.544" offset="881560">This statute again has been judicially interpreted as merely clarifying the uncertainties in the Act of -- of March 2, 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.322" offset="932655">This Act, however, spells out that the bestowal of citizenship may pass by -- through the citizenship of either the mother or the father whereas in the Act of 1907, it merely recited the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.471" offset="989288">The fourth basis is addressed to the equity powers of this Court and urges that the Government be not allowed to avail itself of the result of an erroneous instruction given by a consular official to the mother of the plaintiff, who was prior to the birth of the child and while awaiting his birth, a 15-year-old person.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.703" offset="1082180">The facts of this case are fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.080" offset="1103705">Madelyn Montana, the petitioner's mother was born in New Jersey in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.923" offset="1127111">She married Joe Montana in 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.471" offset="1149262">Joe, the father, had been born in Italy but he had for several years prior to the marriage resided in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.014" offset="1179460">Joe Montana and Madelyn Montana left the United States for Italy in 1905 -- no, January 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.492" offset="1217390">At that time, Madelyn was been about four months pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.548" offset="1237556">She arrived in Italy in February of 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.016" offset="1259395">By a month and a half after arriving, Madelyn went with her mother to the American Consulate to obtain a passport for her return home.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.629" offset="1297847">The American Consulate refused to issue one to her in her advanced state of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.538" offset="1321566">Mrs. Montana, the only witness at the trial -- trial testified that she -- he had said to her, “Lady, you cannot go in that condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.248" offset="1352391">Come back after you get your baby.”</text>
            <text syncTime="315.386" offset="1364929">She resided in Italy for -- with her mother until the birth of the plaintiff on June 26, 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.440" offset="1397112">Prior to that, however, in March or April of 1906, Joe Montana, the husband, the father of the petitioner, returned to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.472" offset="1437236">Again, Madelyn Montana, testifying, said that she didn't know where he was going, we were on the (Inaudible) at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.855" offset="1470777">After the plaintiff's birth, she returned to the American Consulate and there she obtained a passport for herself and for her child.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.391" offset="1508916">Mauro, Joe Montana and her mother, Mauro John Montana, his mother and the maternal grandmother, returned to the United States in September of 1906 where he was admitted as a United States citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.498" offset="1761364">They were never divorced.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.517" offset="1769409">The first basis on which we claim that Mauro John Montana is a citizen of the United States is under, as I said, the Act of -- the revised statutes of 1874, Section 2172 thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.674" offset="1830118">And it is our submission that the children or persons who are now or have been citizens shall before without -- with outside the jurisdiction and limits of the United States be considered citizens, imports birth any time during the existence of that statute when a United States citizen bore a child abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.980" offset="1911306">That interpretation provides for prospective application of the statute and it is in the Court with the strong legal presumption that statutes are meant to operate prospectively unless it is made clear and unequivocal that retrospective application is to be annexed to a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.618" offset="1993853">The Seventh Circuit, in the deciding this case in its opinion, expressly noticed that there was no such limiting language, but suggests that the Congress inadvertently overlooked limiting its operation to retrospective operation rather than the accepted prospective operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.885" offset="2074937">That is the -- actually the basis for the decision adverse to the petitioner on this point in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.661" offset="2110046">We suggest to this Court that the strong legal presumption directing prospective application should not be overcome by imputing inadvertence to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.892" offset="2162918">We also make the further suggestion that the words “are now or have been citizens” are not such strong, clear and imperative words using the language of the cases out of this Court as to reject the interpretation that they relate to a time contemporaneous with satisfaction of the provisions of the Act, that is sometime between 1874 and 1934 when a child of a United States citizen was born abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.183" offset="2284126">In our brief, we set forth -- forth at page a 10 series of cases where the word “now in statutes” has been so interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.862" offset="2318817">That is to a time contemporaneous with the satisfaction of the provisions of the Act and its -- in accordance with such approved interpretation that we submit that the word “now in the Act” speaks as of a time when a person in such as Mrs. Montana, who is a United States native-born citizen, has a child born abroad any time between 1874 and 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.279" offset="2540440">However, the -- the main source of resistance to the prospective application for which -- why -- which we urge upon this Court has its source of an article written by a man by the name of Horace Binney relating to the preceding Act of 1802.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.093" offset="2611702">The Act of 1802 was substantially the same as this Act of 1874 providing similarly children of persons who are now or have been citizens shall be born abroad be deemed citizens but added a proviso that in order for that Act to become operative, there was a requirement of United States residence by the fathers of such children.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.406" offset="2708982">That does not occur in the Act of -- in Section 2172.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.479" offset="2733328">Mr. Binney said that are now was -- spoke as of the date of enactment referring to the Act of 1802 and he said that was April 14, 1902 and that was when its benefit stopped and with that interpretation, he spoke of the said plaintiff foreign-born children of citizens and it, he writing in 1854, indicated that there had been no law to cover this people during that entire 15 to -- 52 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.511" offset="2857462">This Court -- this Court subsequently, in United States versus Wong Kim Ark and in Weedin versus Chin Bow at least passively accepted the interpretation put on that Act by Mr. Binney.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.276" offset="2928515">But I do want to point out that in both of these cases or shall I say neither of them, the specific point here was not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.709" offset="2966235">Further -- I would say further complicating the problem on retrospective whereas prospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.791" offset="3006568">The Congress in 1855 passed a law declaring children theretofore born or thereafter born outside the continental limits of fathers who were United States citizens were declared to be citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.284" offset="3132479">There was, however, no repeal of the Act of 1802 and the argument of the respondent in this case suggests inherently that this Act of 1855 was the repealer of the Act of 1802 and that the Act of 1855 applied exclusively to children of United States citizens born abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.198" offset="3228191">But unfortunately for that interpretation, Congress in 1874 substantially re-enacted the Act of 1802 as the Section 2172 under which we claim -- we -- which we make this claim of citizens -- citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.000" offset="4779342">That -- their urging of course found response in the Seventh Circuit decision which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.817" offset="4806614">And it -- it's our position and our urging upon this Court that that argument stands on several faulty bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.375" offset="4840887">First, it in -- in repeals 2172 and a statute simultaneously enacted and of course, the people statute and it compels the retrospective application of a re-enacted statute, contrary to every basic principle of a statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.346" offset="4924792">It also ignores the duty of the Commissioners to re-enact statutes general and permanent in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.205" offset="4964185">The argument seems to strain to divest in the face of the accepted law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.231" offset="4988322">It strains to divest citizenship when all facts in law are under the decisions of this Court be construed in favor of the claim for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.003" offset="5027401">The second phase of our argument with regard to Section 2172 brings us to the interpretation of children of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.985" offset="5091349">We submit that that is to include the distributive -- a child of a person as well as children of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.120" offset="5123845">Our principle reliance in that regard is found in the revised statutes themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.769" offset="5146415">Section 1 of the revised statute says that in determining the meaning of words -- the plural number may include the singular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.594" offset="5185703">The -- there is a further basis for our suggestion although I do think that in itself is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.825" offset="5234709">The further basis is that the next preceding clause, the first clause of 2172, we rely on the second, has been interpreted many times, many times to apply to the distributive that is a child of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.654" offset="5317987">The respondent's argument ignores the provisions of Section 1 allowing the interpretation as including the distributive and explains the cases themselves as meaning applying in the singular only when the -- one of the -- the alien parent is dead or is completely divorced from the citizen parent and the citizen parent has custody of the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.921" offset="6163101">It suggests itself in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.137" offset="6179924">At page 34, the Government has quoted Congressman Cutting who proposed the 1955 legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.921" offset="6223078">And Congressman Cutting said in the reign of Victoria in the year 1844, the English parliament provided that the children of English mothers, though married to foreigners, should have the rights and privileges of the English subjects, though born out of allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.538" offset="6285563">I have not, in this Bill, gone to that extent as the House will observe from the reading of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.519" offset="6401442">This reads rather unusually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.620" offset="6409801">It -- just prior to this Section to which he refers, it says that native-born British subjects shall be able to hold land, they shall be able to own personal property, they shall be able to hold certain offices very similar to the provisions that we have under our Constitution as the precedent who must be native born.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.511" offset="6597465">The consecutiveness of the Section would seem to appear that such a woman would be able to pass unto her child the rights of a native-born child including the right to hold the offices that a native-born child would have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.049" offset="6675519">And so he has not because in the re-enactment in 1874, you will find that 2172 under which we are now before this Court is listed under naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.068" offset="6731630">And 2172 says that those children will be deemed citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.812" offset="6750647">1993, the re-enactment of the Act of a 1855 is listed under citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.998" offset="14087398">Now, there's no testimony in this record that Mrs. Montana thought she needed a passport or that the consul told her that she needed a passport and there certainly couldn't be any showing that there was a requirement of a law of the United States that she had to have a passport to come back to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.781" offset="14170467">The fact is as this Court has said, and any research will show that in 1906, our laws did not have a requirement of any document for anybody whether he was citizen or an alien as a requirement for coming to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.434" offset="14245073">Now, we say that taking Mrs. Montana's testimony at its maximum, the most it amounts to is a statement that she went to the consul and he told her to come back some other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.192" offset="14304110">We think that there are other matters -- there is other testimony by her, by Mrs. Montana herself which cast doubt on this story of a fact that consul refused her a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.361" offset="14368789">For example, Mrs. Montana testified that she went with her parents to a little town and that the officials in this little town without any difficulty, without any hesitancy issued passports to her parents, that they told her to go to Naples for her own passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.881" offset="14454888">Now, if the officials in the little town which is not described had authority to issue passports to her parents, why didn't those officials have authority to issue the passport to Mrs. Montana?</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.888" offset="14510895">Why was it necessary to sent her to Naples where this alleged incident occurred?</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.052" offset="14535555">It is also said, it was argued by counsel today and was mentioned in the brief that this passport might have been a requirement under Italian law, it might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.710" offset="14578186">Is there any showing in the record of any such requirement?</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.123" offset="14623848">As a matter of fact, there is no showing that this passport was required for anything except the supposed convenience of Mrs. Montana, the wish to obtain a passport.</text>

            <text syncTime="4091.614" offset="16469870">At the time of Mr. Montana's birth in 1906, the controlling statute was R.S. 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.215" offset="16500276">That statute provided that any child heretofore or hereafter born being both prospective and retrospective, should become a citizen only if born to an American father, provided, the father had previously resided in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.286" offset="16572479">Now, petitioner obviously can claim no right under this statute, since his father was not a citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.707" offset="16602154">However, petitioner claims that under another section of the revised statutes, 2172, he got a right to citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.986" offset="16639352">2172 speaks of the children of persons who now are, or who have been citizens and confers the rights of citizenship on those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.736" offset="16686268">Now, we believe that the -- the position expressed here by the petitioner is one that is completely unsupportable because it disregards not only the language and the structure of the statute itself, but also its history, its interpretation, its manifest pertinence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.638" offset="16773935">Now, the basic principle for the transmission of citizenship under the common law was known as the used solely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.456" offset="16801207">That's the principle now incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.906" offset="16818970">The used (Inaudible), which is the principle of transmission by descent or by blood was not a common law principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.709" offset="16850213">This was dependent on statutes and statutes from the beginning of the republic had made limited provision for the transmission of citizens -- citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.938" offset="16899114">These provisions were in effect at different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.923" offset="16919071">Now, the 1802 Law which has been mentioned before was a codification, in every statement of earlier laws dealing with the transmission of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.176" offset="16964106">In the 1802 Law, as in Section 2172 of the revised statutes, the rights of citizenship were granted to the children of persons who now are or have been citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.842" offset="17026696">In 1854, Mr. Horace Binney, who was then a noted lawyer of the era, wrote an article in which he took the position that this law was not prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.072" offset="17067656">He said, “This was a bad thing and it should be corrected by Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.306" offset="17084583">The following year, Congress undoubtedly in response to his suggestion enacted section of the 1855 Act which is the predecessor of the Section 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.099" offset="17131813">That statute was effective as I have said heretofore or hereafter, both children heretofore born or hereafter born whose fathers are citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.579" offset="17189700">And the law also contained a condition that citizenship could not be transmitted unless the father had previously resided in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.131" offset="17231914">Now, Section 1993 was continued, it -- as I've said, it codified the 1855 Law and then it continued in effect until 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="4307.604" offset="17333791">The omission left out the proviso which precluded the transmission of citizenship unless the father had previously resided in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.584" offset="17377677">Now, I would like to make one additional point before I -- I show you what the significance of that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.250" offset="17412368">In 1934 when Congress amended Section 1993, Congress provided for the first time that citizenship could be transmitted by -- to a child born abroad to American citizen father or a mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.553" offset="17481540">And in making this change, Congress was careful to restrict the operation of the statute to children hereafter born, thus, very clearly denoting its wish not to disturb status that was previously vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.707" offset="17558235">Now, in order to succeed, petitioner must show first that the relevant provision of Section 2172, which is the second clause, was prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.557" offset="17625631">We believe that this contention depends on a number of -- of propositions which are unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.763" offset="17658441">In the first place, we point to the language of the statute and of course the language says, “The children of persons who now are or who have been citizens shall be citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.959" offset="17711208">This is not prospective language, particularly in the light of the legislative history which I'll develop in a moment and it is quite significant that when Congress wished to speak for the future, it had no difficulty in selecting appropriate language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.748" offset="17774320">Thus, in the 1855 Law and in its successor Section 1993, Congress spoke of the children of -- heretofore or hereafter born.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.457" offset="17833148">When Congress amended Section 1993, it spoke of the children hereafter born.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.253" offset="17864391">Now, no comparable language appears in the second clause of RS 2172, but second and more important, Your Honors will observe that this language, the second clause, was a virtually identical restatement of the 1802 Law as we've mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.534" offset="17953520">Yet, there was unanimous agreement that the language of the 1802 Law, the second clause, was not prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.113" offset="17991868">This was the point of view expressed by Mr. Horace Binney in his 1854 article.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.842" offset="18018722">It was apparently also shared by Congress in enacting the 1855 Law the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.824" offset="18046621">Indeed, in the debates on the 1855 Law, Congressman Cutting, the sponsor of the bill, and other members of Congress specifically said, “We acknowledge that the 1802 Law was not prospective and that the new legislation was needed to remedy the defect in the prior law.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4588.595" offset="18457788">The same conclusion was reached by every other lower court decision which has considered the matter and the same conclusion also was reached by Chancellor Kent in his commentaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="4609.971" offset="18543261">Now, our brief mentions the 14th edition of Chancellor Kent's commentaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.045" offset="18563532">Now, I've taken the trouble to search the earlier editions and find that every edition from the first edition in 1826 down through the 14th which we have cited, made exactly the same statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.641" offset="18613896">This included the 12th edition which was edited by one O. W. Holmes Jr, I find and which was published in 1873, the year before the revised statutes, is -- I think is quite significant as a part of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.384" offset="18680874">Now, petitioner now contends that every published interpretation of the 18 -- the revised statutes and the 1802 Law was wrong and that it is now possible to read this language as being prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.763" offset="18758405">We submit that in the face of the unanimous verdict of everybody, the verdict of the legal scholars including Chancellor Kent in 1826, Horace Binney in 1854, Justice Holmes in 1873, the verdict of the decisions including two leading expressions by this Court, the verdict of the legislative history including direct statements in the legislative history preceding the 1855 Law and another similar statement in the comprehensive study made in 1906 preceding the Citizenship Law of 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.206" offset="18920155">We submit that in the face of this unanimous verdict of everybody who has studied the subject that it is not now possible to read the language of the 1802 Law and of its restatement in 1874 as being prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.026" offset="18987447">Now, even if it could be found that the language is prospective and we've been -- this we deny, even if this could be found, we submit that petitioner still must fail, because petitioner's claim depends on a finding that 2172 intended to confer citizenship on the child born abroad to an alien father and a citizen mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.294" offset="19104580">Again, we say this interpretation conflicts irreconcilably with the consistent interpretation of the statute -- of this language with the statute itself and with its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.912" offset="19175006">Now, comparable language is business about the children or person.</text>

            <text syncTime="4776.410" offset="19208965">Comparable language was made -- was used in the 1802 Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.281" offset="19232475">Now, the use of the plural at that time and in 1874 was not an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.338" offset="19256717">It reflected the common law concept of family unity with the father, the spokesman of the unity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.062" offset="19287646">That concept of family unity was contained in our citizenship laws until 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.353" offset="19324740">That concept was endorsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.421" offset="19341040">In the leading decision of this Court in Mackenzie against Hare decided in 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.240" offset="19368312">When Congress used the word, “the children of persons” we believe it was referring to situations where both parents were citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.505" offset="19405406">Now, some authorities have construed this language a bit more liberally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.256" offset="19428394">Some authorities construing the first clause, not the second, there aren't any authorities taking this view under the second clause, the first clause related to the derivation of citizenship by the children of aliens who were naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.712" offset="19482206">Some authorities say that the first clause includes situation -- provision for the transmission of citizenship through a father, a father who was naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.559" offset="19529644">Now, we think that this perhaps is a permissible interpretation in the light of the common law concept of family unity which was then incorporated in our statutes, the father being the chief spokesman of the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.988" offset="19583352">Moreover, under our laws at that time, when an alien woman married a citizen, she automatically became a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.305" offset="19620551">So when Congress spoke of the children of persons, if the father was a citizen, both parents automatically were citizens, but we think that no interpretation of anybody, no Court, no commentator, no legislative spokesman has every suggested that it is possible to read the language of the 1874 revised statute Section 2172 or of its predecessor in 1802 as granting citizenship to a child born abroad to a citizen mother and an alien father.</text>

            <text syncTime="5187.055" offset="20851545">Your Honor, this I think has an explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.518" offset="20869413">This is -- gets to the crux of why there were two statutes dealing with the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.577" offset="20893654">Of course, we say that it is inconceivable that Congress intended two statutes enacted at the same time containing inconsistent conditions to operate prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.634" offset="20941928">The court below said that this -- the second clause was retained as a savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.653" offset="20977977">Now, if the second clause was intended to apply for the future as a method of transmitting citizenship, then it undoubtedly would have continued this proviso or something similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.134" offset="21035865">And that is so because in every other law dealing with the transmission of citizenship by American citizens to their children born abroad, every other law since 1790, Congress has inserted a specific proviso precluding the transmission of citizenship except where the citizen parent had previously resided in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.565" offset="21137638">This was true in the 1790 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.343" offset="21148714">It was true in the 1795, the 1802, the 1855 Law and in the revised statutes 1993, each of which said that citizenship rights could not be send unless the father had previously resided in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="5281.508" offset="21229380">No, but this is a consistent pattern of action by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.532" offset="21245471">Congress never has provided for the transmission of citizenship to children born abroad unless the father had some tie in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.315" offset="21284655">Congress wished to prevent the transmission of citizenship by generations of persons who had never resided in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.441" offset="21317151">That is the decision of this Court in Weedin against Chin Bow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.726" offset="21330317">That's very thoroughly spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.943" offset="21339094">Congress wanted to tie it, the transmission of citizenship to persons who had been in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.426" offset="21365112">Now, by eliminating this proviso in carrying forward the 1802 law into Section 2172, it seems to me, Congress very clearly indicated that it didn't want this law to have the effect for which petitioner contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.743" offset="21442330">Because if it were to operate prospectively as a means for transmitting citizenship by parents who were not citizens in 1874, then Congress would have included a proviso saying that citizenship could not -- cannot be transmitted unless the parents has previously resided in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.882" offset="21534908">Now, I want -- I want to get back for a moment to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.634" offset="21557896">On every occasion on which this matter has been considered, the legislative history tells us that the revised statute 18 -- 2172 and its predecessor of 1802 were not intended to confer rights of citizenship to children born abroad to American mothers and alien fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.623" offset="21665834">The first such expression was in connection with the debates on the Act of 1855 and there on page 34 of our brief, we -- we quote from a statement by Congressman Cutting who is the bill's sponsor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.052" offset="21731558">This was read by Miss Lavin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.435" offset="21737096">It says that, “We haven't gone as far as England in permitting the transmission of citizenship to children born abroad to American mothers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.365" offset="21776802">Now, when the next occasion arose which was 1922, in connection with the Cable Act, the Committee report which is quoted at -- at the top of page 35 of our brief said, “We are not disturbing the citizenship status of children, those born in this country take under the Constitution.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5689.018" offset="22859421">Now, the second claim which is made here is on the Act of March 2, 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.661" offset="22886066">The Act of March 2, 1907 was one of the numbers of basic revisions on naturalization and nationality laws from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.289" offset="22916577">It dealt primarily with expatriation and protection of citizens abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.159" offset="22936012">Section 3 of that Act provided that an American woman who married an alien, thereby lost her American citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="5738.697" offset="23058160">We think that also Section 5 is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5741.463" offset="23069236">Section 5 provided that a child born abroad of alien parents would become a citizen through the naturalization or resumption of citizenship by the mother during the child's minority.</text>

            <text syncTime="6013.245" offset="24156348">Now, we say such a -- an argument, such an interpretation gives to the American woman not inferior rights but far greater rights because it doesn't depend on a termination of the marriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="6207.151" offset="24931976">He did not decide that in every case, a child who was born an alien to a citizen mother would automatically become a citizen merely because the mother took a trip to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="6470.579" offset="25985651">But -- of course, in the -- in the laws under Victoria, we had the problem of holding property that they referred to more completely but that does not -- to the best of my knowledge obtained in any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.442" offset="26049181">We have a -- in this, I've urged upon the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.655" offset="26062033">I -- I think that in my argument, I indicated these expressions of Mr. Binney, an eminent scholar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.167" offset="26092022">This Court's appear it -- approbation of that expression but what I do try to urge upon this Court is that what later Congressmen might have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6509.446" offset="26141132">What -- what scholars might have said are -- are not to be conclusive in this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6517.646" offset="26173942">This Court -- a -- a judicial tribunal is the only one who has the right to determine the effect of statute and that is when the proper triad case arises and that is what now is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6533.068" offset="26235695">Now, I noticed that there was practically no argument on -- addressed to the distributive except the fact that between 1855 and 1874, we had a situation where a wife took the nationality of her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.012" offset="26307375">In our brief, we have -- in our reply brief, we have taken this argument of Mr. Gordon and we put it in what I -- in what I think is its proper posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="6562.427" offset="26353037">If a -- if a man passed citizenship to his wife by the fact of the Act of 1854, then there was actually no necessity for the Act to 1855.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.763" offset="26410402">But if we had a man passing his nationality to his wife, then we had a child who was a citizen of the United States and that wipes out the requirement of the five years residence by the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="6593.816" offset="26478634">Actually, the incongruity of the two of them is -- is obvious from that posture as well as from what Mr. Gordon urges as an incongruity in the subsistence of both statutes only in the inverse rather than in the way I suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.184" offset="26568077">I want to get to this 1907 argument, the termination quite particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.941" offset="26607156">Mr. Gordon does not seem to credit the Guest case where a -- a document, a contract between the two parties that one of them would have custody of the child was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="6639.813" offset="26662640">There was no termination of that marriage, there was a -- a contractual arrangement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="6648.276" offset="26696495">Also, Mr. -- the Attorney General, Mr. Mitchell, it was his expression that we must remember that custody isn't permanent despite the fact that Mr. Gordon's argument is that he would never made the -- the contention that are -- he would never have followed this decision unless custody were permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6670.181" offset="26784057">But Mr. Mitchell himself said, “We must recognize the custody is not always necessarily permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6675.007" offset="26803388">And as a matter of fact, there are cases where the father was given legal custody and the child still took the nationality of his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.828" offset="26842676">We -- in the 1934 Act though, we must remember that no termination was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="6692.758" offset="26874441">Mr. Gordon concedes the Black and -- Black decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.154" offset="26888025">He concedes the opinion of Mr. Mitchell in Cole-Picard and if no termination was required under the 1934 Act, then the declaration of Kelly -- Kelly versus -- the aspect in which Kelly versus Owen was decided by this Court would make Mr. Montana a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.223" offset="26968273">I -- I think there is -- I -- I think and I have urged in -- on the Seventh Circuit as well as this Court that the suggestion of Mr. Gordon that Mrs. Montana's testimony wasn't credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6732.439" offset="27033161">That Mrs. Montana's testimony was not to be believed at this -- at the appeal level because she was an interested witness, does not find any basis in the record and what he asked this Court to do is to make a finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6747.210" offset="27092198">I have set out in my reply brief every utterance of the Court relative to his acceptance of that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="6755.487" offset="27125321">There is nothing to indicate any incongruity on the part of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6760.149" offset="27143920">There is nothing to indicate that he discounted her testimony because of what was obviously be an interested of a mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="6770.253" offset="27184358">The -- the question of his refusal of the passport for a time has had I think a -- a reasonable corollary in the many cases that were before this Court and other courts of the United States where a foreign-born child of American citizens had tried to come into the this country by the time they reached their 16th birthday in order that they might complete their five years residence while they were still minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6800.982" offset="27307342">That has been consistently found to estop the Government from raising the manner of not conforming to that that five year requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.598" offset="27349765">Though the children were no in here at the time and the statute required five years residence before they attain their majority, the fact that the American Consul had held up there passports was determined to be no impediment to their citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.848" offset="27422804">Mr. Chief Justice referred to the certificate -- certificate of arrival.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.309" offset="27440567">I think it is a reasonable inference from the record that this -- certificate of -- of arrival was founded on some determination that the certificate of arrival was actually a official document by an official officer of the United States Government and should be given some credit in that regard.</text>
