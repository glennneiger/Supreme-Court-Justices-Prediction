            <text syncTime="12.132" offset="151907">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.197" offset="164133">At the conclusion yesterday, I called the Court's attention to the fact that the reviser of the 1948 Code, when that was -- and it's embodied in H.R. Bill 3190 and was reported to Judiciary Committee which -- which accompanied that bill and that at that time and the -- and that so far as conspiracies are concerned and if I may just read that long paragraph wherein the report states that a number of special conspiracy provisions relating to specific offenses which were contained in various sections incorporated in this title were omitted, because adequately covered by this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.144" offset="347930">A few exceptions were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.532" offset="357543">One, where conspiracy would constitute the only offense and two or where the punishment provided in this action would not be commensurate with the gravity of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.189" offset="408116">Special conspiracy provisions were retained in sections and then it gives a number of sections and then it's the -- of this title and then it says, conspiracy provisions were added to certain sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.750" offset="462346">Now, in each instance, it omits any reference to it that conspiracy to this section that is to -- to 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.370" offset="504874">We -- we state that the mere -- that even that fact, there's an indication that there was no intent at any time by the Congressional Committee or by Congress in passing that law to consider the conspiracy provision of this Act, as relayed into punishment any different than the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.430" offset="589093">And that all it considered was that it considered the entire Act that racketeering section was considered all and -- all as a force of one act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.857" offset="626813">And that the only reason that the various methods of violating the law were -- were prescribed was in -- in order to make sure that if a violation occurs, that a person could be considered as being guilty of a violation of law and could be punished.</text>

          <turn speaker="morris_a_shenker" startTime="153.430" stopTime="436.784">
            <label>Mr. Morris A. Shenker</label>
            <text syncTime="153.430" offset="717093">The -- that's at page 41 in the middle of the -- bottom of that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.650" offset="769964">Now it is -- of course, on situations of this nature, not considering the question even whether you could -- you can or it cannot have consecutive punishments for a conspiracy, as well as for the violation of the -- for a substantive violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.749" offset="846346">Of course, the legislative history is -- is very pertinent because after all that is the -- the part that -- that was -- would -- would govern when it becomes a question of intent of Congress and the discussion, all of the discussions in the legislative history, I'm again referring to it, relates only to this question of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.564" offset="949582">I should like to, if I may, call attention to the -- some of the discussion that was had in the -- in the petitioner's appendix and referring to -- to page 12 on top of the page which is from the 1889 Congressional Record, where -- where Mr. Delaney has said, the fact of the matter is that this committee report was not unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.944" offset="1059192">Also in the committee it was indicated by those in favor of this legislation, that a legislation is too drastic that the $10,000 fine and 20 years in jail is too drastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.687" offset="1106108">They think a modified -- they think a modified bill might be more in consonance with present day thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.000" offset="1131395">And then Mr. Fish continued on the same page and states, "I want to refer likewise to some of the excessive penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.616" offset="1169847">The penalties in this bill in my opinion were too severe, 20 years, and $10,000 fine."</text>
            <text syncTime="272.755" offset="1194402">When we reach this section of the bill, there should be very careful consideration given to reducing both the extent of the imprisonment and the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.595" offset="1233795">A reading -- and referring again to Congressman Celler and also on the same page on the -- on the appendix, at the bottom of page 12, Mr. Celler says, "Let me call your attention to one or two items in the bill which meet with my disfavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.750" offset="1302340">For example, the bill provides for a punishment of 20 years and/or a fine of $10,000."</text>
            <text syncTime="306.404" offset="1328985">Then it goes on to say, "Examine the antitrust statutes and you will find that malefactors under those statutes do not have to face a 20-year sentence."</text>
            <text syncTime="315.203" offset="1364198">Violations of the antitrust laws are equally detrimental to the body politic and or as much as crime as extortion or robbery as contemplated by the instant bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.103" offset="1407770">Now I'm citing this not only to show there was only 20 years but it also shows that in each instance, everyone, everyone of the Congressmen and the Committee rules and the discussion of the floors in each instance, they were treating this as a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.159" offset="1463986">They were treating this as -- as something that is -- that is to reach out to get group activity, that there wasn't a law that was passed for an individual, that it was -- rather it was a law that was passed to reach out to racketeering, to group activity rather than into individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.965" offset="1539218">Then Congressman Celler goes on, "If the extortion or robbery is of such magnitude that it ought to be prosecuted as a felony instead of a misdemeanor, then the prosecution should be under state law, it goes on to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.934" offset="1591150">In so far as the instant bill is concerned, it does not intend to punish extortion or robbery, as such since that would be a -- usurpation of state's functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.123" offset="1631901">It intends to punish activities which interfere with interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.987" offset="1651336">In that respect, it parallels the antitrust laws. Punishment for violations of which are likewise based on interference with interstate commerce, but in the one case where capital is involved, you have the penalty of one year and the R.A. case where labor is involved, you have the penalty of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.211" offset="1724165">Now, there is -- that shows all the thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.593" offset="1733778">Then we go on in there where Mr. Springer in discussion, Congressman Springer says, "May I ask my distinguished colleague on the Committee on the Judiciary if it is not a fact that under the provisions of this bill the question of penalty is left entirely discretionary with the court trying the case?"</text>
            <text syncTime="428.978" offset="1819251">Under the provisions of this bill, a person could be penalized to the extent of 1 year or less than 1 year or up to 20 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.062" offset="1903574">And -- and then, going on, this question, Mr. Springer was addressed to Congressman Celler on the Committee and continued on the same page.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.649" offset="1941922">Mr. Celler goes on, "Or his sentence might be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.577" offset="1961671">I agree with the gentleman, but why do we single out labor and impose even a possible penalty of 20 years?"</text>
            <text syncTime="472.021" offset="1991450">Psychologically, that is a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.249" offset="2004407">To my way of thinking especially since innocent labor acts, lawful acts might be inter -- indicted especially if my amendment shall not prevail, that will be ceased upon by everyone who has any opposition to the bill and will be exaggerated a lot important.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.553" offset="2077550">Then -- then they go on and -- and just quoting a portion of Mr. Hancock's, which is in the bottom of the page, to illustrate as to just what this bill was attempt -- what were they attempted to reach with that bill and Mr. Hancock says about the sixth line after the beginning of the paragraph it says, "It had its origin in the activities of the Dillinger gang.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.585" offset="2173680">All this Bill does is to abolish a double standard which Justice Burns established and makes labor responsible for crimes just as well as those who are not laborers, that is all it does."</text>
            <text syncTime="530.385" offset="2224880">Again, pointing out that they're talking about group activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.793" offset="2238568">Then going on to -- to page 14 of the -- of the appendix, into the bottom paragraph, it says in there that Mr. Celler again, "Justice Burns in his decision stated there was no attempt on the part of Congress to interfere with the traditional activities of labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.501" offset="2341386">We put into Copeland Act a specific provision which favored the traditional activities of labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.616" offset="2369808">Therefore, the original act as well as this bill is aimed at labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.790" offset="2386526">It seeks to do a way with the excesses or the racketeering of the Dillinger type.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.068" offset="2403662">That being the case, should not we have been more careful in providing penalties, rather than put a 20-year penalty in this bill, again showing that he is treating it as a group situation in the discussion and that all they're talking about is 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.939" offset="2463117">There's no mention that any time made of any consecutive sentences of any sentence that could possibly be in excess of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.083" offset="2511705">And to Mr. -- Mr. Sadowski goes on, on page 15 of the appendix, he says, Mr. Sadowski, "The most highly publicized anti-labor bill now before Congress is the Hobbs Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.751" offset="2562382">The sponsors of this bill call it an Anti-Racketeering Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.497" offset="2577324">We all agree that racketeering should be ended and that the punishment for racketeering should be severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.946" offset="2599163">However, there is already an anti-racketeering statute on federal law, which is called the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934."</text>
            <text syncTime="632.095" offset="2631764">And then he goes on, "The trouble with the Hobbs Bill is that it can be construed by the courts to prohibit and punish most of the legitimate activities of organized labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.610" offset="2669798">On that its provisions, a man who voted for a strike or walked the picket line was arrested and being sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison or be fined $10,000 or - or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.072" offset="2715669">Whatever the proponents of the proposed measure may say, the language of the Hobbs Bill is so broad that it constitutes a serious manner to all that organize labor has struggled for, blood for and even die it for through many decades."</text>
            <text syncTime="667.607" offset="2773765">Again, only talking about the 20 years and the $10,000 fine, then skipping to page 16 and -- and Mr. Robinson of Kentucky states, "There are some objections to the penalties prescribed in this bill for robbery and extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.786" offset="2870523">It has gone forth to the country that the penalty is 20 years."</text>
            <text syncTime="696.031" offset="2887450">That is not a correct statement and obviously Mr. Robinson was for the bill and he says, "That is not a correct -- the penalties range from 1 hour and up to 20 years, according to the offense, and to the offense and fines of $1 to $10,000."</text>
            <text syncTime="712.721" offset="2954219">In other words, the 20 years and the $10,000 fine were the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.746" offset="2974386">The Court can fix any length of time of imprisonment up to 20 years or any fine up to $10,000 or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.886" offset="3010957">Now, again, it illustrates the -- the thinking in -- in that matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.010" offset="4883414">This bill has direct relation to the antitrust laws, the Clayton Act, examine those acts and see what you do to the manufacturers and organizations."</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.242" offset="4920299">And then he goes on, finally, skipping a little, you inflict the penalty of only $5000 but on the laboring men, you inflict the penalty of $10,000 or in the alternative 20 years in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.640" offset="4973902">If -- if that is not a portion on justifiable penalty, I would like to know what is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.919" offset="4991039">Again, only talking about the 20 years and it's certainly reasonable to assume that if there was any other consideration, here, you have a mandate that would oppose to the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.026" offset="5035447">You have a number of Congressmen that would oppose to the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.959" offset="5047254">And if they could have construed it and even thought that the bill could be construed, that in any matter at all as inflicting a punishment greater than 20 years, they would have said, now, not only can they get 10 -- 20 years on long part but if he's also guilty of conspiracy, he can get 20 years for conspiracy and 20 years for the substantive offense which would have made it 40 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.148" offset="7103927">Now, their main question and only one to which agree is here, is whether a person who has conspired to violate the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act and then also extorts money from the victim which is a violation of the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act, can be sentenced for both crimes under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.490" offset="7213328">Now, the facts, I think, while they've been mentioned, might take a little -- a minute to clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.711" offset="7254183">There are two counts involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.110" offset="7267767">First count was for was for conspiracy and the second count was a substantive crime of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.492" offset="7297337">The petitioner and others are -- were convicted by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.897" offset="7318967">The sentence was 12 years on Count I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.255" offset="7336417">On Count II, the sentence was a consecutive sentence of 12 years which was suspended and then the petitioner was placed on probation for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.810" offset="7390647">The five-year probation period begins at the end of the sentence on Count I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.512" offset="7421471">As a matter of fact now, of course, the petitioner is out on parole even from the first sentence and it is our -- and the only reason we mention this is because while the petitioner originally was confined, when he started this proceeding and therefore he asked only for four years off of his first sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.065" offset="7515617">Now that he is no longer confined, we can recognize that he has nothing as great to gain by getting only four years off the sentence. Consequently, both sides have somewhat changed since the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.565" offset="7581654">So that now, the problem is in total, we see it whether or not, you can have cumulative sentences under this Act, regardless of the length, the particular length that they may happen to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.986" offset="7643303">Now, we both use the same material, it's true.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.677" offset="8130121">If there is a problem here, it arises long before the Hobbs Bill becomes the law because in 1934, this conspiracy clause is also here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.920" offset="8171081">Now, this recitation of history to us should be read as merely the same thing that the bill says.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.336" offset="8232730">We don't think this settles the problem at all, because just to reiterate what the Bill itself says doesn't add to the -- to our knowledge of what the intent was insofar as cumulative sentences are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.190" offset="8688097">First of all, the background is that in -- from 1879 on, this Court has maintained a consistent pattern of cases involving both the crimes of conspiracy and the crime of a substantive act and in each and every case since 1879, that this Court has had the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.571" offset="8809618">This Court has held that the conspiracy is separate from the substantive crime and that the punishment can be accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.962" offset="8859251">Now, we have outlined in our brief from that first case, the various facets of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.252" offset="8892374">In other words, it made no difference how the argument arrived here, whether it arrived because someone claimed double jeopardy, whether it arrived because there was a different statute of limitations to be applied, whether it arrived because the person that was being tried for conspiracy could not be charged with the substantive or whether it arrived because there were different types of punishments for the substantive as compared to the conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.094" offset="13527751">It doesn't go to the type of offense unless you have the type of offense where you have a merger problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.355" offset="13576756">In other words, I don't view conspiracy as anything but a criminal offense and I don't view extortion as anything but a criminal offense and hence, the question of whether there are two or three substantives and one conspiracy, I view all on an equal basis and an unquestionable power to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.387" offset="13704965">I would say they all can be punished at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.508" offset="13713429">Now, I can recognize that it is easier to visualize as -- possibly because as lawyers, it is easier to visualize separate substantive offenses as being somewhat different than a conspiracy and a substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.457" offset="13805171">And I think that is -- that difference I can recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.563" offset="13821576">But I don't think it goes to the question of whether or not, it does go to either of these two but it doesn't go to a question whether you can separately punish and it doesn't aid us on the question of whether or not, Congress in this Act intended one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.924" offset="13903078">I can recognize there is a different view.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.252" offset="13916348">Mr. Gilinsky as to the question put by Justice Harlan, rationally, as an abstract consideration, there is no difficulty in force of having Congress when it make offenses in relation within a given territory of outlawed conduct that all offenses within that area of criminal or penal decision that it makes -- that it says that all -- all offenses within a particular penal area, shall upon the punishment, upon the guilt of one or all, be subject to a single defined punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.344" offset="14096697">There's nothing -- there's nothing in a way of reason or penology that it's now, why they shouldn't do that, but we're dealing with situation where there's -- where there is a purpose in the consideration, ambiguity, the language of allows one construction rather another in the imposition of multiple sentences and I should think that where you -- that abstractly considered where you have -- as Justice Harlan's question indicated I think, conspiracy and a substantive offence as against substantive offenses in the reference to a particular situation, conspiracy and substantive offense present different considerations than fragmentized substantive offenses within the same area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.026" offset="14307453">Because when you deal with conspiracy, you add the very important consideration of -- of danger or menace to the society from combined action, which is a very different thing from the commission of a substantive offense by one or more people because that is the great thing about conspiracy that it's directed against the mischief conceived by penalizing such combination because of combination and not because of the substantive offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3643.223" offset="14676302">I -- I think there are other considerations for the conspiracy also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.768" offset="14694484">For instance, in this particular context, conspiracy is a very dangerous anti-social act because in -- in the field of racketeering, it presents a focal point for continuing crime, which you don't usually have in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.209" offset="14788211">It also -- a conspiracy has this as a background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.493" offset="14805347">It makes it much more difficult for anyone individual to get out because he has the -- his cohorts of course, on his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.583" offset="14845680">All of these considerations though have gone into the long history of why conspiracy is separate from the substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.860" offset="14882774">In this particular Act, we think though that even the legislative history backs us up more than the petitioner's counsel has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.050" offset="14923525">When the bill was first submitted in 1934, it's true the Act did not contain a conspiracy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.380" offset="14964903">However, that conspiracy clause was put in as the Act was going through Congress and there's no question where it came from because at that time, the then Attorney General Homer Cummings, wrote a letter in which he submitted a new brand in which he says in no uncertain terms, we have had it, a conspiracy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.119" offset="15071796">Now, the Government suggested that this must be read in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.992" offset="15103352">Now, what do we mean in context here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.113" offset="15115786">At the time the Attorney General suggested this, there was a conspiracy clause, a general conspiracy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.358" offset="15152776">So that, you didn't have to have the addition of a conspiracy clause in the Hobbs Act, in order to convict someone of conspiracy because that was already on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.644" offset="15217977">But the problem was that in 1934, they were concerned about increasing the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.672" offset="15250056">And in 1934, the conspiracy had -- had a punishment clause of two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.953" offset="15279208">Now, we suggest that the Attorney General when he said that he's having a conspiracy clause meant not that he was adding something that he couldn't do before, because he could.</text>

            <text syncTime="5160.964" offset="20747264">This is not a question of what Congress could have done if they had thought about the problem because we feel it's the other way that if they had said, they didn't want this, which would have reversed the entire trend, that's what they should have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.349" offset="20808808">In other words if Congress was going to say anything, they have to say it the other way rather than say, “We want to have cumulative punishment because all the statutes always have cumulative punishments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.603" offset="20857814">In other words, we think there's a particular force in this statute that extortion can be committed alone and that's the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.855" offset="20902745">That a conspiracy can be committed without the extortion, that there are separate, they have ingredients that are separate and they've always been so considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.425" offset="20945063">And they've been transposed back and forth, in and out of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.643" offset="20961991">When we revised the code in -- in 1948, they took out conspiracies from a lot of statute, but they didn't feel that there was any change in punishment and they said there wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.567" offset="21005667">So they treat these conspiracy clauses all the same, it doesn't make any difference whether they're in 371 which is the present section or whether they're in some particular -- except for two things punishment or if it's the only crime that's involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="5259.060" offset="21139623">Since the main thrust of the Government's argument has been directed at this question that Congress was following a long doctrine in conspiracy substantive offense cases, I think the first thing I should direct my attention to is this long doctrine and it's this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.440" offset="21249128">This long doctrine which Mr. Gilinsky refers to in all of the cases with the possible exception of this court-martial case did the issue of cumulative sentences arise?</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.909" offset="21319032">All these cases merely held that a conspiracy and a substantive offense are separate and distinct crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.761" offset="21370441">In this respect, let me start out with the Pinkerton case and the American Tobacco case, which were decided in June 1946, subsequent to the time the Hobbs Act was passed the House and prior to the final passage in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.271" offset="21452466">And in this connection, it in both Pinkerton and -- and the American Tobacco Company case, the issue was that this Court had decided, Braverman versus United States, with -- which held the issue in the Braverman case was, suppose you have a conspiracy, one conspiracy to commit various substantive offenses, what sort of punishment maybe imposed?</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.454" offset="21557164">And the Court in the Braverman case, held that the -- you only could punish the conspiracy and the maximum punishment was the punishment authorized by the conspiracy section -- statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.540" offset="21617560">Then in both the Pinkerton and the American Tobacco case, they argued the converse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.009" offset="21643368">They said, here, we have a whole group of substantive offenses which were committed pursuant to one conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.274" offset="21680462">Therefore, they argued, there is a merger and therefore, we should not be punished more than the punishment for the one conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.771" offset="21726438">And this Court held no, that the -- that there could be punishment for each of the substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.852" offset="21762800">Now also, because I think it has some bearing on this, in the Pinkerton case, the Court decided there was a conflict of circuits that a -- a conspirator who did not participate in the substantive offense, might be guilty of the substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.575" offset="21857677">Prior to that time, some circuits have said yes and some no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.071" offset="21875649">Now, the other cases relative to the separateness of the conspiracy and the substantive offense were in general cases which said that a conspiracy might be subject to a general statute or limitations and the substantive offense to a special statute of limitation that a conspiracy wasn't petty offense, that a -- a conspiracy could be punished more severely than the substantive offense or that punishment that Congress had the power, therefore, there was no double jeopardy to punish separately, conspiracy and the substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.683" offset="22026115">That the punishment, again, with the punishment for conspiracy would be greater than a substantive offense that a clear -- that liability for conspiracy is not taken away by its excess and a conspiracy may have a different statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.810" offset="22086614">And none of these cases except for this Carter case, which was a basically, a double jeopardy case did they state that cumulative punishment might be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.075" offset="22131649">Now, this Carter versus McClaughry was a court-martial case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.064" offset="22147636">There were four charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.031" offset="22155473">Under two of the charges, there was a -- which arose under one Article of war, the -- they -- this Article of War had been based on a statute which provided a fine and a punishment for conspiring and also for making false claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.221" offset="22244289">When -- when the Article of War was enacted, the words became fine or punishment and Carter paid the fine and he contended that he was entitled to be released because he had served -- that he had complied with the sentence and he couldn't receive both a fine or a punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.682" offset="22322134">The Court first said that when the statute used the word -- oh, when the Article of War used the word “or” it meant and. But then they said, in any event there's no double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.566" offset="22369677">Furthermore, as in old court-martial cases, Carter received the gross sentence and there was a -- a charge under -- charge for in this particular case, in which he was sentenced for embezzlement and the entire sentence could have been sustained on the embezzlement charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.775" offset="22454523">Now, in connection with this problem of merger -- now, we don't say just because a -- there is a conspiracy and a substantive offense, that they automatically merge in sort of put to -- blinders on the Court and say, well the Court can't consider the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.699" offset="22550131">We say rather that it's necessary for the Court to consider the purpose and intent of the legislation and if the purpose and intent is to punish as a unit, then no cumulative punishment can be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.862" offset="22630797">Now, the real -- I mean, just I go back at second, in connection with this problem of whether that -- of this long standing doctrine that the Government argues, we set forth a Committee Report in 1944, this is on page 25 of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.480" offset="22733302">This is a Committee Report in which the Congress in 1944 had the problem that in counterfeiting cases, the ring leaders were only being sentenced to two years for the -- for conspiring to violate the counterfeiting laws and the participants were being sentenced for sometimes as much as the maximum which was 15 years, for committing a substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.628" offset="22861928">So the result, the -- the Congress enacted a law in which they made a conspiracy to violate the counterfeit laws subject to the same penalty, 15 years as the substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.289" offset="22936534">Nowhere is there an indication that what they were doing was not making a 15-year penalty, but making a 30-year penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.403" offset="22969031">And we're just -- we put this in for an illustration to show that this doctrine wasn't -- wasn't well-established like Mr. Gilinsky states it is. Now, when we look to the purpose and intent of this legislation and that's what -- what I think the main problem is in any legislation, when we start out, we see that initially, there was an investigation and -- into racketeering and the -- there were hearings held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.824" offset="23150634">There was testimony given in which an Attorney General and several -- and another professor defined racketeering and they defined that crime, as a crime committed by organized groups. And then eventually, Mr. Rice of the Attorney General's Office, set forth, draft -- and made the first draft of the measure and in the first draft of the measure, there was no conspiracy clause and he specifically stated the reason while that -- while the Act was directed primarily against groups -- group action, that the reason he excluded the combination was to ease the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.468" offset="23341223">And then subsequently, when labor objected to the bill, they -- it was, Mr. Cummings, drafted it a second time and in that draft which also had this 99-year penalty, the -- the conspiracy section was added.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.688" offset="23438085">But the -- the whole purpose of the -- the legislation, was to -- to hit at these groups and -- and to prevent them from interfering with interstate commerce. And then also when -- when the legislation, the 1946 Act was enacted, its history also was directed at practices against groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.365" offset="23556786">Local 807 case was a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.281" offset="23572459">The entire discussion of the -- of -- of Congress in the -- in the -- based on the 1946 Act, was directed at this group combined action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.424" offset="23629093">Now, we say that this is the controlling gloss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5887.022" offset="23651453">The controlling gloss is that Congress wished to cover these groups and to punish the groups and that the only reason for adding this conspiracy section and for adding these various alternative substantive provisions which overlap, was so that everybody who participated in any aspect of the crime would be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.941" offset="23771094">In other words, Congress was interested in easing the burning -- burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.462" offset="23793246">They -- it was not interested in piling punishment upon punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.159" offset="23840057">Certainly, we don't -- we do not think that this statute -- we think that the available materials indicate that Congress did not intend cumulative punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5948.085" offset="23895751">We think that if -- if anybody in the 1942 and 1943 debates had thought that Congress intended cumulative punishment, they would have indicated and argued that the bill so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5965.513" offset="23965445">When you consider that factor that Congress' main concern was with combination and wasn't primary combinations that interfered with interstate commerce, when you consider that factor, we think that the legislative history when considering with that purpose, indicates that no consecutive punishment was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.111" offset="24071816">In any event, that there's no reason for not -- for treating this separate mistake from any other case where there are two substantive offenses involved, the same policy considerations are involved for applying the rule of -- lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.415" offset="24145063">The -- the fact that -- that a combination might be a greater evil, it doesn't have any additional weight in this sentence, in this legislation, because the combination itself was the evil at which the substantive offense was directed and the only reason that combination was not required as an element was to ease the proof and to make all violators in any degree, and all inchoate crimes punishable and for that reason, we think the court below erred in imposing cumulative punishments.</text>
