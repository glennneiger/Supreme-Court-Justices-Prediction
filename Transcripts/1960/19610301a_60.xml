            <label>Mr. Fowler V. Harper</label>
            <text syncTime="23.858" offset="199847">Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.260" offset="213431">These three appeals derived from three cases, initiated simultaneously in the lower courts of the State of Connecticut, went to the Supreme Court of Errors and are here now on appeal under U.S.C. 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.048" offset="292634">As a matter of fact, they were consolidated here for oral argument because they raised the same federal question, although the three cases raised them -- raised it in somewhat slightly different factual contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.238" offset="349372">Now, these are the cases, three cases, Your Honor, Doe versus Ullmant -- Ullman, Poe versus Ullman and Buxton versus Ullman.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.085" offset="404752">Now, these are the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.131" offset="412902">Appellant Doe is a woman now 27 years of age, who lives in New Haven with her husband, 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.561" offset="446652">They have no living children.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.184" offset="457101">Four years ago, Mrs. Poe became ill with a cardiovascular ailment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.154" offset="493046">She also became pregnant and developed toxemia pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.329" offset="513735">In these circumstances, her physician, who was appellant Buxton, decided that the best way to save her life was to terminate the pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.094" offset="552814">I might add that under law of Connecticut, it is lawful to terminate the pregnancy of a woman in order to save her life, although it is not lawful to advice and have her use a contraceptive to prevent her becoming pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.186" offset="605163">She was admitted to the Greystone Haven Hospital in this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.086" offset="620732">Before they could carry out this procedure, however, appellant Doe suffered a severe cerebral hemorrhage.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.391" offset="653960">She was unconscious for two weeks in a critical condition for nine weeks, during which time it was necessary to carry out several lifesaving procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.909" offset="696069">Now, in these circumstances, her physician came to the conclusion that the lesser risk for her life would be to let the pregnancy go full term rather than subject her to the operation to terminate her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.504" offset="754375">It did go full term.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.903" offset="760017">She delivered a stillborn fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.845" offset="771824">She was subsequently discharged from the hospital, the same heart ailment, paralyzed partially, she has no use of her left arm, she wears a sling, she wears her left leg in a pulley clamp, she had to learn to talk all over because of paralysis of her face.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.462" offset="838280">Her physician has told her that another pregnancy will probably result in her death.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.245" offset="857401">She then asked Dr. Buxton to prescribe for her the best treatment for her -- a woman in her condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.548" offset="890629">Dr. Buxton said, "Yes, I have knowledge of the best medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.680" offset="907139">It will be to prescribe for you and for -- to you to use certain drugs, medicinal articles and devices to prevent another pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.442" offset="938172">"However, he said, "I cannot prescribe them because the appellee," State's Attorney here, "claims that this would be a violation of a Connecticut statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="217.714" offset="975266">That statute provides that this is a criminal offense for any person to use an article, drug or device to prevent conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.973" offset="1016330">The appellee further claims, appellee Ullman, that he will prosecute any violation of this law, as indeed he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.344" offset="1049767">In State versus Nelson, when he procured a conviction of a physician and two nurses, his assistants, for violating the accessory law, which makes a person a criminal in the same degree for aiding and abetting another person committing a crime.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fowler V. Harper</label>
            <text syncTime="256.697" offset="1131165">That's the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.394" offset="1133986">Yes, sir.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fowler V. Harper</label>
            <text syncTime="258.529" offset="1138479">That is a basis because prescribing -- the Court held in State versus Nelson that for a physician to prescribe for a woman, the use of a contraceptive device, was aiding and abetting her in the commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.876" offset="1195948">And under a Connecticut statute, the general accessory statute, he is liable as the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.713" offset="1215279">There was on that basis the Dr. Nelson and the two nurses were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.227" offset="1233356">Now, in these circumstances, appellant Doe claimed that she had a constitutional right to protect her life by the best medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.409" offset="1278077">And that these laws violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.018" offset="1296468">And she had a declaratory judgment action that asked the Connecticut court so to declare.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.727" offset="1319351">Appellee Ullman demurred to the complaint, thus submitting all the facts which I've just related.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.745" offset="1339413">The demurrer was sustained by the lower court, affirmed by the Court of Errors and the case is here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.043" offset="1364595">Now, in the case of Poe, it's somewhat similar but the factual situation is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.869" offset="1387896">Mrs. Poe is a woman, 30 years old, her husband is 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.639" offset="1402943">He's a businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.464" offset="1406286">They lived together in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.088" offset="1412765">They have no living children.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.786" offset="1423527">Mrs. Poe has been pregnant three times, each time delivering a child with mentally -- mentally defective and physically defective, with both mental and physical abnormalities inconsistent with life.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.283" offset="1481519">Each of these children died within 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.314" offset="1497610">Now, Mrs. Poe has asked appellee -- appellant Dr. Buxton to prescribe for her, and he's made the same answer to her that he made to Mrs. Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.166" offset="1537108">Appellant Poe then rather declaratory judgment action just as Mrs. Doe did, claiming that she had a constitutional right to use the best medical means to prevent the birth of further mongoloid children.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.353" offset="1581829">And the emotional travail which it had already caused this couple three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.816" offset="1599697">The same result, demur -- admitting all these facts sustained -- affirmed by the Supreme Court of Errors here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.772" offset="1631462">Dr. Buxton brings his action in his own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.235" offset="1649330">He does not claim that this law deprives him under the Fourteenth Amendment, of his life or his liberty as to appellants Doe and Poe.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.618" offset="1682871">Dr. Buxton claims that this deprives him of his property and his liberty without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.424" offset="1706068">Because he says, "I cannot practice medicine according to my oath, according to my conscience and according to the highest standards of medical science."</text>
            <text syncTime="411.658" offset="1750998">Now, these are the three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.345" offset="1757790">Actually -- technically, I suppose they raised two questions, both under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.204" offset="1785166">Does this Connecticut law forbidding the use of contraceptives, take the life and liberty of Doe's and Poe's without due process of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="429.495" offset="1822365">The second technical question is, does the anti-contraceptive law, in connection with the accessory law, as applied to Dr. Buxton, deprived him of his property and his liberty without due process of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.203" offset="1873251">Actually, they boil down to the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.649" offset="1882969">Because it is clear that if a law forbidding the use of a contraceptive device is constitutional, then certainly Dr. Buxton will be guilty under the accessory statute for prescribing these devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.172" offset="1929049">On the other hand, if the anti-contraceptive law is unconstitutional, it's perfectly clear that Dr. Buxton will not be guilty of any crime by prescribing the use of these contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.933" offset="1972099">Now, Your Honors, the argument of these appellants can be stated rather simply as to its pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.677" offset="2003132">It depends upon four propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.410" offset="2013999">One, that if these laws constitute a serious threat to life and personal liberty, the State must justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.324" offset="2053705">Secondly, these laws do constitute a serious threat to life and personal liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.050" offset="2084634">Third, there is no justifying, countervailing interest of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.959" offset="2108249">And fourth, notwithstanding these three propositions, if necessary, these appellants are perfectly willing to assume the burden of demonstrating that the serious threat to life and the outrageous invasions of personal liberty so up, so far out way any presumed or illusory or actual advantages of this law in the interest of public health or morality, that there is no reasonable basis whatever on which they can stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.433" offset="3790117">I might add to Mr. Justice Clark in the recent Don Juan case, his language implying precisely the same when he said, "It's not for this Court to limit the State in its selection of a remedy to be most effective to cope with such problem, absent, of course, a showing upon reasonable scriptures on individual liberty resulting from its application in particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.714" offset="3879246">We expect to show serious threat to life as well as in invasion of civil liberties."</text>
            <text syncTime="949.796" offset="3903592">Now, Your Honor, I realize that these statements and most of the cases supporting them are cases involving First Amendment liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.674" offset="3943090">Mostly -- for the most -- for the most part, freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.052" offset="3956569">But it is submitted that the right to live is as important, at least, as a right to speak freely.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.027" offset="3992513">After all, the right to speak freely is of little use to a person whose powers of utterance had been silenced by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.887" offset="4027935">Moreover, there are other cases, and I should like to point -- point out that many of the cases involving property, business, freedom in the marketplace, in which this Court has imposed a burden upon the person's challenging the law, are not at all to be acquainted with the situation here involving an invasion of civil liberty, personal liberty and life itself, the threat to life itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.865" offset="4143815">Now, appellee, in its brief, refers to Dr. Buxton in pointing out that his property really is negligible here, that the fees which he will derive from abetting a woman for vaginal diaphragm must be a negligible part of his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.455" offset="4206195">And indeed, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.439" offset="4210166">Actually, it's no part of his income at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.040" offset="4220510">Dr. Buxton does not receive the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.769" offset="4231481">They go to the clinic in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.526" offset="4238482">He's a professor upbringing on a salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.247" offset="4249349">So, Dr. Buxton is not interested in fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.881" offset="4263873">What Dr. Buxton is interested in is not property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.170" offset="4281114">Dr. Buxton is not selling insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.564" offset="4290623">He's not running a brokerage firm, not operating a series of billboards for advertising purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.578" offset="4314760">Dr. Buxton is interested in saving the life and preserving the health of his patients and fees have nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.309" offset="4345584">What he wants to do is to practice medicine according to his conscience and according to the highest standards of medical science.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.496" offset="4374424">Now, the cases, therefore, involving property it seems to me are not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.462" offset="4394277">Certainly, it requires a great deal of more important interest to justify the invasion of personal liberties as such in this case and that serious threat to life that it does in those cases, which involve only money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.552" offset="4462613">Now, secondly, do these laws constitute a serious threat to life or health and personal liberty?</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.374" offset="4489885">Appellant Doe will die of another pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.126" offset="4504931">It is conceded that the best methods to prevent another pregnancy are forbidden by these laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1113.854" offset="4559788">This is interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.921" offset="4568043">This Court has held in Buck versus Bell that under of the Constitution of the United States, a State may, by compulsion, against the will of a feeble-minded woman, sterilize her in order to prevent her from having feeble-minded children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.839" offset="4639723">The State of Connecticut has a law which prevents a woman from using approved medical treatment to prevent her from having another mongoloid child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.268" offset="4681519">Certainly, the Constitution cannot be that erratic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.512" offset="4698446">Therefore, there are serious sentence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.936" offset="4712135">What State of Connecticut says to these women is this, "Yes, you may try to save your life and your emotional and physical health, but only by the methods least likely to succeed."</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.138" offset="4768977">What are those methods?</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.287" offset="4777545">Well, in the Tileston case, the Court suggested that the safe period or rhythm period would not come within the band of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.683" offset="4823103">Now, the rhythm system as Dr. Rock, who studied these problems, has described it is one way people have children and the data appears to -- to vary amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.234" offset="4889349">In a poll taken by Dr. Guttmacher over 3000 doctors, this is in the brief at page 15, only 1.4% of the doctors regarded the rhythm system as a reliable way to prevent conception, 1.4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.238" offset="4969388">Now, as to abstinence, the Court in Tileston said that abstinence was a reasonable alternative and therefore, the law was not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.631" offset="5018917">The Court said, "Do the frailties of human nature, the uncertainties of human passions render abstinence an unreasonable way to avoid conception?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.384" offset="5053921">The Court concluded that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.691" offset="5063116">But as you will notice in the same table that I just quoted, that 98.5% of the physicians polled disagreed with the Supreme Court of Connecticut on the medical treatment for women who will die with another pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.750" offset="5115361">In other words, only 1.5%, I should say negligibly fractional agreed with the Supreme Court of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.943" offset="5148170">Now, Your Honors, I should like to clear a way a little beyond the brush in this -- in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.601" offset="5174815">The court below, in its opinion disposing of all three of these cases, spent a good bit of time considering questions which have been raised in other cases, but not in this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.999" offset="5220373">In -- in the first case, Nelson against the State, which came to this Court or which was -- has gone to the Supreme Court of Errors, the second case, Tileston versus Ullman, which did reach this Court but was dismissed on the ground that the doctor had no standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.317" offset="5273663">He was asserting the constitutional rights of his patients and not of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.078" offset="5288709">In both of those cases, it was urged by petitioners that the Court should lead an exception into the law as indeed it had read -- as indeed there was an exception expressly in the abortion law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.663" offset="5355060">Abortion was illegal except for the purpose of saving a life of a woman, of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.005" offset="5376376">Now, it was argued, but certainly the legislature, in the much less serious matter of contraception, must have intended a similar exception there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.204" offset="5413261">That question was raised in both the Nelson and the Tileston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.179" offset="5425068">Actually, the Supreme Court of Errors turned the argument back upon the petitioners and said, "The legislature expressed and stated the exception in the abortion statute, if it intended one here, it would've put it in."</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.044" offset="5468536">Now, that question was disposed of in two cases by the Supreme Court of Errors interpreting a Connecticut statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.294" offset="5489539">These appellants did not raise that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.700" offset="5499152">They accepted that interpretation of the court of Connecticut and the question of an exception being read in by the Court was never raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.801" offset="5523602">Yet, the court below in its opinion spends substantial amount of the opinion discussing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.472" offset="5546277">Also in that opinion, there are considerable discussions and -- concerning the three departments of Government and how one department cannot encroach on another and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.806" offset="5583579">The court below, in its opinion in the Supreme Court of Errors, disposed of this case in one paragraph only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.821" offset="5611687">The substance of which was, we admit, that the forbidden contraceptives of the best medical treatment that abstinence is a reasonable alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.327" offset="5645751">And that, Your Honors, is a position taken by the Supreme Court of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.635" offset="5666962">Now, as to abstinence itself, there's a great deal of evidence, medical evidence in our brief and the brief of amicus curiae, to indicate that abstinence is unhealthy as well as impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.876" offset="5731850">And as a matter of fact, they stated to which I just referred, only 1.5% of the doctors said that they would prescribe abstinence as a method of preventing conception for woman whose life would be in danger by another pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.068" offset="5800709">In other words, 1.5% of the medical profession according to this poll, over 3000 doctors, agrees with the Supreme Court of Errors that abstinence is a perfectly practical and a reasonable alternative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1491.503" offset="6070397">Now, Your Honors, I should like to refer to the invasion of civil liberties, that is to say the liberty of the marital relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.434" offset="6118149">Only last year, the Court of Appeals of New York decided that a man was entitled to a degree of separation from his wife on the grounds of abandonment because she declined to have sexual intercourse with him and the declamation was on religious grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.865" offset="6179903">It so happened that this couple had been married by civil wedding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.971" offset="6192232">The lady subsequently having been advised by her spiritual adviser that she was -- had not been married according to the Church, declined to have marital relationship with her husband until they had been married according to the Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.980" offset="6240298">He declined -- the Court of Appeals granted him a separation on the ground that his wife had abandoned him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.462" offset="6266211">Judge Ford said sexual relations between men and women are given a socially and legalized sanction, only when they take place in marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.067" offset="6308634">And in turn, marriage is a self-distinguished from all other social relationships by the role of sexual intercourse between the parties placed in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.722" offset="6339250">This being so, it may not be doubted, that a total and irrevocable negation of what is lawful in marriage and unlawful in every other relationship or what unmistakably and uniquely characterizes marriage in no other relationship, constitutes abandonment in the eyes of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.737" offset="6407377">I might add that only last year, the English court in Louis versus Lillie, I give you a citation because it's not in the brief, 30 English Reports 283, made a -- the same decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.354" offset="6457846">Now, I'd also like to quote very briefly from Lord's Stairs Institute, this is a book which Dean Langdell has said once to have described as a comparatively recent textbook published in 1681.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.953" offset="6536213">In Lord's Stairs Institute, we find this written, "So then, it is not the consent of marriage as it relateth to the procreation of children that is requisite, for it may consist, though the woman be far beyond that date, but it is the consent whereby ariseth that conjugal society which may have a conjunction of bodies as well as of minds, has the general end of the institution of marriage, which is the solace and satisfaction of man."</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.577" offset="6650734">In a case just a few years ago, Baxter versus Baxter in which the English court held that a marriage had been consummated even though the husband refused to have marital intercourse with his wife, except by the use of a shield -- sheath, a condom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.891" offset="6720010">He brought an action on the ground that the marriage hadn't been consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.905" offset="6732027">The court held that it had been in Baxter versus Baxter, Lord -- Chief Justice Jowitt quoted the passage which I've just read from the institutes and concluded his opinion with the words, "I am content to adopt these words as my own, so too are these appellants."</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.649" offset="6834949">Now, Your Honors, what has Dr. Buxton to say to Mrs. Doe, appellant Doe?</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.578" offset="6870685">He's to say to Mrs. Doe, "Yes, I have warned you that another pregnancy will cause you your life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.672" offset="6903077">Yes, I know the best medical treatment for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.887" offset="6915929">That's sanctioned by all, but a negligible fraction for the medical profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.446" offset="6934215">But I cannot so prescribe, the law forbids it, I will go to jail, probably lose my license if I give you the best medical advice for your difficulties."</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.924" offset="6984056">And he says, "I know you're only 27 years old, your husband's only 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.944" offset="7000148">Well, all I can say is Mrs. Doe, the home is good a wife as possible, but never have marital intercourse with her as long as she'll live."</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.084" offset="7044765">And the Poes -- nothing wrong with the Poes except something wrong with the genes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.123" offset="7076843">The reason Mrs. Poe has these mentally defective children is because of some genetic problem, which the specialists have not been able to diagnose to the point of making an adequate prognosis and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.471" offset="7130237">Now, I suppose the Poes have suffered about the cruelest tragedies that any married couple can experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.909" offset="7160017">And yet they are deprived of what men in all ages have found to be the greatest solace for life's extreme tragedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.014" offset="7204425">And I don't suppose to be much of a consolation to Mrs. Poe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.165" offset="7225010">That if she was asked to read the opinion of the Court of Errors again, when the Court said that "The frailties of human nature and the uncertainties of passion do not make abstinence an unreasonable or impractical alternative."</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.854" offset="7283837">Now, to go further, Your Honors, and suggest that these laws mercilessly invade the privacy of a married couple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.242" offset="7333366">In Board of Education versus Barnette, Mr. Justice Jackson pointed out the flags of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.305" offset="7369624">Mr. Justice Jackson pointed out that the rights that these children wanted to assert refusal to go through the ceremony, did not affect the rights of any other person on Earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.661" offset="7426988">That is something which pertained to them only and the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.920" offset="7444125">His exact words, the freedom asserted by these appellees, does not bring them into collision with rights asserted by any other individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.284" offset="7477561">It is such conflicts which most frequently require intervention of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.903" offset="7496056">But the refusal of those persons to participate in the ceremony does not interfere with or deny rights of others to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.629" offset="7522910">The sole conflict, Mr. Justice Jackson said, is between authority and the rights of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.876" offset="7543912">And so here, Your Honors, the sole conflict is between naked authority and the rights of a married couple to live a normal married life and express their mutual love and affection to each other in a way that couples have done from time immemorial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.281" offset="7773477">Indeed it is a possible one because as almost everyone knows now, most of the Protestant denominations have come out not only improving artificial birth controls, the World Conference of Churches did so last summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.269" offset="7833454">The National Council of Churches did so last week, approving of artificial birth control and taking the position that it is the moral responsibility of children -- the moral -- the moral responsibility of parents to be responsible in the number and spacing of their children, taking into consideration by many things such as the health of the mother and health of future children and the economic and social environment of the couple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.049" offset="7948601">Now, actually, there is a conflict, as everyone knows, between the position taken by the majority of the Protestant and Jewish denominations and the position taken by the Roman Catholic Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.630" offset="8010877">This is our conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.160" offset="8021013">But as so often happens, when a reasonable man came far up to the areas of actual agreement, the dispute that is left becomes less important and ranker tends to disappear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.167" offset="8117039">There is no important denomination that I know of in the western world which takes the position that absolute control of conception under and all circumstances is wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.726" offset="8199272">Now, the difference comes to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.715" offset="8211289">The Protestant denominations take the position that contraception, by the most effective means, contraception is a personal matter, a matter of individual choice, to put it in terms of National Council of Churches before God in prayer, something individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.522" offset="8294463">The Catholic Church takes the position that -- well, members of the faith are required to follow the teachings of the Church which does not, in unqualified terms, prevent the control of conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.646" offset="8354962">That while members of the faith should follow the teachings of the Church, there are very loud and vigorous spokesmen today by Catholic scholars and members of the Catholic hierarchy who take the position that it is immoral and it would be immoral for either group to force by compulsion of law is for use upon the other group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.958" offset="8436255">In that, Your Honors, I think this is dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.183" offset="8449108">It's very difficult, Your Honors, to claim reasonable for a law, which so many thoughtful men regard as immoral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.435" offset="8490172">Now, insofar as there are supposedly advantages to this law, so far as the State is concerned, I should like to point out that there are practically none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.839" offset="8535730">So far as the purpose of the law is concerned, the only clue we have from the legislative history is that it had something to do with obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.511" offset="8566450">Because the law was enacted in 1879 as a part of the crusade against lewdness and obscenity, a part of the Comstock and (Inaudible) legislation, but now, to come along ways so far to use Mr. Justice Brennan's phrase, so far as contemporary community standards are concerned, you come a long way since the Victorian prudery of 1879.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.484" offset="8670312">Contraception is no longer a dirty word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.941" offset="8684210">Now, so far as the Court's concerned, the only suggested purpose of the law is to avoid immorality, namely, licentious sexual relations, presumably between unmarried persons, fornication, possibly adultery occasionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.408" offset="8741992">Now, that is mentioned in two of the opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.794" offset="8751606">The purpose of the law is to promote morals by preventing sexual intercourse between unmarried persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.861" offset="8779818">Now, the law does not accomplish this purpose and it cannot accomplish it for the simple reason that it is not unlawful in Connecticut for a person to use a contraceptive device for the purpose of preventing disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.074" offset="8840735">The Court has cited Commonwealth against Corbett and Commonwealth versus Rolinski, the Massachusetts case which so decided, under their law, with the parent approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.296" offset="8877620">And there is cited in our brief, a ruling by the Commissioner of Drugs, a formal ruling in a letter to the Bridgeport Pharmaceutical Association which asked the question, is it lawful for us to sell, when the advice of the -- prescription of a physician a vaginal diaphragm?</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.278" offset="8941464">And the Commissioner of Drugs made the formal ruling saying, "Yes, it has therapeutic purposes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.572" offset="8962675">In other words for the purpose of preventing disease or other therapeutic purposes, it is perfectly alright to sell the most effective contraceptive device in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.178" offset="8997157">Therefore, it's clearly impossible for this law to achieve its ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.438" offset="9018159">Now then, let us assume for the sake of argument that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.724" offset="9039266">It is submitted that the opinions of this Court which are completely dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.119" offset="9072912">In Butler versus Michigan, this Court struck down a law prohibiting the sale of magazine pictures and other types of literature tending to corrupt the morals of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.475" offset="9122335">They struck it down because the law also prevented the sale of such literature to adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.885" offset="9147935">Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his opinion in that case for this Court said, "Law goes too far."</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.531" offset="9170505">It reduces the reading matter for the adult public of Michigan to the level of that which is fit for children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.507" offset="9194433">Not only in -- not only in -- in the Butler case, but more recently, Mr. Justice Stewart in the Shelton case, Shelton versus Tucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.604" offset="9230796">Decided this term in discussing the listing of organizations required by the Arkansas statute made the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.588" offset="9262770">The statute, he said, requires the person to list without number, every conceivable kind of associational tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.440" offset="9298192">Many such relationships could have no possible bearing upon the teacher's occupational competence or fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.159" offset="9321075">The end, he held, could be more narrowly achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.864" offset="9335808">Now, what does this law do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.251" offset="9345421">This law, in order to prevent fornication, perhaps in occasional case of adultery, prevents a woman who is likely to die with another pregnancy from following standard medical advice in obtaining standard medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.049" offset="9400592">In addition, this law prevents married couples, every married couple in Connecticut are deprived the right of sexual intercourse if, for any reason, if for any reason, the health of mother or the welfare of the children might be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.832" offset="9475720">Certainly, this is to burn down the house to roast the pig, throwing a baby out for the dishwater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.401" offset="9506022">The end could be, could obviously be achieved by much lesser means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.431" offset="9530159">So, Your Honor, it's suggested that Butler versus Michigan and the cases following it, could be dispositive of this case on an area ground I met but it couldn't be dispositive of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.366" offset="9573836">Now, Your Honors, we have undertaken the burden or said we're willing to undertake the burden of demonstrating upon the disadvantages when the threat to life and personal freedom and individual liberty are weighed against the so-called advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.047" offset="9640605">There's no reasonable basis for these laws at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.127" offset="9652935">Now, the evils of abstinence have been pointed out from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.556" offset="9682610">It has been said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.128" offset="9688879">Floyd, I quoted in the brief, has said many years ago that one's sexual passions have been aroused, in connection with the particular person, they are not to be stilled and if the normal outlet is stifled, they will found an -- find an outlet elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.704" offset="9759201">Therefore, to doom young people, such as the Poes and the Does, to abstinence is to invite more harm than it could possibly be avoided by the contraceptive statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.522" offset="9806535">Moreover, in the brief, we have cited a number of cases in which abortions are the result of unwanted children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.080" offset="9852719">Abortions are the result of children who're not wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.999" offset="9864422">And that they there show that most of the abortions performed, as a matter of fact, there is a medical -- in British Medical Journal, there's an article cited in the brief indicating that 90% to 95% of the abortion performed in England are illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.216" offset="9921264">And the opinions of the best experts in this country are to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.702" offset="9939237">Most abortions are illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.525" offset="9946446">As a matter of fact, the data indicated that there are relatively few operations admitted to the Presbyterian-Columbia Hospital and the Bellevue Hospital in New York, for illegal abortions, although there are hundreds of women who were brought in for post abortion care, as a result of illegal abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.821" offset="10019694">Now, it also happens, that the data show, that most -- these are also cited in the brief, most abortions are performed upon married women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.854" offset="10059818">It isn't solely a matter of a young woman finding herself unmarried and pregnant who are the victims of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.493" offset="10086358">Most abortions are upon married women who do not want a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.561" offset="10102659">In psychiatric evidence also cited in the brief indicates quite clearly, quite clearly that the unwanted child is one of the most unfortunate of human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.290" offset="10145604">As Dr. Manager said, "Sometimes the unwanted child will stimulate a certain amount of love and affection in the parents plus their feeling of guilt not wanting a child."</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.085" offset="10188758">But he says the parents may fool themselves and they may fool others but they can never fool the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.727" offset="10215299">You will go through life always knowing and feeling unverbalized, though it maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.139" offset="10236928">He knows that somehow he was unwanted and any becomes a victim of all the prejudices, racial, social and otherwise that plagued this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.179" offset="10285098">Now, Your Honors, I should like to ask my colleague, Mrs. Pilpel to stress some points which I have not been able to reach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2575.763" offset="10407455">I have the feeling that so far as I know it has never been enforced against a person who used a contraceptive for rather obvious reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.672" offset="10447057">Police do not peek into people's bedrooms to see whether they're using contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.801" offset="10471612">And people do not go into a drugstore and ask for a box of condoms with the statement that I'm going to use these to prevent conception rather than prevent disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.489" offset="10510378">And so actually, I know -- know a prosecution of an individual for use.</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.419" offset="10546113">And this I do know that since Nelson versus State, there has been in Connecticut, no public or private clinic for the purpose of advising on contraceptions.</text>

            <label>Ms. Harriet Pilpel</label>
            <text syncTime="2686.799" offset="10851641">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.642" offset="10858956">There are many questions of death and disease to which the medical profession does not know the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.777" offset="10891452">However, these cases present situations where the medical profession in the person of Dr. Buxton does know the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.900" offset="10931994">However, he is not permitted by the laws of the State of Connecticut to give the answer which the State and the State Supreme Court can see, as medically speaking, the best and safest preventive measure for the plaintiffs to follow in order to avoid pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.545" offset="11014541">If Connecticut had passed a statute forbidding women for whom a pregnancy was counter indicated from -- from having sex relations, we submit that this would be a highly unreasonable enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.863" offset="11083818">Yet that is precisely the effect of what Connecticut has done in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.743" offset="11107328">In each of these cases, Connecticut has imposed a choice upon the appellant Mrs. Doe either to risk death or renounced all marital relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.121" offset="11156856">Mrs. Poe, to produce -- Mr. and Mrs. Poe to produce more monstrous babies incapable of survival were to renounce all marital relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.687" offset="11199175">And Dr. Buxton perhaps the most difficult choice of all, namely, a choice between what he concedes to be his professional obligations, which I will show in a moment, is the overwhelming consensus of medical opinion and the law of the State where he practice his medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.461" offset="11270228">Surely, any approach to this problem in these cases is as Professor Harper has said, "To burn down the house to roast the pig" and especially so, since there are our aspects of these cases touching upon freedom of expression and freedom of religious worship which tie in to the untroubled unreasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.235" offset="11357372">The State has not attempted to justify these drastic effects on the appellants beyond making generalizations about the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.816" offset="11399690">And that this Court has said in an earlier case's term, generalities expressing the State's unrestricted power do not help to resolve constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.319" offset="11445666">It is my hope to show that the overwhelming consensus of medical opinions supports Dr. Buxton's claim and the admission of the appellees and the finding of the state court that the prescription of contraceptives in these cases is medically demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.804" offset="11519645">We submit further that this Court has always accorded great weight to medical opinion in medical matters where that opinion is, as here, substantially unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.237" offset="11569382">We also submit that traditionally, neither this Court, nor the other courts to whom the question has come up for decision, have conceived that general prohibitions, constitutionally apply to medical practice backed by substantial consensus of medical opinion, as Professor Harper indicated that Connecticut then is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.802" offset="11667602">It is furthermore totally out of line with all federal and state legislative, judicial and administrative experience in this field with the possible exception of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.832" offset="11715772">And it is also totally out of line with the balance of Connecticut's own statutory scheme touching on the general subject of procreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.717" offset="11755269">In other words, that virtually every guard close this Court looks at in due process cases, points toward the invalidity of these statutes as applied to these appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.660" offset="11806992">Dr. Buxton's opinion is amply confirmed by all the data available with reference to the opinion of the medical profession as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.194" offset="11849206">The American Medical Association, several of its constituent sections including the section on obstetrics and gynecology, which is the section here involved and the section on mental and nervous diseases, other important national societies like the American Gynecological Society and the American Neurological Association and the American Health -- Public Health Association, medical societies of various States including the Medical Society of the State of Connecticut, all are in accord that in this type of case, contraception, meaning the prescription of drugs, medicinal articles or instruments for the prevention of conception, is generally recognized as a necessary and proper part of medical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.679" offset="12043139">This fact is further attested too by the authority cited in our and the appellants' brief and by the brief filed in this case by Mr. Whitney North Seymour on behalf of the heads of the department of obstetrics and gynecology in 66 of the 79 leading nonreligious medical schools in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.685" offset="12135090">This Court, in a long line of cases, has upheld laws, which like this one, are affected with the medical interest, where it was shown that such laws were supported by a consensus of medical opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.775" offset="12199455">In almost all of these cases, the Court plainly implied that if the consensus were the other way, those enactments could not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.795" offset="12243550">Several of these cases are cited and discussed in our and in the appellants' briefs, among them the (Inaudible) Lambert against Yellowley and Jacobson cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.849" offset="12283779">I should like also to call the attention of this Court to an additional case, namely, Price against Illinois, decided by this Court in 1915, where Mr. Justice Hughes said in connection with the claim that a statute prohibiting the use of boric acid as a food preservative was unconstitutional that that contention "could be granted only if it appeared that by a consensus of opinions, the preservative was unquestionably harmless".</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.171" offset="12413032">In our cases, the devices are not only unquestionably harmless, but they are also conceded to be the best and safest preventive measures necessary for the protection of Mrs. Doe and the Poes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.843" offset="12519717">In the January 9th, 1961 issue of the New England Medical Journal, which was published after the brief in this case was filed, now, which is one of the nation's leading medical journals, the editorial right have carried the Connecticut decision here under review to its logical, and it seems to me, necessary conclusion if the decision stands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.930" offset="12856069">Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, actually, some of the authorities, which we cite in our brief, show that there was a considerable amount of medical opinion at that time and that it may have been not any way near as clear as it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.819" offset="12911658">But in -- for example, Mr. Glanville Williams' book on the Criminal Law and the Sanctity of Life, he points out that the medical profession at that time would have been in favor of the use of contraceptives, but whatever doubt might have existed, has certainly been resolved by the medical profession since and today, the situation is substantially unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.548" offset="13002564">As far back as just 11 years or in the 21 years later than 1879, in 1900, this Court in Austin against Tennessee, a liquor regulation case said that "if the legislative body comes to the conclusion that a due regard for public safety and morals requires a suppression of the liquor traffic, there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent its doing so".</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.954" offset="13104232">But then it went on to say, "While perhaps, it may not wholly prohibit the use or sale of them for medicinal purposes, it may hedge about their use as a general beverage, such restriction as it pleases," and he added, "nor can we deny to the legislature the power to impose restrictions on the sale of noxious or poisonous drugs, such as opium and other similar articles extremely valuable as medicines, but equally harmful to the habitual user."</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.407" offset="13230038">This statute does not recognize any such distinction which has uniformly been recognized by legislatures and courts including this Court with reference to almost every prohibition of liquor, narcotics, drugs or other so-called noxious article.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.973" offset="13300255">We haven't unable to find a single case other than these -- these cases and the Massachusetts cases where a general legislative prohibition has been applied to the severe detriment of individual patients in a manner directly contradictory to the overwhelming consensus of medical opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.279" offset="13385519">It should be noted that underlying the decision of lower courts, accepting medical practice from general prohibition, is obviously the belief that if they applied against the consensus of medical opinion, they might well be unconstitutional, so that a number of these cases, although they involved questions of statutory construction, were obviously resolved in terms of avoiding serious constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.689" offset="13503175">This Court has made very clear that, for example, in the Sweezy case, the teachers and students must always remain free to inquire, to study, to evaluate, to gain new material in understanding, otherwise our civilization will stagnate and die.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.561" offset="13570675">As it's pointed out in the amicus brief filed by Mr. Whitney North Seymour for the heads of the medical schools, he points out that it would be ironic indeed if the freedom to conquer new frontiers in medicine were jealously guarded, but the duty of physicians to give the public the benefit for such conquest would've be subject to legislative whims, which is what these statutes come down to in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.578" offset="13666701">In other words, the doctors, although they are free to learn and to teach, are not free to practice what they teach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.941" offset="13708184">Now, as we have said before, the Connecticut law on the use of contraceptives is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.727" offset="13727305">No other law has an impact on use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.556" offset="13738590">No other law prohibits use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.853" offset="13747785">They are unique, secondly, because most statutes in the field of contraception are not prohibitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.160" offset="13773072">They are regulatory as the breakdown and analysis of the state statutes in our brief demonstrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.787" offset="13803583">Even in the case of prohibitions which are absolute in their words, on their face as for example is the case of the federal statutes on this subject and some of the state statutes, the courts have interpreted these prohibitions not to apply the cases of medical necessity such as we have here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.851" offset="13883831">For example, Judge Augustus Hand in the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in United States against One Package said that notwithstanding the wording of the federal statute, he could not believe and the Court held with him that things "which might intelligently be employed by conscientious and competent positions for the purpose of saving life or promoting the well-being of their patients could be prohibited especially since."</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.952" offset="13988216">And I quote again, "In many cases, this is advocated by such a weight of authority in the medical world."</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.636" offset="14014966">Now, speaking of contraceptive services that same court through Judge Learned Hand had earlier said in considering whether or not, a contraceptive clinic was a health service, that he could see no difference that this is confined to married women who were not to have children both for their own and their children's sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.324" offset="14105663">He pointed out that health is as much at stake as all -- as though it attempted the general prevention of sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.661" offset="14131054">And he added, "Nor does it matter that there are those who thinks the cure, worse than the disease.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.934" offset="14488095">It is interesting to note that the New York Times of January 19th, 1961 reported a study to determine whether the pill also had the effect of preventing cancer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.803" offset="14539609">The article stated that cervical and breast cancer appeared to be unusually infrequent among women taking the pill to prevent pregnancy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3702.612" offset="14914832">He probably would at least have had be to aware -- make the patient aware of their existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3885.724" offset="15647305">It seems unreasonable to suppose that the national scheme in this instance, the Connecticut scheme of legislation, involve such inconsistencies and requires the complete suppression of articles, the use of which in many cases is advocated by such a weight of authority in the medical world."</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.368" offset="15721911">It is, we submit, equally unreasonable to construe the Connecticut statute in this manner, in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3937.518" offset="15854508">Not only is the Connecticut statute unique, but virtually all religious groups in this country endure some method of contraception, some method of contraception in cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.737" offset="15903305">While the Protestants and most of the Jewish denominations sanction all medically approved method of contraception, there are two religious groups who differed from the rest in this regard as to permissible methods and dissent on certain methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.172" offset="15961088">These are the Orthodox Jews and the Roman Catholics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.871" offset="15979896">The Orthodox Jewish rabbis, speaking in a resolution of their rabbinical alliance, point out that Orthodox Judaism does not condone any artificial birth control measured by the male spouse in any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.384" offset="16037888">Only in cases where the health of the female is jeopardized, certain birth control measure is allowed and then only through a direct consultation between the medical and rabbinical authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.424" offset="16090133">Thus, both the Roman Catholics and the Orthodox Jews approves the use of certain contraceptive methods as a matter of religious faith and of course, those groups have a right to refrain from using these methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.754" offset="16139452">That -- it is a matter of religious faith appears fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.577" offset="16154708">For example, the code of Catholic hospitals says their operations, treatments and devices designed to render conception impossible are morally objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.630" offset="16202877">Whereas, therefore, these religious groups have the right to refrain from endorsing of -- in fact can go so far as to prohibit the members of those groups from using certain methods of contraception.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond J. Cannon</label>
            <text syncTime="4444.325" offset="17881715">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.300" offset="17901568">To further extend the review of this situation, it's been pointed out the Act was passed in 1879.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.765" offset="17939498">And since then, it has been maintained on the books and enacted by and reenacted by legislature when they have adopted various provisions of the statute since that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.544" offset="17994564">When these cases first were brought to my attention, it seemed to me that the problem had been conclusively resolved by the cases of State versus Nelson decided in 1940 and Tileston versus Ullman in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.047" offset="18068543">Both of those cases, and particularly the Nelson case, I believe, prevented or presented situations exactly as they appear here on the claims of Poe and Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.086" offset="18132699">The court -- our Supreme Court of Errors also indicated in the Nelson case the fact that, and discussed it at some length, that since 1923, there have been periodical attempts to have this law changed or modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.022" offset="18212530">And that every session of the legislature which meets two years -- every two years since 1923 up to and through as pointed out in the decision in the present cases, there has been bills presented of varying types before the legislature, some requesting repeal of the statute or modification of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.883" offset="18307929">There have been any number of statutes and these are indicated in the notes and the decision of the Supreme Court and contained in the record in the Poe and Ullman case in the opinion filed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.142" offset="18368951">Now, I guess no one can argue that the legislature doesn't have the right to enact statutes which pertain to the field of moral.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.889" offset="18443975">In the Nelson case, the Court indicated that this did involve public morals and because of that fact, they felt that even though it might have restricted the use of contraceptives in some instances, nevertheless, if that be deemed liberty which these people were entitled to have, the legislature, nevertheless, acting for the general good, had the right to make it -- the prohibition absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.637" offset="18606979">This also has been a very controversial problem in Connecticut, but that's been indicated at all the sessions and all the hearings that had before the legislature over the period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.491" offset="18670404">I might point out that in Connecticut, the House of Representatives -- there are two from each town, they're elected territorially, two from each town having a population of 5000 or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.323" offset="18733725">So, a town with 5500 people could have two representatives in the State of Connecticut, whereas the City of Hartford has 180,000 people still has two, but the Senators are elected on the population basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.881" offset="18803942">Most of these bills have been turned down in the Senate of the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.419" offset="18826094">And the problems which are here today presented have been presented to the legislature, the medical problems, the public health problems and the fact that -- and the religious problems, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.872" offset="18919926">Now -- the religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.635" offset="18938943">Under their briefs, as I read them, submitted, it seemed to me that they were arguing that these laws did in fact represent the minority view of the Connecticut people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.624" offset="18998920">Our Supreme Court said that after all these attempts, obviously, would seem to be to represent the will of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.883" offset="19071958">There are factors now present before the present session of legislature, another bill to modify this legislation, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.807" offset="19115635">Justice Learned Hand, in discussing a similar case involving some -- of the One Package case, he said people's minds change in relation to these subjects or use of contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.854" offset="19167775">And the statute that they were discussing at that time was also -- no statute past in neighborhood of 1879.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.610" offset="19210825">But in that case he said, "The statute now forbids the same conduct that it prohibited when originally enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.313" offset="19265682">It takes time for people to a public opinion, to jell, to get enough force behind it, to cause their changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.232" offset="19305284">It is our view that most of the arguments that are presented here are sociological or physiological, that they should belong in -- in proper places before the legislature, not before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5304.265" offset="21321415">The Connecticut Medical Society has a committee to investigate all maternal deaths and they filed a five-year report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.005" offset="21364464">The last report which they filed covered the years 1951 through 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.278" offset="21389542">And that five-year period, there were 75 maternal deaths in Connecticut with all thousands of children that were born.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.049" offset="21428621">They go further than that, this committee of the Medical Society in the State of Connecticut, they say out that -- out of those 75%, 65% could have been avoided, had the patient had proper medical care or had the patient had taken care of herself and followed doctor's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.482" offset="21518273">Even Dr. Guttmacher, who is chairman of the medical section of the Plan Federation of America, I believe it was in August, I also mentioned this in the brief that in August of 1960, Dr. Guttmacher was featured in an article which advocated a relaxation and an extension of the abortion laws in the various States in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.627" offset="21638855">And he said there, "Because of that article," that was a quotation, in view of the advancements made by medical profession in the last 20 years, "it is now very -- very rare to require or have an abortion on a mother because of a serious heart, lung or kidney disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.695" offset="21751181">It is a very, very rare situation today."</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.318" offset="21769676">The doctors and the doctors in Connecticut probably -- this statute may or may not have had something to do with it, but the fact is that when they are confronted with situations like this and they know the wishes and wants of people, that progress is made and the doctor who filed that report said that Connecticut, I think it ranked about 15 or a 5-year period in proportion to the number of deaths in the State, but they are fast, quickly in reaching irreducible minimum of maternal deaths of -- in the State of Connecticut.</text>
