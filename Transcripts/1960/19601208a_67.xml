            <text syncTime="157.297" offset="733581">I have tried to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.187" offset="741104">In the United States, I think they professed to have about a million.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.389" offset="757927">I have some information in my brief on that too, although there is no exact computation made.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.903" offset="784050">As a matter of information, I think most of the Jewish groups objected to inclusion of such a question in a critical sentence I just mention that passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.389" offset="825950">We assert that there has been a violation on a kind of this statute of the First Amendment on two separate grounds, of course, a violation of the Free Exercise Clause and a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.479" offset="874329">So far as the Free Exercise Clause is concerned it is our position that this kind of a statute puts to these kinds of appellants a very clear choice and this choice is in essence admitted by all parties to the specific proceedings, the choice of going out of business or at least giving up a very substantial amount of their income or giving up their faith or at least, very substantially compromising their faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.160" offset="1001075">This Court has said in Schneider versus New Jersey and Thornhill versus Alabama and in many cases, that when a party litigant walks into court complaining of an alleged abridgement of a First Amendment freedom, it is up to the court to a -- to be -- stood to examine the effect of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.862" offset="1075890">And we submit that the effect of this legislation is to leave the Orthodox Jewish retailer and the Seventh Day Adventist and Baptist retailers without one hour of weekend time within which to conduct his retail trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.515" offset="1146420">The effect of this statute is to put to these people the choice I mentioned a moment ago and they are the only group in society which now must face that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.253" offset="1189366">We say therefore that the First Amendment is very much involved in this case, the Free Exercise Clause is, that by virtue of this statute, the economic loss which these people will admittedly suffer and it is a serious one, becomes an instrument of com -- compulsion to give up or compromise their religious faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.310" offset="1285601">And for that reason, the clear and present danger test or test by similar names is applicable to this kind of litigation and the scope of this Court's judicial inquiry must be correspondingly much wider.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.867" offset="1359893">We go further and say that there are other reasons and this comes really to a question Justice Frankfurter asked a few moments ago of Mr. Ehrmann, we go further and say there are other reasons why the scope of this Court's independent inquiry must be broad in this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.550" offset="1430632">I can't refrain from mentioning the fact that somehow if Pennsylvanians were more evenly split on this religious question of which day of the week is holy.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.089" offset="1472742">In other words, if -- if half of Pennsylvanians were Sabbatarians and the other half, Sunday observers that quite obviously, this kind of legislation would not be here before this Court today, it wouldn't pass and -- and this would be so for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.151" offset="1524987">First of all, because it would much more dramatically appear than it even does now as an obvious civil interference into a controversy which is basically religious and probably, more importantly because -- for political reasons, such legislation would not pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.663" offset="1587054">I think it is fair to say that it is the numerical insignificance of the Sabbatarian groups, Orthodox Jews, Adventists and Baptists which accounts for this type of legislation being before this Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="741.313" offset="3069659">As a matter of fact, the proponents of this legislation say a lot of things and I want to get to this point right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.523" offset="3094528">They admit that there is preferential aid with this kind of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.636" offset="3118979">They merely say that it wasn't intended if it -- that it's not the primary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.673" offset="3135070">They say the primary purpose, the only purpose is a civil purpose and if this kind of law preferentially not just the common -- not just by an accommodation but preferentially aids the majority Christian group.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.633" offset="3186897">Well, this is merely an incidental accidental byproduct, so to speak, of otherwise valid civil legislation and so it's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.212" offset="3217199">They go further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.769" offset="3223468">They admit that this kind of legislation specifically hurts the Sabbatarian groups and very seriously so, but they say that if this is so, this too is not the intention of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.612" offset="3282819">It is merely an accidental byproduct of this valid secular legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.915" offset="3300059">So they admit really both the preferential aid and the interference but they plead that it's by accident and the appellants, I submit, cannot afford these kinds of accidents, Sabbatarians cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.989" offset="3344363">I think the maxim -- the old legal maxim is applicable to this kind of case that legislators must be deemed to have intended the natural and foreseeable consequences of their Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.841" offset="3383756">I submit that constitutionality cannot turn on the question of motive and intent that a legislature cannot avoid the specific proscriptions of the First Amendment by simply saying, "But we didn't mean it."</text>
            <text syncTime="833.915" offset="3440076">If legislatures know what the result of legislation will be and if they know that it's going to preferentially aid one group and in addition to that, interfered substantially with another group then they shouldn't pass such legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.912" offset="3504024">And if they -- if there are compelling reasons for passing such legislation and I submit there are not, but if there were then they most certainly cannot pass such legislation without doing everything they can to minimize the effect upon those groups upon whom the legislation worked in a special handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.464" offset="3590228">I have argued in my brief also that the fact that this is preferential aid to the majority Christian group as against the minority Christian group and Orthodox Judaism, hurts the Sabbatarian groups, not only the individual practitioner of the religion but hurts the groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.053" offset="3652608">We're living in a society where, according to the Zorach decision of this Court, we have a certain free competition between sects.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.384" offset="3685940">And it is the law of that case that the Government must be neutral when it comes to this competition between sects.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.626" offset="3718855">This case goes far beyond the Zorach case which did permit under certain very limited circumscribed circumstances, accommodation, so to speak, of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.423" offset="3766084">This case goes very far beyond that because there, at least there was an accommodation for all.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.180" offset="3793147">Here, we have an accommodation for some and therefore, we have preferential aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.601" offset="3814776">And once this Court transcends the limit of strict separation of church and state, which I don't believe it should do or should have done, certain problems inevitably arise with regard to this doctrine of accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.255" offset="3873395">Certain problems arise because with preferential aid, you have a tremendous disadvantage between sects who are supposed to in a free society be competing freely with one another for new members and for maintaining their adherence.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.374" offset="3941940">I would like to speak for a moment, if I may, with regard to the question of reasonable alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.670" offset="3979034">This Court has said that mere legislative preference for one rather than other means of combating substance to the evil is not enough to justify legislation which interferes with the rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.554" offset="4034623">In discussing other alternatives and some of these questions have already come up in the preceding case, in discussing alternatives, we have to start with the proposition of -- well, what -- what is the legislative end in mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="998.881" offset="4099929">Now if the legislative hand in mind is a weekly respite from laborers, for all Pennsylvania citizens then as has been said, a one-day-in-seven statute does that exactly and it does it efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.043" offset="4156562">The only objection to it that I have heard is that it is allegedly difficult to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.360" offset="4189790">And I submit, even if that was so which it is not, that is not a sufficient reason for passing other legislation to inter -- which interferes with First Amendment freedoms just as in the Schneider case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.608" offset="4238796">If the purpose of Government is to keep the streets clean, they may pass an anti litter ordinance, but may they pass a law which forbids the distribution of handbills, First Amendment freedoms are involved, they don't have that choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.536" offset="4906590">After all, it is the -- it is the Sunday Blue Law legislation, not the one day in seventh legislation which has a long history, almost a tradition of sporadic enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.510" offset="4954446">Besides which as has been pointed out in one of the briefs, I believe it was a -- a Civil Liberties Union brief in the next succeeding case, two Guys from Harrison, there are specific ways set forth in the statutes of those states, one day -- which have one day in seven laws of satisfactorily enforcing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.195" offset="5025186">So that it is my position that there is no need for a law to go beyond one day in seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.694" offset="5063220">However, it is -- the position is taken that a weekly respite from labor is not the only legitimate end of this kind of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.569" offset="5094672">That it's important for some reason that number one, a man who has a day off from work should have a tranquil community in which to enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.009" offset="5124451">It is important it is said that husbands and wives and children all be home at the same time so that they can enjoy their day of rest together and it is said that this can't be accomplished under a one day in seven law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.961" offset="5176278">I doubt that very much, but basically, and the question as I see it as related to this case, is let's assume the legitimacy of those ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.992" offset="5212327">To what degree is it necessary to enforce the law against the Sabbatarian retailer in order to accomplish those ends?</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.079" offset="5248690">After all, there are more than a dozen statues in the United States which -- like -- like the Pennsylvania statute which contain specific exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.270" offset="5285470">And no one in any of these cases before Your Honors this morning has pointed to one such state and said that it -- those exemptions have not worked out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.283" offset="5329565">That on account of the Sunday operations pursuant to such exemptions, family life has been in tranquil or that a man can't enjoy his day of community repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.787" offset="5379511">So that even if those ends were legitimate, and I submit that they are not, there's not evidence in this case even though a very long history of legislation specifically permitting Sunday operations that it is necessary to enforce this kind of law against these kinds of people.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="2026.063" offset="8208677">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Honorable members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.095" offset="8224768">I think the last question of the Chief Justice pretty well epitomizes the present question now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.394" offset="8257996">There is no aid as a result of the particular rule which the Chief Justice referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.785" offset="8287566">It does not establish a religion and in my judgment, it does not prohibit the free exercise thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.088" offset="8324765">And I think that when we come to analyze this particular statute before the Court, we will see that any harm, economic or otherwise which flows to the Mohammedan trial lawyer, is one which is in direct, not immediate, consequential and I would say, personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.679" offset="8399161">And one which is not, on the other hand, direct, immediate and universally applicable to all Mohammedans but I will develop that in the course of my presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.592" offset="8446809">I think it's important in this case especially because in the -- like the argument yesterday on the Massachusetts law, we -- it appeared to me that we are dealing here with substantially different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.997" offset="8500412">As Mr. Mann pointed out, the only law here before Your Honors at this moment, is the Act of 1959 of the Pennsylvania legislature which appears in full at page 17 of this raw transcript of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.267" offset="8561434">And I would hope that Your Honors would be good enough to refer to that because it is only by referring to this Act and knowing precisely what we are here considering, will we be able to reach what I hope would be the proper decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.024" offset="8624441">This Act, you will note, is not a general law, it's not a day of rest statute and it is -- if anything, a day off statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.313" offset="8649624">And in my judgment, this is not a First Amendment case at all and no number of repetitions of the phrase "First Amendment," or the basic rules with which all of us are familiar will make it a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.754" offset="8739380">If you'll read the statute, you will see as I do that all it does, and that's all that these plaintiffs are complaining about this Act, no other Act, they want an injunction to restrain us from forcing this Act, is to amend a general penal code of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.401" offset="8801970">This doesn't go back to 1682.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.500" offset="8814404">No ancient observance of any religious right is here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.539" offset="8838541">This is a 1959 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.389" offset="8849930">The pressures behind what are so fresh in our minds that we can tell you that religion had absolutely nothing to do with its passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.438" offset="8886188">What does it do? It penalizes the sale at retail of only certain items or commodities and it penalizes these sales very heavily unlike other statutes of Pennsylvania which are not here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.017" offset="8956510">Now, why was it passed?</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.225" offset="8965287">It was passed for sociological and economic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.861" offset="8979811">As the briefs of the Retail Clerks pointed out, the retail industry is the second largest in the United States in terms of numbers employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.052" offset="9028608">This is an industry where unless you have a uniform mandatory day off, Your Honors, the people who work in that industry, the individual entrepreneurs are just not going to get a day off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.749" offset="9095377">The competition in this kind of industry has been aptly described as atomistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.950" offset="9120246">It is -- there is no measure of control over the market in the sense that if a groups of entrepreneurs should take Sunday off for example, that this would cause competitors to do likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.788" offset="9175521">On the contrary, what happens is that the competition is so atomized here that it works like a chain reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.529" offset="9210525">If one retailer keeps open on Sunday, this essentially triggers off a series of other retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.060" offset="9240618">Now the Retail Clerks pointed out and I think quite correctly, that the employees in this industry are not completely unionized and that's certainly an understatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.670" offset="9283041">We know that actually, it -- it is hardly unionized, but they say that even with regard of the segment of that industry which is unionized that there is no way for them to get Sunday as a day off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.896" offset="9339988">Moreover, they point out that the – bulk of the employees were not unionized, have virtually no bargaining power with their employers and hence, they can't even get a day off, much less a common or uniform day off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.037" offset="9424520">And as far as I'm concerned this Act was standard for -- as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.146" offset="9445000">We have no exceptions here but it is applicable to a reasonable and in my judgment, large class of employees and individual entrepreneurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.771" offset="9491498">Now, the retail merchants at the state level, at the national level have filed briefs and they too point out the essential need for a common day off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.711" offset="9539250">Now, we don't say this is a day of rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.186" offset="9549176">That if Your Honors will look at this, the -- You Honors will agree with me that they find small Orthodox Jewish merchants who are the plaintiffs in this case, are not in any way penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.617" offset="9602884">If they'd go to their stores and they do all of the things which must be done in the conducting of a retail business such as taking inventory, fixing displays, having sales meetings, making their plans for the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.208" offset="9669235">I know as an Orthodox Jew that this violates the strict Sabbatarian obligation of the Orthodox Jews.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.597" offset="9702776">They cannot do that on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.207" offset="9709255">They may not do that from Friday sundown to Saturday night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.165" offset="9729108">But they are permitted to do these things under this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.636" offset="9750946">The one thing they may not do is, sell to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.705" offset="9767246">Now, the reason for that are the reasons, sociological reasons which I have mentioned, the economic loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.360" offset="9789816">There is a further economic reason which is of great importance in the passage of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.529" offset="9818551">Pennsylvania, as so many of our large industrial states, has a problem of -- which is essentially concerned with an imbalance between the large cities and the core areas of our large cities and the suburban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.098" offset="9884797">In Philadelphia for example, a large part of our wealth is concentrated in the large department stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.081" offset="9916771">We know and the Court certainly can take judicial notice to this fact that there has been a flight to the suburbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.296" offset="9945610">You will have -- developed in the 1950s, 1950s as tendency to get away from the big department store, John Wanamaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.167" offset="9981032">John Wanamaker deteriorates the extent that we have a fragmentation with the -- all kinds of suburban shopping centers taking over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.671" offset="10019067">The City of Philadelphia is in a very sad position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.576" offset="10034740">Now, we are now taking positive steps to remedy that and the legislature had before it, not merely the flight of Philadelphia but Pittsburg, Allentown and in the next case, you'll see it, Your Honors, there's no question or religion involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.987" offset="10096389">Two Guys from Harrison, you've got that problem there as to whether or not the legislature had a right or power, and that's always before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.544" offset="10134528">Was it legitimately within the legislative power of Pennsylvania to say that with respect to this group of items and this group of retail sellers that there would be a substantial penalty if they did the -- this on Sunday where as Judge Hasty pointed out when he dismissed the appeal, the challenge to the constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.688" offset="10227106">These are the very items which the suburban discount houses were selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.705" offset="10247168">These are the very items which triggered off these Sunday sales and which caused the various employees in the retail business not to get Sunday off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.337" offset="10293770">Now, why do they want Sunday off is the answer also in the brief of the Retail Clerks and also of the Merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.321" offset="10325640">They say that Sunday has become a nonreligious day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.752" offset="10347374">It has a unique significance in America today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.373" offset="10361898">Now, I could concede that in the early days, colonial days, the Sunday laws may have been passed for that -- for the religious purposes but that's irrelevant to the consideration of the constitutionality of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.698" offset="10415188">In 1959 when this law was passed in Pennsylvania and I dare say all over the United States, Sunday had attained an unusual significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.394" offset="10469940">It was the day when the great football games were played, professional football games.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.656" offset="10491047">It was a day when you saw “Face the Nation” on the television, and the other great television programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.080" offset="10516752">It was the day when most people wanted to go to the beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.626" offset="10530858">It is the day when the municipal and private golf courses are swarming with doffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.108" offset="10552801">It is a -- it's a day which some ministers have contended has become completely nonreligious and indeed we have even had complaints from some who say that the result of a statute will be to interfere with religion because you're giving day off and this is -- together with their family will result in their engaging in completely nonreligious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.920" offset="10644125">If we need, and I certainly don't want to labor this point but if we need any further demonstration of the fact that religion is not involved here at all, let us consider this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.331" offset="10689682">The day off which the legislature in Pennsylvania believes will result from this is in no way conditioned upon a religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.434" offset="10734090">It is untrue that if anyone suggests that I deny it, that an Orthodox Jew who will refrain from selling to the public on Sunday in any way, shape or form, either violates his religious tenets or observes the tenets of some other religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.140" offset="10820921">That has nothing to do with it and in this case, it is clear beyond any question that if the retail employees and the individual entrepreneurs who are small retailers, if they are to get Sunday off because this statute should be declared constitutional, they'll get Sunday off even if they use it to play golf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.446" offset="10910156">Now, considering the other hand, your Zorach decision in which the majority of this Court upheld a time off case in the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.593" offset="10950802">Now, there, it was interesting because the time off could only be obtained in the first instance if you use that and proved you used it for religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.339" offset="10997718">In this case, there's no connection whatsoever between the use that you make of the time off, the day off you get from the statute and religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.434" offset="11034081">And so I say to Your Honors that this has nothing to do with the sensation of work, day of rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.162" offset="11073055">This is simply an economic and sociological statute and therefore in my judgment, we are not dealing with the situation involving the establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.684" offset="11123106">I think that point will further be developed in the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.771" offset="11143481">Now, we come to the second branch of the religious argument and the argument made by these five plaintiffs is that regardless of the fact which I gather they concede that this was an economically based law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.419" offset="11202100">It does have such an effect as to cause this Court to bring into play the -- the great weight of the First Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.415" offset="11886090">Now, there you had a -- a different kind of situation where you take your polygamy cases where some people believe, the Mormons at that time believed that as part of their religious observance, they should have more than one spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.133" offset="11948889">And in that case, the Court said that the religious law naturally has to be subservient to a universally applicable civil or nonreligious law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.127" offset="12004895">Now, I think we come to the nub of the case where we ask this question well is there any economic impact whatsoever on these five plaintiffs, Orthodox Jews?</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.523" offset="12050453">Now, I am going to concede before the bar of this Court that there is an economic impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.551" offset="12074590">I do not deny that, but we must examine very carefully what kind of economic impact it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.121" offset="12100921">Does it come because the law, in any way, prohibits them from exercising their religion?</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.725" offset="12123282">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.040" offset="12128507">As I explained it, it has nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.460" offset="12138224">The -- it -- it is something which is neither direct nor immediate but on the contrary, it is consequential and it is more than that, it isn't even universally applicable because not all Orthodox Jews will suffer economic impact as a result of this kind of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.045" offset="12212621">As a matter of fact, although it isn't in our statute but just hypothetically, the kosher butchers and I'm surprised this wasn't raised yesterday, a kosher butcher shop deals with the people who will by Kosher meat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.591" offset="12274792">Now, Kosher, I can conceive of many kosher butchers who would like to have a five-day week because their customers are people who must buy from them so that they would suffer no economic impact if for example, that were included in the commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.713" offset="12335292">I point that out to show that the economic impact which I concede here is of such nature that it is personal to the individuals and relates primarily to the -- their voluntary entry to this particular type of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.988" offset="12396314">It's like the Mohammedan trial there and I say that this kind of economic impact clearly does not come within the protected arm of the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.088" offset="12744788">As Your Honors will note from the next case, Two Guys from Harrison deals with one of these suburban discount houses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.695" offset="12787210">There is no question of -- their of -- their observing any religion and yet, they claim, and I suppose the record would support this claim that they're dependent upon the sales they make on Sunday and without that, they say, they are going out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.363" offset="12865891">Now, I’m pointing that out of course it seems to me that that irrefutably demonstrates that the nature of the economic impact as against these five Orthodox Jews is one which is personal to them and cannot be the basis for striking down a law on the ground that it violates the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.987" offset="13340379">I agree with Your Honor there and I feel the second point is, in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart, that the fact that there might be available to the legislature of Pennsylvania, an alternative, namely the putting in of an exemption might be something to be addressed to the legislature, but that certainly would be no basis for striking down this law and I think as Mr. Justice Black pointed out in the celebrated Everson opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.531" offset="13462528">The mere fact that a -- a state law favors or not favors, but coincides with the personal wishes of many people, is no basis for striking it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.262" offset="13513415">And so I would come back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.516" offset="13522505">The mere fact that a mandatory day off would coincide with a Sunday which most people want from both religious and no religious and a variety of reasons would be no -- no basis whatsoever for striking it down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3377.451" offset="13614247">And we are here with -- confront it with the question in this Act of a non-exempting statute, applicable only to certain retailers who sell certain items.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3388.480" stopTime="3389.436">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3388.480" offset="13658342">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_berger" startTime="3389.436" stopTime="3709.217">
            <label>Mr. David Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="3389.436" offset="13662104">Now, It is because of this analysis that we have concluded that, number one, there is no establishment of a religion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.954" offset="13700242">There is no religious origin, purpose or effect here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.896" offset="13716020">Number two, there is no prohibition against the free exercise of any religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.950" offset="13740157">Now, and then it seems to me that the case boils down under the all Common Garden Variety Fourteenth Amendment Case is this -- is there something about this which violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.877" offset="13791880">I think the best answer to that and very frankly, that's the reason we didn't labor the point, can be found in -- in Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Hasty's opinion on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.807" offset="13847573">And in that case, it's printed that the -- the relevant portion of his opinion will be found on page 13 and 14 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.327" offset="13885712">That's the -- the -- we call brief, white brief there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.646" offset="13907028">In this, he points out the reasons why and they were intensely practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.877" offset="13927926">The legislature didn't go off, off the fact there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.627" offset="13938897">They picked out these particular items because as Judge Hasty pointed out, these were the very items which large discount houses were selling as which were triggering off the series of competitive sales on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.943" offset="14004203">And that was the reason why the department stores and the labor unions supported this particular kind of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.039" offset="14036595">So that once you get a -- once you grade, as I believe you should, that regardless of Massachusetts thought that this particular Act in 1959 does not involve the First Amendment, then I think you must also agree that the attack on the grounds of the equal protections fails because there is an economic basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.833" offset="14115694">And I would never attempt to justify these myriad of exceptions on ground -- religious grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.319" offset="14145682">I'm saying that they're justifiable because this is the opinion of the legislature of Pennsylvania of how to meet the economic and social need which I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.655" offset="14191031">It maybe that -- that some of the justices would disagree with the legislators but that's not the test of constitutionality and it is certainly not without rhyme or reason as Mr. Justice Frankfurter -- Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.568" offset="14246619">Where the legislature acts along as it isn't without rhyme or reason, this Court isn't going to strike down its actions simply because alternatives exist or because it might take a slightly different route to that particular end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.843" offset="14319762">I -- I would like to say just one other word, although it hasn't been raised, I think in the arguments yesterday, some of the Justices did raise the question of police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.106" offset="14364797">I don't think there's any violation of the Fourteenth Amendment Police Power Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.134" offset="14384964">I think that -- I -- Fourteenth Amendment, I believe that this is a valid exercise of Pennsylvania's police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.763" offset="14415475">And therefore, you don't have the normal Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.011" offset="14432402">I understand it has been argued or will be argued that it is unconstitutional for a state to select quite apart from religious grounds, a uniform mandatory day off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.564" offset="14490603">We couldn't be more in disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.793" offset="14499589">We say that whereas here, there are sociological and economic basis for a uniform mandatory day off such as I have described in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.525" offset="14546505">That then, that is a legitimate basis for the operation of Pennsylvania or other state's police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.541" offset="14582554">We think in the end, this case can be summarized on a religious point by what Circuit Judge Learned Hand said in the famous Atwood case at 205 F.2d, cited in my brief and if Your Honors will indulge me, I would like just to read this because it summarizes my own philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.719" offset="14659250">The First Amendment said Learned Hand, Judge Hand, protects one against action by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.691" offset="14683178">Though even then, not in all circumstances, but it gives no one the right to insist that in the pursuit of their own interest, others must conform their conduct to his own religious necessities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.279" offset="14733542">A man might find it incompatible with his conscience to live in a city in which open saloons were licensed and yet he would have no constitutional right to insist that the saloons must be closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.919" offset="14792056">He would have to leave the city or put up with the iniquitous thence no matter what economic loss, his change of domicile entailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.644" offset="14835001">We must accommodate our idiosyncrasies, religious as well as secular to the compromises necessary in communal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.915" offset="14876066">Now we can hope for no reward for the sacrifices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.970" offset="14892262">This may require beyond our satisfaction from within or our expectations of a better world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.518" offset="14926430">Thank you.</text>
