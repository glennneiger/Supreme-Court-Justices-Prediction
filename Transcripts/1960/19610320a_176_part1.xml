            <text syncTime="106.775" offset="530474">Following consultation with petitioner, following an investigation of the facts, it was determined that petitioner would plead guilty, petitioner acknowledging that he did commit the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.470" offset="801207">Yes Your Honor, page 27 of the record where I advised the district court of this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.072" offset="827643">This was before Judge Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.776" offset="854497">Now, I should state further, in this connection that on June 16th when the arraignment proceedings were held and when petitioner pleaded not guilty, the case was set on the trial calendar for July 15, which was a time at which Judge Peirson Hall would have taken over the trial calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.040" offset="947493">In the district, the judges serve successive terms, and therefore, the case was placed on the calendar at a time after which Judge Hall would have taken over.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.713" offset="986258">Now, prior to the time that Judge Hall would have taken over or did take over the trial calendar, following the conference with the United States Attorney, I requested the United States Attorney to place the matter back on the calendar for a change in plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.136" offset="1043937">The United States Attorney did this at my request and placed it on the calendar of the tri-- of the judge who was then presiding over the criminal calendar, who was Judge Thurmond Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.723" offset="1094301">When this took place on June 26th, at which time, I appeared with petitioner before Judge Clark and moved for a change of plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.221" offset="1144247">The plea was changed on counts 1 and 2 and petitioner at that time stated that he wished to plead guilty to counts 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.012" offset="1183431">I, then, requested Judge Clark to impose an immediate sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.830" offset="1242676">I believe that this will appear on either 15 or 16 of the record -- on page 15 and 16, and I believe it will appear also in the minute orders, although I'm not sure what page of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.677" offset="1354062">In any event, following the acceptance of the plea by Judge Clark, I asked -- requested immediate sentence on the grounds that the petitioner would get no credit for any time that he served while awaiting sentence because there was a mandatory minimum sentence of five years with no possibility of probation and/or parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.419" offset="1437027">So, I asked for an immediate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.368" offset="1444864">Judge Clark, then, responded and said that he would be willing to impose or would impose a sentence of five years to run concurrently on each count and it -- that it would take effect immediately.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Reinhardt</label>
            <text syncTime="380.522" offset="1625422">Well, that was where I understood the practice to be, that the -- that the sentence would be four to five years and that it would be effective as of the date of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.565" offset="1661680">Now, it is possible that the court might, under some circumstances, I don't know, be able to enter a retroactive sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.088" offset="1699715">But, the reason I gave at that time, and this was the reason that I had, was that I felt that he should not serve dead time and that, ordinarily, credit is not given for dead time.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.856" offset="1758751">So, I -- in that -- upon my request for an immediate sentence, the court, as I indicated, announced that the sentence would be five years, concurrent on each count.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.512" offset="1801383">At that point, the Assistant US States Attorney objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.472" offset="1817266">His objection, as he stated, was not as to the length of the sentence, but as he said, policy-wise, he objected to the imposition of the sentence on a man when there was a co-defendant who had not yet been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.680" offset="1882049">Judge Clark explained his objection by stating that the Government was afraid that if the petitioner was sentenced, then he would be free at the trial of the co-defendant to take the stand and testify for the co-defendant and, the Government wanted to avoid this.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.222" offset="1952266">I replied to Judge Clark that I felt that this was not a valid reason to delay the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.407" offset="1977031">That, in the event that petitioner perjured himself at a subsequent trial, that the solution to that was to try him for perjury, but that it was not a proper practice to keep a man in jail awaiting sentence in order to ensure his testimony at a subsequent trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.376" offset="2052890">That, in fact, this was inconsistent with the administration of justice because it did not encourage truthful testimony, but it kept a club hanging over the head of a man who was awaiting sentence, and that sentence should not be delayed for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.838" offset="2114748">In response to my argument, Judge Clark said “well, you don't have to worry about your defendant because I have given you my word, and I give you my word now, he will be returned here after the trial of the co-defendant and he will be sentenced to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.850" offset="2178800">I give you my word on that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="522.601" offset="2193742">The next event that took place and this does not appear in the record, but it is my way of explanation, is that I received a telephone call from the clerk that the -- that Judge Hall had taken jurisdiction over the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.316" offset="2248600">Now, the record shows that, on July 9th, the co-defendant, Palomino, who was set for trial before Judge Hall moved for a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.665" offset="2290082">Judge Hall granted the continuance of the trial until July 29th, a delay of two weeks, and that the record shows that this was ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.648" offset="2325922">It was an ex parte hearing that the petitioner was not there, petitioner's counsel was not there, and it is unclear, although I do not believe, the United States Attorney was there either.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.614" offset="2365837">At this proceeding concerned with Palomino alone, Judge Hall ordered petitioner transferred before him for sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.613" offset="2589863">Now, the record is somewhat unclear as to this, except that the United -- Assistant United States Attorney's statement is set forth at pages 19-20 of the record, I believe, yes, Your Honors, it's at page -- pages 19-20 where the United States Attorney explains this.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.821" offset="2670634">In any event, the proceedings were held by Judge Hall with respect to -- on July 21st and 22nd, but petitioner's counsel was not there because Judge Hall had stated that he would not sentence until July 29th since he had continued the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.187" offset="2736149">Now, on July 29th was the next time that petitioner's counsel appeared in court, and this was before Judge Hall pursuant to the advice I had received that the case had been transferred to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.007" offset="2787349">On July 29th, the court was advised that Palomino had skipped bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.870" offset="2810859">Now, as I've indicated, the explanation that Judge Hall had given as to why he transferred petitioner was that he didn't want to take a half of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.696" offset="2850147">He believed that if he were going to try one defendant, he should also sentence the co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.306" offset="2872613">Now, Palomino, having disappeared, there was no trial pending for him and all that was left before Judge Hall now was the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.307" offset="2920573">When the clerk announced that petitioner was here and was here for sentencing, Judge Hall said “well, I'm not going to sentence him now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="710.990" offset="2947323">At that point, I stated to Judge Hall, began to explain the circumstances of the case and how petitioner had appeared before him, and began to make a motion to transfer the case back to Judge Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.771" offset="3006464">Judge Hall, before I completed my entire explanation, came to the conclusion that this apparently smacks too much of having the appearance of a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.456" offset="3049200">That if petitioner would plead guilty, he would get five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.726" offset="3066232">Now, this conclusion is wholly without support in the record or in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.938" offset="3099146">This is a conclusion of Judge Hall's, for which there may be explanations with relation to the problems that may exist in the District Court in Southern California, but as to which petitioner was wholly innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.498" offset="3153377">There was nothing that would justify the smacking of the appearance of a deal in Judge Hall's court and Judge Hall's words, and he made no inquiry or no attempt to find out any facts or to explore any facts which might support this conclusion of his.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.375" offset="3236864">Rather, he said that, because it might have the appearance of a deal, he would vacate the pleas and order the defendant to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.774" offset="3274480">Despite petitioner's objections, Judge Hall did, in fact, vacate the pleas of guilty and set the entire case for trial approximately 10 days later.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.170" offset="3604041">There was no discussion with the United States Attorney about this, never any suggestion that there would be -- no mention of sentence at all until Judge Clark, in open court, announced the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.723" offset="4870248">But, he felt it was necessary to delay the sentence because those were the only two counts on which the Government ever had any intention of continuing the prosecution and that in the arrangement which was sanctioned by Judge Clark when he accepted the pleas, that this was a disposition of this entire crime and was always intended to be a disposition and I don't think that the Government now denies that that was intended to be a disposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.635" offset="5813896">Perhaps the place to start is where the Government starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.594" offset="5825703">The Government suggests in its brief, at page 31, that even if all the legal issues were decided in their favor, there is a question whether, under the supervisory power of this Court, this Court should enforce the word of the district court in order to uphold the principles of administration of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.563" offset="5905638">There's a case in the circuit court, the Franco case cited in our briefs, where a judge announced an intention to dispo -- to give a particular sentence and the circuit court said even to the most venial of its subjects, the word of the court must be kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.657" offset="5966033">Now, the word of the court here includes not only counts 1 and 2, but counts 3, 4, and 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.802" offset="5990588">The question is vacating an entire disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.803" offset="6002604">The counts -- the guilty pleas on 1 and 2 cannot be separated from the dismissals on 3, 4, and 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.890" offset="6026951">This is one integrated settlement of a case and, if you decide or if this Court decides that 1 and 2 can be vacated properly, then there's no problem with 3, 4, and 5, but you cannot separate 3, 4, and 5 from 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.053" offset="6083584">This was a solution, a disposition, and a judicially approved agreement of an entire matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.180" offset="6244080">Secondly, we think that the failure to dismiss in -- on a written form that this is a technical objection to which the answer is that it was tantamount to a dismissal, that there was everything done by the formal entry of the dismissal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert A. Bernhard</label>
            <text syncTime="2382.347" offset="9632789">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.026" offset="9651493">As Mr. Reinhardt has announced, I will discuss the trial errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.036" offset="9671555">Our basic proposition here is that if you're going to force a man into a trial which he has tried to avoid, which he never wanted, which he's been fighting several years to avoid the effects of, that the very least that can be done is that he'd be entitled to a full and a fair and a proper trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.929" offset="9771133">And, we contend that petitioner did not get such a full and fair and proper trial in this case in at least three major areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.070" offset="9815646">The first is with reference to the fifth count of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.817" offset="9834663">The fifth count of the indictment as did the prior three, charged sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.216" offset="9856188">The first count was a conspiracy count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.448" offset="9865174">The other four were sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.914" offset="9879071">This is a particular importance to petitioner here because any error in this count was certainly prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.005" offset="9903417">His sentence on that count was 10 years consecutive to the other counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.957" offset="9931212">Now, the error which we allege with respect to the fifth count is very simply that our timely motions for judgment of acquittal should have been granted on this count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.105" offset="9991816">In essence, our contention is that the corpus delicti of the crime was not proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.169" offset="10016057">The facts are very simply these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.653" offset="10029955">In the first three sales, the arrangements had been made to transfer the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.443" offset="10061093">The petitioner brought the narcotics to his buyer, unbeknownst to him, a Government Agent Licuanan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.976" offset="10087320">He handed the narcotics to Licuanan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.117" offset="10099858">Licuanan, in the first two cases, examined the narcotics, smelled it to see that it seemed to be narcotic, and then paid over the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.164" offset="10139982">When we get to the fourth sale, the fifth count, we have a somewhat different circumstance and we say that this is decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.542" offset="10173524">What happened here was that, at the instance that petitioner got -- first got possession of these drugs, the government agent came over, and this is all based on the testimony of the government agents and there is no dispute as to this testimony, the government agent came over while petitioner still had the narcotics in his hands and pulls his gun and placed petitioner under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.082" offset="10291702">At that point, the petitioner threw the bag at the narcotics agent and ran away, obviously trying to escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.494" offset="10325347">He didn't make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.846" offset="10330781">Other agents captured him and that's how we stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.549" offset="10341543">Now petitioner contends that this was perhaps, a contract of sale, perhaps it was an attempt to sell, but it was no sale because no sale ever took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.206" offset="10464214">There had been no transfer of the money, Your Honor, and the course of conduct showed that the money was always transferred after the actual delivery of the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.787" offset="10498487">And, I must say, the Government, on page 37 of its brief where it's talking about the conspiracy aspect of this case, concedes that deliveries are elements of sale and it concedes it with reference to these deliveries and these sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.939" offset="10571107">Now, there is just no doubt that there was no delivery in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.283" offset="10604544">I -- the sale is something which is not a continuing course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.124" offset="10635891">It either takes place or it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.196" offset="10648116">And, if you're going to have a seller, you must, at the same time, determine that you had a buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.191" offset="10668178">You have got to find some instant at -- of time at which this sale took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.395" offset="10688972">Now, there is no basis that we can see for saying that the mere making of a contract was the conduct which was proscribed by Congress when it forbad the making of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.915" offset="10739022">This is, as was pointed out in answer to questions, is a very serious statute containing very serious penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.136" offset="10767966">It runs from 5 to 20 years as an absolute minimum without possibility of parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.360" offset="10848841">It has always been the rule of this Court that these statutes are to be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.519" offset="10877471">The gaps are not filled in by the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.158" offset="10888025">The gaps have to be filled in by the Congress, if there are any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.422" offset="10901086">And, I may point out that this statute has been in existence for over 50 years in this particular and that, notwithstanding all the steps that the Congress has taken to change the law, to make greater penalties, or to proscribe other conduct, they have never indicated that a mere executory contract of sale would be a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.048" offset="10991574">It is not under ordinary sales law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.532" offset="11001501">It is not, even if you add the fact of appropriation which the Government mentions in its brief, it simply does not constitute a sale either under ordinary sales law or under the policy which we contend this Court should announce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.304" offset="11080600">I think the Court should consider that this is not ordinary property in the ordinary sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.583" offset="11113723">This is something where there really is no title interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.903" offset="11130964">You can't give a bill of sale for narcotics and have it enforced in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.298" offset="11156564">The only real interest that you have in a narcotic is the possessory interest and until you transfer this possessory interest, you've transferred nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.274" offset="11208495">And, I think that this is the way it should be as a matter of construction of this law because if you were to take the Government's position that a mere executory contract of sale is enough, then you have characterized not only a seller, but a buyer at a point where they merely have the intent, perhaps, to go ahead and subsequently transfer narcotics and you have then said that both of these people can be tried and sentenced to a minimum of five years without possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.276" offset="11344436">We simply say that, on the facts here, there was no delivery and without delivery in this case, there was not the crime comprehended by the (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.300" offset="11772531">That's 114 of the record, Your Honor, in the supplementary record which was printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.476" offset="11801266">Turning to the other areas of error, one major area is the treatment with respect to the informer in this case, Mr. Singh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.428" offset="11865109">Now, to back somewhat on the facts, this was a typical entrapment situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.406" offset="11889037">I don't mean by that that entrapment was proven but what I mean is that the inducement was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.438" offset="11913174">Mr. Singh, who was the informer, Mr. Licuanan who was the agent in the case approached petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.151" offset="11940028">They bore a note from petitioner's cousin who was in jail who asked-- the note was addressed to petitioner and had asked petitioner to help these two people to get some money from narcotics so that they might use part of this money in order to help the cousin get bail and get out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.976" offset="12031248">The entrapment, if there was any, arises out of this initial conversation between the agent, the informer, and the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.808" offset="12074611">In the case for the United States, the United States simply put on the agent but it did not call the informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.805" offset="12114631">At first, when Mr. Reinhardt tried to find out the name of the informer, this was refused to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.868" offset="12138872">When he cited the Rivero case of this Court, the United States changed its position and gave him the name and they promised that, the following morning, the man would be in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.457" offset="12189236">Of course, this was in a trial situation and he had to -- when Singh appeared in court, Mr. Reinhardt was conducting the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.506" offset="12229360">There was some discussion between the court and Mr. Reinhardt as to what sort of instruction would be given because of the Government's failure to call Mr. Singh as a witness, and the court said “I will not instruct that this man was a material witness to the Government and that his testimony should be presumed to be adverse to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.099" offset="12311803">The court then went on to say, when Mr. Reinhardt said “well, we're raising the issue of entrapment,” the court then went on to say “well, if he's material to your case, I'll give an instruction against you if the Government requests it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.445" offset="12365197">So, at this point, petitioner is faced with the fact that he is irrevocably bound to this Government informer, a man who is acknowledged to be a special employee of the government who, it later turns out, is under – has -- is an admitted narcotics user and has not been prosecuted for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.652" offset="12445968">So, the Government has this over his head and, yet, all of the sudden, he becomes our man, sort of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.122" offset="12475852">Mr. Reinhardt, during lunch time, tries to talk to Mr. Singh and finds that he has been frustrated in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.187" offset="12500093">The United States Attorney has advised Mr. Singh that he doesn't have to talk to Mr. Reinhardt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.952" offset="12523186">So, Mr. Reinhardt knows nothing now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.581" offset="12533739">He gets no information from Mr. Singh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.557" offset="12545651">This is in the face of the Rivero case of this Court where this Court has said the question of determining whether or not the informer should be interrogated, whether his story should be put on the stand is for the accused, not the Government, to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.036" offset="12611480">And then, when Mr. Singh is finally put on the stand, the court refuses to allow Mr. Reinhardt to treat him as a witness hostile ab initio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.709" offset="12658186">And, I point out to the Court that this was the only other witness to the entrapment conversations and this was a man who was bound to the Government not only because of the US advising him that he didn't have to talk to Mr. Reinhardt, but just because of the circumstances that the United States had even indicated that if they gave his name, his life might be in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.322" offset="12752645">And, that was of -- the implication was only from petitioner and, yet, all throughout here, we are not allowed to treat him as a witness adverse to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.951" offset="12791202">We are bound by his testimony if we call him and, if we don't call him, then we're going to get an instruction that his testimony would have been adverse to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.390" offset="12832893">And, we say, if you look at the questions that were asked, some of them were valid, whether he's a hostile witness or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.270" offset="12856404">We questioned, “Are you an employee of the United States Government?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.069" offset="12879600">There's certainly nothing wrong with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.083" offset="12891721">In the Sherman case and as well as in Sorrow, this Court has recognized that you are allowed to get into the question of the conduct of the government agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.535" offset="12945533">The same thing with the other questions, they were proper and they were particularly proper in this circumstance and, in effect, here was an entire frustration of an attempt to interrogate and bring before the court this essential witness.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3344.318" offset="13480626">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.079" offset="13499643">This is a case which has given me very grave concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.934" offset="13519078">I find it a difficult and troublesome case because it seems to turn on a delicate question of judicial administration, including two district judges, one, the chief judge of his district, on questions which certainly affect confidence in the fairness and rationality of the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.246" offset="13608312">We think, I would like to say at the start, that the case may well call for some modification of the judgment below under -- in an exercise of the supervisory power of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.566" offset="13657631">But, at the same time, our view of the case is quite different from that expressed on behalf of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.736" offset="13690337">I can summarize the Government's position best in three propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.358" offset="13712802">First, it seems to us that each of the rulings in the district court viewed by itself whether before a trial, during the trial, or upon sentencing was well within the power of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.997" offset="13771316">And that, indeed, none of the rulings inv -- looked at by themselves involved any error of law and I will tell in a few instances, the questions may be closer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.714" offset="13814262">We also think that there was no abuse of discretion involved in any single ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.303" offset="13840593">Our trouble comes, second, when we look at the case as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.738" offset="13858356">It seems to me -- it seems to us that there was much more doubt about the net effect of all the rulings and if viewed as a whole, beginning with Judge Clark's promise of a 5-year-sentence and ending with Judge Hall's imposition of a 20-year-sentence, the proceeding may not meet those standards of fairness and rationality which ought to characterize the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.118" offset="13963891">Third, we point out that the difficulties arose from differences in sentencing practice and in the administration of the criminal calendar in the District Court for the Southern District of California, a matter, which I will point out later, has now been corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.240" offset="14044348">They are not mistakes, if they were mistakes, which resulted from the Government's position or, indeed, later when they urged upon the Court by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.101" offset="14091786">Under these circumstances, we think that our function is discharged when we disclose the problem fairly to the Court and address ourselves to the considerations on either side because we do think that there are considerations on either side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.271" offset="14156466">Now, in the course of my argument, I want, first, to talk -- address myself to the general cha -- question whether the character of the proceeding was consistent with fairness and rationality, and I postpone for the moment the specific questions of law and the specific questions of the power of the judge's to make these individual rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.064" offset="14243610">I will deal with them at the close of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.387" offset="14260955">We can best approach the general question by taking a bird's eye view of the stream of events even though this does involve some repetition of what's already been said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.155" offset="14311946">There were two defendants, Palomino and Saldana, the petitioner here, who were indicted for narcotics violations in five counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.611" offset="14349772">The first was a conspiracy count and the other four dealt with sales of narcotics, each coming about a week after the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.734" offset="14386343">On June 16, both defendants were arraigned before Judge Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.206" offset="14412152">At that time, we get the first intimation of one of the causes of the difficulty in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.786" offset="14450500">At page 14 of the record, you will find that Palomino's lawyer was very anxious to keep the case from being transferred to Judge Hall's calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.323" offset="14504626">At that time, Judge Clark was in-charge of the criminal calendar in the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.241" offset="14528345">His period was about to run out on June 30 and Judge Hall would come in as the criminal judge beginning jud -- July 1 and Mr. Tener, representing Palomino, says “Your Honor, may I also be heard briefly as to whether this matter of necessity must be transferred to Judge Hall.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.096" offset="14607757">I think it's fair to say that the bar in that area, rightly or wrongly, regards Judge Clark as lenient in narcotics cases and Judge Hall as being a good deal more severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.222" offset="14668257">About 12 days later, on June 26, it was now getting close to June 30, petitioner came in with his counsel before Judge Clark and pleaded guilty on two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.516" offset="14729488">I think counsel is -- speaks fairly when he says that it was anticipated that if the plea of guilty were accepted on the two counts that, then, the remaining counts would be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.309" offset="14780583">The two counts might cover a sentence of 40 years and if there was a plea of guilty to those two counts, there was really no need from anybody's point of view of going to trial on the remaining counts so far as the severity of the sentence might be concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.432" offset="14869086">The defendant came in and then asked for immediate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.664" offset="14898030">As one reads the record, as it appears on page 16 and 17, it's quite clear that the Defendant must have carried away two impressions, one that he would be sentenced before Judge Clark and, second, that Judge Clark would give him the minimum sentence of five years to run concurrently on each of the first two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.376" offset="14988831">I think it might also be said now, although it becomes important later, that it is fairly plain that everyone had forgotten about counts 3, 4, and 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.803" offset="15030627">If you'll note, on page 17 of the record, they've been talking about counts 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.386" offset="15056959">Then, the court said that he didn't want a probation report because he was going to give the minimum anyway, then, there was -- counsel said “we will waive the probation report.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.929" offset="15095097">The court, “alright,” a short intermission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.584" offset="15105755">Then, the --</text>

            <text syncTime="3834.085" offset="15439705">On a point of view of technical about it, I suppose, there's a distinction between a presentence report and the probation report that actually affects it I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.320" offset="15480665">What the court has asked you is not a probation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.926" offset="15495084">He said no because he couldn't have probation anyway.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3853.454" offset="15517236">The rule, of course, doesn't speak of a probation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.744" offset="15538343">It speaks strictly of a presentence investigation and making a report to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.497" offset="15565406">So that this is a colloquialism in either event and I think you're quite right that Judge Clark was thinking of it as showing whether this man deserved probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.367" offset="15604799">The point I was seeking to make was to call attention to the fact that so far as counts 3, 4, and 5 were concerned, I think it's fair to say that the expectation was that they would be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.585" offset="15657671">The fact is that apparently the district judge was not aware of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.321" offset="15680658">It was the clerk who said, as counsel were about to leave the room, “just a minute Mr. Sheraton, Mr. Saldana is charged with counts 3, 4, and 5.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.788" offset="15718484">That was the first time they were mentioned and, the disposition was hold those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.255" offset="15736351">There was clearly no ruling about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.707" offset="15750248">Now, at this point, it's necessary for me to leave the facts of this case for a moment and explain the practice in handling criminal cases in the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.074" offset="15791626">As it existed at the time of this case, I'll explain the changes later, it's important to understand what it was at the time of this case now, if a defendant was indicted as the single defendant and came in, before he was arraigned, before the judge who had the criminal documents, and if he pleaded guilty, that judge would then pass sentence upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.199" offset="15896116">If he pleaded not guilty, the case might be tried by the judge who was handling the criminal document or it might be sent out to another judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.167" offset="15936031">If there were two defendants and one pleaded guilty and the other was to be tried, then the practice of some of the judges in the Southern District of California was to have sentence imposed by the judge who conducted the trial of the defendant who pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.206" offset="16032162">This has obvious fairness and sense in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.443" offset="16045119">It enables the man who passed sentence to have heard something about the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.883" offset="16062882">It's a way of not breaking off two men who joined together in defense and bringing them before different judges, one of whom would almost surely pass sentence without regard to what might be done by the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.956" offset="16115231">Now, District Judge Hall, the Chief Judge I am informed, uniformly followed this practice that when the case was sent out to a judge to try it, then any co-defendant who pleaded guilty went out with the judge and, of course, that's reflected in what happened later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.880" offset="16182941">That was not, however, the practice of all the district judges in the Southern District of California at this time and I infer that it was not Judge Clark's practice, although I have no specific knowledge upon that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.651" offset="16253994">The practice was reflected when, somewhat later, on July 9, we find a minute entry transferring Saldana's case from Judge Clark's docket before Judge Hall who was to try Palomino, the co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.253" offset="16348348">It was done when Palomino's counsel came in and asked for a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.098" offset="16375724">Judge Hall apparently noticed that it was a co-defendant and said “have him transferred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.660" offset="16397981">When I take a case, I take the whole case” and notify his counsel accordingly and that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.213" offset="16432253">Then, the case came on, after continuances, before Judge Hall on July 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.150" offset="16471960">This quite clearly defeated Saldana's expectation that he would be sentenced before Judge Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.680" offset="16502053">It also, when Judge Hall vacated the guilty pleas to the first count -- first two counts, of course set in train a series of events that defeated his expectations on the first two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.072" offset="16555656">These rulings were reaffirmed on August 1st and the case against Saldana, Palomino having jumped bail, came on for trial at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.724" offset="16606229">I think it's worth noting the grounds that Judge Hall gave for his action, as I discern them from pages 24 and 25 and then again 28 and 29 of the record at first -- I'll take those up after the recess.</text>
