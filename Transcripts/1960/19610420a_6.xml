            <text syncTime="8.535" offset="137488">May it please -- Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.762" offset="170402">Yesterday afternoon when the recess occurred, I was about to discuss the opinion of the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.115" offset="203839">The opinion maybe found at page 214 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.497" offset="237380">The three-judge court announced the following rule as applicable and decisive of the case in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.483" offset="285341">From a review of these decisions, referring to the decisions on page 216 of the opinion, the court said that, “The federal courts whether from a lack of jurisdiction or from the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial consideration will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment."</text>
            <text syncTime="75.052" offset="403623">The court thought it was highly significant that the question of reapportionment had been before the state court in the case of Kidd versus McCanless and the court points out that it is significant that the case of Kidd versus McCanless involved the identical apportionment statutes and the identical state of facts as confronted the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.463" offset="553253">The court also pointed out that in view of Kidd versus McCanless and other opinions from this Court, it did not think that question could be adjudicated in that court as -- or was appropriate for judicial relief.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="139.073" offset="659623">It wasn't passed, it wasn't adjudicated here?</text>

          <turn speaker="james_m_glasgow" startTime="141.124" stopTime="469.350">
            <label>Mr. James M. Glasgow</label>
            <text syncTime="141.124" offset="667878">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.577" offset="669654">If -- that wasn't appealed to this Court in that case and this Court dismissed the appeal on the authority of Colegrove versus Green and Anderson versus Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.151" offset="720018">Now, the court also points out that the suggested remedies that had been asked for in the complaint are indirect in the sense that they are not sought directly against the legislature of Tennessee and this is a lawsuit involving state administrative and judicial officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.055" offset="827643">The court also pointed out that it could -- had no authority to order an election at large as prayed for in the complaint and that if it were to do so, it would lead to serious geographical inequalities and other discriminations probably -- probably to a greater extent than those already existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.468" offset="937253">The court then said that the Constitution of the State vested the duty of making an enumeration of voters squarely in the hands of the State legislature and concluded by pointing out that this would amount to nothing more than a kind of judicial legislation and an unwarranted intrusion into the political affairs of the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.849" offset="1078732">General Wilson and I have divided the issues to be argued here this afternoon and I will deal primarily with the questions of state law which are involved, which we think are important and which we think are decisive of the question and that the Court need not reach the alleged federal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.686" offset="1178102">If my time permits, I will also discuss the issue of justiciability and General Wilson will go into the questions of discrimination and the proposed remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.306" offset="1228570">Briefly, I would summarize our contentions at this point and point out that we think that state law is decisive of this lawsuit that the issues here are not justiciable as between the parties, that the subject -- there is -- there are no adverse interests, that the suit is unauthorized under the -- the Eleventh Amendment and the subject matter generally is not justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.576" offset="1357720">We insist that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction of the question and that reapportionment is a political or a legislative question.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.231" offset="1396276">We think that the Court has already announced principles which decide the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.146" offset="1423966">We further insist that there is no discrimination and that the 1901 statute is valid in Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.436" offset="1461164">What is the issue in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="343.646" offset="1477987">Is it voting rights or is it a Republican Form of Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="350.203" offset="1504214">If I understand the -- the proposition stated in the argument of the Solicitor General's brief, I believe it's on page 17, in the opening sentence he said the issue involves the proposition of fair representation in the legislative halls.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.423" offset="1597106">It's one thing to insist upon voting rights, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.463" offset="1617272">We think that it's quite another thing to insist upon fair representation and a Republican Form of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.779" offset="1654471">In turning to the state law and we are aware of the cases which this Court has said that it is loath, I believe the term is, to decide questions of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.060" offset="1715597">The Court has also said that it doesn't like to venture into the delicate field of faith of federal and state relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.430" offset="1769096">With that in mind, I would like to discuss for a few moments, the Tennessee constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.999" offset="1811414">Yesterday, it was brought to the attention of the Court that Article I, Section 5 of the Tennessee Constitution, guarantees the right of suffrage and also elections shall be free and equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.663" offset="1905977">We insist that Article IV of the Constitution and not Article I, Section 5, controls the right to vote in the state and the right here certainly is a state right because it involves the election of state officers.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_m_glasgow" startTime="474.420" stopTime="812.459">
            <label>Mr. James M. Glasgow</label>
            <text syncTime="474.420" offset="2001063">We think so, if Your Honor please?</text>
            <text syncTime="476.207" offset="2008168">We think that in view of the -- this Court's opinions in the various cases such as Smiley versus Holm, Carroll versus Becker, Wood versus Broom and others that there is a federal right that is guaranteed to a citizen of the United States to vote for a congressman under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.818" offset="2106598">On the other hand, the Federal Constitution is silent on the question of state legislatures and state representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.658" offset="2154036">Article I, Section 5 of our Constitution, which is in the Bill of Rights, is very brief and with the Court's permission, I would like to read the first sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.620" offset="2229896">“The elections shall be free and equal and the right of suffrage, as here and after declared, shall never be denied to any person entitled thereto, except upon a conviction by a jury of some infamous crime previously ascertained and declared below and judgment thereon by Court of Competent Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.328" offset="2324668">Now, the words that were not pointed out to the Court yesterday and I'm sure that was by inadvertence, are the words “here and after declared” and that we insist the -- refers to Article IV, Section 1 of our Constitution which prescribes then of the voting qualifications and defines the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.086" offset="2431666">Now, every citizen or a person in Tennessee who is a age of 21 years, who has been a resident of the State for 12 months and who has resided in his county for 3 months, is guaranteed the right to vote under Article IV, Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.851" offset="2522781">Now, none of these appellants insist that they have been denied access to the ballot box.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.986" offset="2555277">None of these appellants insist that they haven't been permitted to cast their votes in free and equal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.736" offset="2586311">None, except insofar as Article I, Section 5 is concerned, none of them insist that their votes have not been counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.495" offset="2625390">And we insist, may it please the Court, that in considering what their rights are in regard to the right of suffrage if they meet these qualifications and they participate in elections, that is all that they're entitled to by way of a right to vote under the State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.029" offset="2735522">I would also point out that we have a provision in our Constitution which is similar to the provision in the Federal Constitution that the General Assembly shall be the judges of the qualifications of its members and also of their election.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.822" offset="2826637">Now, the federal cases I think are very clear that that is an exclusive function of the legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.166" offset="2868015">That is that body exclusively determines what the qualifications of its members may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.052" offset="2899571">It also exclusively determines what -- whether or not a member of Congress has been duly elected for example and in our state, whether or not a member of the legislature has been duly elected and in the case of State versus Shumate in 172 Tennessee at 451, the Court said that "It would not enter into any kind of judgment or would not enter in any kind of what judgment, it would not do anything about enforcing that type of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.677" offset="3058082">That anything that arose in regard to the qualifications of the members of the General Assembly was something that the House concerned would have to dispose of.”</text>
            <text syncTime="750.073" offset="3103640">Now, we insist that the Courts of Tennessee under that provision would not have any authority whatsoever to determine whether or not a member of the General Assembly had been duly elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.143" offset="3167901">We think that's a question that must be determined under the Constitution by the House itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.802" offset="3202591">Now, what is the significance of that proposition?</text>
            <text syncTime="780.220" offset="3224221">To us it simply means this, that if there is any question here concerning the electoral process in the State in -- with reference to the election of members of the General Assembly, then it must follow that any question which arises in regard to that election must be decided by the legislature itself and the Courts should not intrude upon the prerogatives of the legislature.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="812.459" offset="3353161">Mr. Glasgow, granting that that would be -- maybe true as respects in an elected official, does that prevent the Court of Tennessee, while the State is getting ready to hold an election, to require the State to comply with its Constitution?</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Glasgow</label>
            <text syncTime="844.309" offset="3480639">Now, in that regard, may it please the Court, we disagree with our opponents as to the effect of the Tennessee constitutional apportionment provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.704" offset="3542183">We think that the question is probably been laid to rest in Kidd versus McCanless and that being true, we think that what the Tennessee court has, at least by implication, said in regard to those provisions, is binding in this Court and on the federal courts generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.824" offset="3642702">And as was pointed out from the bench here yesterday, I think there are reported decisions of this Court where it -- it's been pointed out that although there maybe a violation of a state constitutional provision, that question must be addressed exclusively to the state court and not the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.370" offset="3752835">Now, Article II, Section 1 of our Constitution, creates three branches of Government; the executive, judicial and the legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.616" offset="3821798">The second section of our Constitution provides that, “No member of either department shall exercise the functions of the other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="941.178" offset="3868087">In other words, they must be kept separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.755" offset="3882402">Our court has adhered to that principle and in the case of Richardson versus Young, 122 Tennessee 471, the court discusses the proposition in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.641" offset="3941961">There, the Court said that the Courts are not to perform legislative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.022" offset="3983444">Now, the three apportionment provisions of our Constitution commence immediately after Section 2 and they're contained in Article II, Sections 3 through 6 inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.576" offset="4041644">Section 3 provides that the General -- that the General Assembly shall be constituted of the House of Representatives and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.822" offset="4086680">Section 4 provides for an enumeration of voters and apportionment of representatives within every subsequent term of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.828" offset="4134640">Section 5 provides for apportionment among the counties or House districts according to qualified voters not to exceed the number of 99.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.860" offset="4190856">Section 6 provides that the number of senators also to be apportioned shall never exceed one-third of the number in the House and finally, no county maybe divided in creating those districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.829" offset="4258670">Now, under the present system of Tenne -- in Tennessee, the House of Representatives is composed of 99 members and the State Senate is composed of 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.733" offset="4314258">Now, the appellants argue very strenuously that these provisions in the Tennessee Constitution are mandatory, hence, self-executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.208" offset="4376221">They insist that the 1901 apportionment statute became obsolete and invalid in 1911 because an enumeration was not made within the 10-year period as required by these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.692" offset="4462111">I will discuss Kidd versus McCanless in that respect in detail in a few moments, but if this point, suffice it to say, that we disagree with their construction and that there are a number of precedents in the state law or state decisions which hold contrary to their insistence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.006" offset="4583424">The appellants also insist that in regard to these provisions, there is a measurable discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.684" offset="4626160">These arguments of course we reject as being unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.320" offset="4640684">We think that the Court is being asked to usurp legislative functions and that the courts should assume a dominant role and make this legislature subservient to the judicial process, we think that falls squarely in teeth with the doctrine of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.953" offset="4759176">Now, again we assert that apportionment statutes as we have them in Tennessee are valid and as was suggested here yesterday, if we disregard the Tennessee constitutional provisions for the purpose of argument, the question then becomes whether or not the State legislature had the authority to enact an apportionment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.046" offset="4895535">Our court has said repeatedly that the legislature has plenary authority except as inhibited by the State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.534" offset="4949556">And we insist that the legislature of Tennessee certainly had a right to pass an apportionment statute in the absence of any constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.995" offset="5015385">The appellants also insist that there has been gross discrimination in regard to the distribution of State revenues and particularly in regard to general education appropriations and the rural roads allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.052" offset="5119561">I would like to point out to the Court that on page 209 of the records there appears what we considered to be an interesting answer to those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.272" offset="5188420">It's a very brief statement that was filed by the former Solicitor General in this cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.536" offset="5229484">One would think that the cities and the rural legislators or the city legislators and the rural legislators are constantly at each others throats and that the general education bills are always passed over the opposition of the city legislators and that the gasoline tax distribution was made over their opposition, but these -- this insert indicates that Chapter 14 of the Public Acts of 1959 which is a general appropriations law and is specially pleaded in this case, the Act was passed by the House by a vote of 81 "Aye's" 11 "No's".</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.343" offset="5432717">The 11 No's were all by representatives from rural counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.530" offset="5457481">Another -- I beg the Court's pardon that is the Rural Roads Act of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.578" offset="5493635">The General Education Law of 1950 -- 59 was passed for the Senate by a unanimous vote of 33 Aye's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.411" offset="5552985">In the House of Representatives there were 91 "Aye's" and 6 "No's".</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.307" offset="5576600">Now we think that that is an answer to some of these charges of discrimination with reference to the distribution and allocation of tax funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.421" offset="5625083">And certainly the logic of the proposition is that that must be an exclusively governmental function to be handled entirely by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.086" offset="5679731">It's just as important that the under populated rural counties have educational systems that are financed adequately as it is to have them financed adequately in the larger cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.093" offset="5763741">The record also contains the case of Kidd versus McCanless, it's at page 59 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.369" offset="5824867">That case, as found by the District Court, involved the identical facts and the identical statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.545" offset="5885576">In that case the Supreme Court of Tennessee rejected the contention that the 1901 apportionment statute became invalid in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.300" offset="5952554">Now, we insist, may it please the Court that that is tantamount to holding that those provisions are not self-executing and that they're not mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.041" offset="6007515">If they were, the Court could not have found that the Act did not expire in 1911, so we think that the doctrine of the Kidd case as decided in the state court has the effect of going against what they insist is basic in this lawsuit and that is that those provisions are mandatory and self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.926" offset="6139068">Now, the Chancellor in the court below in Kidd versus McCanless said -- overruled the demurrer that was filed to the billing chancellery and held that the statute was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.624" offset="6217853">He then fell back on the de facto doctrine and said that all of the acts which had been done by the legislative body were valid as the de facto acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.694" offset="6274173">The Court quotes at length from the Chancellor's opinion on page 62 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.051" offset="6315551">Then the court pointed out that the de facto doctrine could not apply because once the -- the legislature was declared a de facto body, then he would have no authority whatsoever to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.417" offset="6389008">And if it had no authority to act, we in substance would have no legislature in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.365" offset="6420877">That being true, the court finally declared that the ultimate result of holding this act unconstitutional by reason of the lapse of time would be to deprive us of the present legislature and the means of electing a new one and ultimately bring about the destruction of the state itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.090" offset="6511783">We submit, may it please the Court that in view of the Kidd case that the arguments -- that the Tennessee apportionment provisions in the Constitution are self-executing and mandatory are unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.332" offset="6584717">Now, what was the effect of this Court's dismissal of the appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.925" offset="6623065">Same issues were involved, same statutes were involved and we think that the force and effect of this Court's dismissal of the appeal because if there are -- were federal questions then or federal questions now, there certainly were questions then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.673" offset="6714075">We think the force and effect of that was to say that there was no substantial federal question and further that the grounds which the state court placed its judgment upon was adequate to support the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.846" offset="6794742">In the case of Maxey versus Powers in 117 Tenn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.767" offset="6814490">381, the Court was confronted with an analogous situation and it's a case which I bring to the Court's attention merely to indicate that this is not something that we have devised here on a moment's notice in the way of an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.593" offset="6893693">But there, our court was confronted with construing another provision of our Constitution regarding the laying out of civil districts and counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.216" offset="6940191">And there, the Redistricting Act was challenged as it is here and the Court said that that was a political question and it being a political question it was the type that the Court could not go into.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.236" offset="7064325">We think that the effect of the arguments in regard to the state law in this proposition is to inject this Court into political controversies in the State of Tennessee and for the federal judiciary to take over the state political situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.957" offset="7195251">We think that that would be abhorrent to our system of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.556" offset="7213641">We don't think that the basic law of our State should be disregarded and on one hand and then the appellants say, “We'll take this and leave something else.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.774" offset="7274454">We -- we think that they should be consistent throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.236" offset="7296293">We think that the ultimate effect of the courts getting into this situation would be to put the federal judiciary in the -- the situation of being on a primrose path in federal state relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.972" offset="7371212">I come now to the issue of justiciability and as we understand the rule under Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, that is always an issue in every law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.250" offset="7448325">Is a case or controversy presented within the meaning of those provisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.837" offset="7486673">We insist that the appellants have the same interest in apportionment in Tennessee as all other voters and citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.226" offset="7540276">They seek to secure to themselves representation which they say would be fairer than what we now have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.825" offset="7586670">In doing so, they have the same interest as all other citizens in a Republican Form of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.691" offset="7626167">Therefore, we insist that the complaint does not allege a private wrong and we further insist that the -- instead of accepting the allegations as pleaded in the complaint that the Court should look behind those allegations and see exactly what they're pointed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.822" offset="7718640">The substance of the matter is that they have not suffered an injury which is direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.866" offset="7754794">Further, the appellees have no real official interest in reapportionment which are different for most other state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.173" offset="7796067">And we would invite the Court's attention to page 55 of our brief, appendix (a) where we go into the question in some detail as to what the interest of these appellees maybe in regard to the electoral system in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.811" offset="7894601">First of all, the Board of Elections is composed of three men who have no other duty than to appoint the County Election Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.354" offset="7952802">They have no authority on them, they can't dismiss them, they can do nothing more than appoint them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.308" offset="7976626">They are directed by statute to meet once a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.686" offset="7998151">Next, the Attorney General is -- made a party here and it is said that he has certain duties in regard to the election of -- of state legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.516" offset="8065442">We reject the idea that he has anymore duty in that regard than he does advising any other state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.427" offset="8101073">We think that's all he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.314" offset="8112671">The idea that he does more is not founded in -- in our statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.328" offset="8132733">That being true, certainly, he could have no official entries in reappointment statutes as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.066" offset="8175679">He is required under our statutes to be made a party in the event the constitutionality of a state statute disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.906" offset="8214967">I take it, that's the primary reason that he was made a party below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.401" offset="8237014">As to the Coordinator of Elections, he has various minor duties in regard to them such as set out here on pages 58 and 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.518" offset="8297409">He has no supervision over the election, he cannot control the election, he does not conduct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.246" offset="8324368">The Secretary of State receives certificates from the County Election Commissioners as to the results that -- of the elections in those counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.752" offset="8386330">Now, we insist that that is too remote in the electoral process to be the basis of an injunction against these officials to require them to hold an election at large or to withhold -- conducting an election until the General Assembly is appointed, I mean apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.630" offset="8497925">Now, that being true in regard to their interests, we fail to see how they have any interest whatever that reaches to the critical issue of apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.573" offset="8589667">Next, we insist that the -- this is an unauthorized suit against the State because the purpose is to compel the legislature to act, not to strike down alone a statute which it enacted many years ago, but the purpose of -- of this suit goes further than that, much further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.393" offset="8712965">The purpose is to compel the legislature to reapportion the State of Tennessee and in doing that, we think that that is asked that the courts take over the electoral system and direct the legislature to do something which is beyond the power of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.676" offset="8838040">Article I, Section 17 of our Constitution inhibit suits against the State unless they have been authorized by the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.951" offset="8879208">Certainly, the General Assembly has not authorized a suit of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.447" offset="8901151">As was pointed out in Petty versus Tennessee Missouri Bridge Commission, the doctrine of governmental immunity -- immunity is strictly applied in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.447" offset="8957158">Now, that being true, we insist that these appellants as citizens of Tennessee have no standing whereby they can maintain a suit and a citizen cannot sue the State within the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment and this Court has so held on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.523" offset="9073455">Finally, I would suggest that the nature of the subject matter which General Wilson will discuss in some detail is such that the courts should not entertain this kind of a complaint and we think that the court below was eminently correct in what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.510" offset="9173452">The issues are political and they go to the part of a Republican Form of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.641" offset="9205948">We think that reapportionment is a legislative question and if the Court is without power to exercise any kind of equitable power with -- in regard to this kind of a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.032" offset="9287450">If the Court will not exercise its equity power, then we insist that is not a proper case for a declaratory judgment because the declaratory judgment statutes are procedural only and that it would be improper to make a declaration unless the Court is prepared to grant equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.534" offset="9389537">In conclusion, I would suggest that I think that it would be improper for the courts to take over the political affairs of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.447" offset="9449200">I think that in this field of federal and state relationships, it is necessary that the sovereignty of the States and their political affairs be administered by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.645" offset="9526000">I think whatever a state court may say or the State's highest court may say about its own Constitution is binding here if it's relevant at all in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.832" offset="9582738">The effect of the court's going into this questions, I suggest would be to open up many new fields of litigation and that the court then be called upon to redistrict the various municipalities throughout the country so that the people within the cities would themselves have a fair representation as is contended for here on questions for municipals annexation will the voters be given an opportunity to express themselves?</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.531" offset="9761520">We respectfully insist that all of those questions may arise in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.204" offset="9792240">If the Court goes into this area and we think that the Court should reject such a notion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.565" offset="12209612">This case is here on appeal from the three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.679" offset="12230092">A question was raised yesterday as to the duty of this Court on this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.457" offset="12273246">It is the insistence of the appellees here that this Court must consider at least three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.934" offset="12323088">One of those is whether this case is justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.847" offset="12346807">The Court must make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.216" offset="12364257">If the case is justiciable then this Court must determine whether the Federal District Court had jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.746" offset="12422353">There is, in our view, a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.135" offset="12443878">A case maybe justiciable insofar as the parties are concerned but not as to the subject matter or the Court might find that it is justiciable as to the subject matter, but the proper parties are not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.394" offset="12520991">And then a matter of great importance to the appellees and to the State of Tennessee for determination by this Court and I think perhaps the most important question if the Federal District Court has any jurisdiction is what relief, if any, maybe granted by the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.902" offset="12634990">One of the members of this Court early in the argument yesterday if I understood him, said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.265" offset="12668426">“If we determine that there is jurisdiction, need this Court concern itself with the question of relief” and the appellees say that this Court must of necessity concern itself with the question of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.685" offset="12742092">Now, General Glasgow has, in some detail, considered the question of whether the case is justiciable from the standpoint of the appellants, from the standpoint of the appellees and from the stand point of the subject matter to the extent of whether it is or is not political.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.144" offset="12851911">At this time, I wish to address myself to the subject of the nature of the subject matter of this suit insofar as jurisdiction is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.532" offset="12913455">Now, I think it goes without question that the subject matter of a lawsuit is to be determining not necessarily on some technical basis but from a practical standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.022" offset="12983463">What is the frame of the complaint in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.921" offset="13011048">Well, on the surface, on the face of it, there is an averment here of a violation of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and the civil rights statutes, but that is not the nature of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.548" offset="13085550">If the nature of the complaint was a violation of personal rights, the appellants would cite this Court, invoke some statute having to do with voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.194" offset="13164126">They do not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.332" offset="13172694">They invoked as statute having to do with representation in the legislature of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.093" offset="13215744">What does the complaint have to say or ask in the way of relief?</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.679" offset="13242075">Is it that an injunction be issued by the Federal District Court to require these appellants to permit these appellants to register?</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.683" offset="13346147">Well, a declaration as to their constitutional rights, and what else?</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.142" offset="13371956">That the next election or members legislature in the State of Tennessee be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.534" offset="13409468">That's the nature of the action, or they say that there be an election at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.583" offset="13445726">It is the appellees' contention, may it please the Court, that this case does not involve private rights, that it cannot involve private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.328" offset="13504658">We concede and very readily that there is a right under the Constitution of Tennessee for all citizens to have the type of government provided by the Constitution of Tennessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.296" offset="13824606">And I think that for whatever reasons, the Supreme Court of Tennessee may have found that to be true, we believe that this Court will and must, since it is a state right under our state constitution, accept the view of our Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.395" offset="13920946">Now, if that is true and we can do no more than to ask the Court at this stage to take our assertion that it is true then the question does not involve anything having to do with the weight of a ballot at the ballot box.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.508" offset="14013419">Now, I am aware that this Court has in the past that is to see at least two members and two members of the Court now sitting, have said that they can see no difference between a ballot cast in the -- at the ballot box, literally, metal, plastic whatever it is and the effect that that ballot has in the legislature of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.382" offset="14136926">The appellees say to this Honorable Court that that theory that that insistence, and we respect it, must in this case be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.620" offset="14189902">It must be examined microscopically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.814" offset="14206621">The case may and could turn on that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.376" offset="14248835">We think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.560" offset="14257612">It said that if a citizen cast his ballot for three state senators when he should be allowed to cast his ballot for six state senators that his right to vote has been denied, we respectfully disagree with that contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3664.493" offset="14761357">It has recognized that distinction, has consistently held from Colegrove case up to this very minute while I speak that there is a difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3744.029" offset="15079528">I invite the Court's attention to the Constitution of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.010" offset="15115368">That case has been before this Court and within recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.985" offset="15135326">Under that constitution like the Constitution of Tennessee, there is a provision almost identical saying that election shall be free and equal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3777.315" offset="15212648">Well, up there, may it please the Court, they have a specific provision in their constitution that municipality shall be entitled to extra representation in their legislature and they have said in the suit brought as I understood it, that those municipalities still didn't have the representation they should have because of malapportionment, but this Court refused to hear the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.705" offset="15334170">With that type of provision in the constitution, and Tennessee has no such provisions there, what about the Constitution of Oklahoma and that case was before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3883.167" offset="15636041">The Constitution does so provide but the plaintiffs in that case elected to bring it not in the state court but in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.947" offset="15679195">But the question is important for the reason that there, the citizens of Oklahoma had determined that the apportionment provision in that statute was either mandatory or was self-executing and that its provisions might be enforced in a court of law or equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.675" offset="15782118">And such is not true in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.791" offset="15790582">On the contrary, our court has held that it cannot enter the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.477" offset="15813256">And of course one of the questions for this Honorable Court is, “If the Supreme Court of Tennessee has held under our own constitution that it cannot enter the field, will this Court enter the field?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.449" offset="15873128">And I say to the Court that it is not only a -- a serious question and an interesting question but one of great importance in the operation of the Government of the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.075" offset="15927672">Now, I wish to discuss two additional points in the time remaining and those points, the appellees consider of utmost importance and I believe have not been touched upon up to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.116" offset="16007816">Let us assume that this Court should refuse to accept the appellees' insistence here that this is not a personal and private right under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.146" offset="16079914">Let us assume that this Court should find that this is a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.731" offset="16110320">We're assuming this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.979" offset="16119306">The appellees take the opposite view as I have said repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.359" offset="16144802">What would be the basis for -- for finding that some federal right was involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.409" offset="16192972">And of course, unless there is a federal right, this case is not -- this Court is not concerned with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.643" offset="16233932">What would the personal or private right be under the Constitution of Tennessee -- of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.371" offset="16276877">Of course, reliance has had upon the Fourteenth Amendment, but since there is no question here about voting now under our insistence, what would the right involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.785" offset="16334555">Well, necessarily, under our view, it would involve a right to equality of representation in a state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.435" offset="16381158">That would be the type of right that this Court would have to find, was protected by the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.886" offset="16430895">Now, has this Honorable Court ever so held up to this time?</text>

            <text syncTime="4089.273" offset="16460466">It has held that the right to vote for a state officer, the right of representation in a state legislative body is purely a state right.</text>

            <text syncTime="4112.493" offset="16553357">May it please the Court, this Court did hold that the right to have a vote counted at the -- the vote counted at the ballot box, and there seems to be no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.219" offset="16628276">And I would like to say and emphasize that any citizen of Tennessee who has the right to vote in a state election in Tennessee under our theory and insistence, has the right to have the vote that he puts in the ballot box counted when it's taken out of the ballot box, that most assuredly is a state right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.999" offset="16727333">Now, Your Honor has reference to the classic in Saylor cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.881" offset="16742902">Those cases involved literally a denial of the franchise at the ballot box, not in a legislative hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.519" offset="16789400">Now, returning if I may to the question here of whether that is a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.299" offset="16824613">Now, may it please the Court, if there is a federal right here as to the extent of representation in a state legislature, it arises and may arise under the frame of this complaint only by the route of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.103" offset="16907786">And I daresay that most actions laid under the Fourteenth Amendment would come -- would follow that route of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.372" offset="16960867">Now, let's get down to bad route on this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.208" offset="16976227">If there is discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment, will it bear examination?</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.005" offset="17011440">Well, you're going to have discrimination, you're going to have to treat one class different from another class, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.821" offset="17046653">Now, it's recognized in sound law that of course there maybe – classification under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.840" offset="17090748">Is there discrimination between classes where there is unequal representation in the state legislature and this case may turn on that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.131" offset="17139858">This case may turn on that very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.281" offset="17148531">We say not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.952" offset="17155218">We say that that can't be discrimination in the usual sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.601" offset="17177788">And why do I say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.772" offset="17182490">Let me give you one illustration and I think this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.303" offset="17200567">It said that according to the appellants here that if this thing goes through the ballot box.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.617" offset="17225853">We say it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.119" offset="17231809">We say it's in the legislative hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.941" offset="17247169">Now, the reason we say it can't be discrimination is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.136" offset="17271933">The effect of inadequate representation in the legislative halls has no direct casual connection with whether the person affected cast his ballot or did not cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.570" offset="17341628">Now, many of our states and some of our border states give 18-year of citizens the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.371" offset="17380812">Tennessee does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.140" offset="17391888">What is the status of a citizen in Tennessee 18 years old, 19 years old, 20 years old, who under the law of Tennessee does not have the right to vote and yet he is very greatly affected as a citizen by what the legislature does in the halls of the General Assembly of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.812" offset="17494601">Is there discrimination as to him?</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.067" offset="17511633">If so, when and where did it arise?</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.934" offset="17535143">Then the question comes up, if there's discrimination here, an unlawful discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.702" offset="17566177">Was it purposeful?</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.820" offset="17570670">Is it purposeful and intentional?</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.635" offset="17581955">Can that be shown where there is unequal -- inequitable representation when the involvement is that it's due not to an affirmative act of the legislature, but to the passage of time and shifts in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.811" offset="17654575">Now, may it please the Court, we very seriously insist that there is not and cannot be any discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.445" offset="17689161">It isn't a case involving voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.161" offset="17703999">The right to representation in a state legislature is not protected under the Fourteenth Amendment as the right to vote might be, the right to vote at polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.986" offset="17747362">We say that the Civil Rights Act is confined literally to the right to vote at the polls and that that is not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.234" offset="17792293">Now, due to the limitation in time, I must take up our final and perhaps most important, certainly, equally, important point from the standpoint of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.204" offset="17860211">Now may it please the Court, and that is the question of relief, I invite the Court's attention and I do not want this repetition to be offensive and I hope that it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.293" offset="17920502">The real party in interest in this case in Tennessee is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.224" offset="17956237">That's the legislature of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.523" offset="17969507">It's their action or their inaction of which complaint is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.236" offset="17992286">There is no complaint incidentally and I would like to emphasize it, there is no complaint as to anyone of the appellees before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.287" offset="18036485">It is averred that they have done anything, they shouldn't have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.697" offset="18062190">That it is averred when the Court gets into the case and the Tennessee law that there is anything that any of these appellees could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.236" offset="18108270">And that of course again goes to the question of whether the case is justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.694" offset="18130108">But since the legislature of Tennessee is not before this Court, either actually or figuratively, the appellees who are before the Court on behalf of the State of Tennessee do think it proper, do think it important to discuss the question of relief and certainly that would be most important if this case is sent back to the three -- three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.808" offset="18258631">Now, may it please the Court, there are three principal suggestions here as to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.682" offset="18298128">As we view the case, it will be the duty of this Court to determine whether any one of those three maybe granted or if not, whether some other possible type of relief could be granted in the event the Court finds that the District Court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.112" offset="18391855">The first subject suggested relief by the appellants here is that there be a declaration, that the apportionment statutes in Tennessee are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.834" offset="18482657">What would be the effect of a declaration by the Federal District Court at the reappor -- the apportionment statutes of Tennessee are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.911" offset="18547022">We connected -- the appellees connected with the government of the state of Tennessee, take the position that the effect would be and must of necessity be that the government of the State of Tennessee is operating unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.021" offset="18643466">I submit that there could be no other reasonable conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.051" offset="18675545">The Federal District Court let it say, makes that declaration and as its decree, what does the State of Tennessee and its government can do?</text>

            <text syncTime="5705.042" offset="22923577">Commencing with the apology of the parliament of King James, the legislatures have consistently been held to be the exclusive judge of the qualification of their members and the de facto only applies, it's -- it's never applied to anyone except some official elected to some office and the question then of whether he's properly elected or whether his office is properly created.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.295" offset="23032560">The courts do pass upon that but they do not pass upon the question of -- of a seat in the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5742.598" offset="23073729">So, if General Wilson should be asked whether to go ahead and execute this prisoner and he's smart, I know him well enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="5811.759" offset="23350418">Mr. Chief Justice and -- and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.304" offset="23364629">I listened very careful to my distinguished adversaries here to see if they could utter one word in defense of the factual discrimination which exists in this case and I failed to hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.389" offset="23448952">I think there can be no question but what's the right to vote is created by the State of Tennessee and we don't challenge that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.691" offset="23506108">We say that when that right is created, it must be given to everyone in equality under the measurable equality set forth in the Constitution of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.112" offset="23567862">And that if anyone is discriminated against, by then, that the right to vote is a part of their civil rights and the Fourteenth Amendment comes into play and we have that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.408" offset="23621047">We do not believe that -- that any state can invade a federally protected right and so keep it completely destroyed or nullified or -- or eliminated or that all relief is blocked forever such as the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.513" offset="23713416">And I also call the Court's attention to the fact that the -- the Saylor case which was referred to here in five ballot box stuffing, not just counting ballots but stuffing ballot boxes so that -- that votes were deluded so it's -- it's right in point with this, what I would call ballot-box rigging here so that one man's vote is worth only a tenth or a twentieth of another man's vote and I say that there can be no question but what that is discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5936.283" offset="23848521">I say there can be no question but what under the Civil Rights Act, the right to vote is protected, that it is a civil right and that it is a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.848" offset="23894810">I was quite surprised to -- to hear it argued that the -- that the right to vote is -- is not a personal right, why, certainly it's a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.485" offset="23925321">And it's been held so in Herndon versus Nixon and all other cases that I've ever read involving the right to vote in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.765" offset="23962415">So, we say that the State of Tennessee has no power in this 1901 Act or in any other to -- to nullify a federally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.028" offset="24011525">We say that here we're asking this Court which is under our system of checks and balances, the ultimate safeguard of individual rights of civil liberties in this country to carry out its duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.526" offset="24073488">The legislature of the State of Tennessee is not the ultimate safeguard of individual civil rights under the Constitution of the United States of America, this Court and the federal courts and all courts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.418" offset="24121031">And so, we say that the right to vote is such a civil right and that it is protected under the Fourteenth Amendment and we would sum up our case in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.161" offset="24168051">We have here 11 voters who have been given a right in Tennessee to vote in equality with all other voters similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.834" offset="24226670">And the State of Tennessee has, through this Act of -- of 1901, taken away their right of equality and given them a one-twentieth or one-tenth of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.436" offset="24289155">And so, when all other avenues of relief are blocked, we ultimately must come here, we're at the end of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.794" offset="24334503">There cannot be a judicial no man's land where civil rights are involved in the United States of America and that is what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.688" offset="24382151">And this Court in Smiley versus Holm and in case after case has always held that the right to vote of an American is important, that it is a personal right and then it cannot be taken away by any action of any state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.664" offset="24454040">So therefore, we believe that these individual voters have a -- a right which under these facts have been taken away and we ask this Court to do as courts have from time immemorial, reverse and remand this case to the District Court with the instructions to provide a remedy that is adequate to the protection of the right that is here before the Court and which Tennessee has deluded and destroyed.</text>
