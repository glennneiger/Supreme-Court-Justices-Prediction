            <text syncTime="1100.102" offset="4503803">You are concerned only with whether or not that legislation fits within the framework of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.060" offset="4531597">When you strike it down, the problem, it does not disappear, we still have it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.022" offset="4711424">The Court recognizes what happens when legislation is stricken down but Mr. Bilgrey said yesterday, "They are not -- have you have no problems at all."</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.812" offset="4758653">And to answer you, Mr. Justice Douglas, I feel that there is a vast difference between movies and the Chicago Tribune.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.716" offset="4798255">I wanted to say the -- the Gitlow case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.274" offset="4816436">The Gitlow case is a landmark decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.141" offset="4835976">The Gitlow case stands with the proposition that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a State from abridging the freedom of speech of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.811" offset="4886653">Up until that time, this Court have never so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.497" offset="4901386">But what else was said in the Gitlow case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.493" offset="4913298">And incidentally in that case, as the Court knows, the legislation there with which the Court was concerned was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.187" offset="4940152">Its validity was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.874" offset="4950915">And incidentally, it concerned anarchist, people intending to overthrow the Government, which takes us back to the comment that the Court of Appeals made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.941" offset="4995114">But in the Gitlow case, the -- this Court said, in substance that it cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonable when in the exercise of its judgment as to measures necessary to the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark, extinguish it before it has enkindled the flame or blazed into conflagration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.959" offset="5099186">What do they mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.642" offset="5105977">They mean what we're trying to do here, we have a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.561" offset="5121651">Now, if this was a Pollyanna type movie, as Mr. Bilgrey has intimated, then first of all, he is committed to fraud upon this Court in going through this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.027" offset="5163447">I'm assuming this is a type of a movie that we would reject and that's the reason he would not bring it into us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.564" offset="5189674">The movie industry is not here today for the purpose of protecting the freedom of speech of the individuals of this country, that maybe the result if you agree with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.341" offset="5228753">They are here today for the right to exhibit a movie called "Don Juan".</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.318" offset="5248606">That's what they want.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.157" offset="5272012">If you agree with them in the future to exhibit any -- anyway, pornographic or other one, there is great profit in movies which are obscene or pornographic.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.177" offset="5352051">It's a great industry but there are people in the industry as there are in every business who maybe attempting to force upon the public obscene, pornographic movies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.190" offset="12528097">I think there -- there's a serious question that must be decided by this Court before they get to the merits of this case namely, whether or not the ordinance is constitutional in regard to prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.877" offset="12610853">Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that there was no justiciable controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.127" offset="12655888">The District Court proceeded on the theory that the petitioner should submit the film to the commissioner of police because otherwise -- or if he did and if it was found not objectionable, the license would have issued and then there would have been no litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.257" offset="12752436">The Circuit Court of Appeals took a slightly different slant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.242" offset="12772289">Circuit Court of Appeals said, "We cannot decide this case in the vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.775" offset="12806457">We must see the movie to determine whether or not it is obscene."</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.364" offset="12856822">Counsel for the petitioner attempts to answer these contentions and I say that the ordinance is unconstitutional especially that portion of the ordinance that requires him to submit the movie prior to the time of showing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.616" offset="12953788">And his basis seems to be limited to the contention that the ordinance is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.626" offset="13009899">In my opinion, he is predetermining the very issue that is before this Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="4083.137" offset="16435911">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.027" offset="16451480">Let me first address myself to this procedural question that has arisen which I think is best exemplified by Justice Stewart's question as to what would have been the easiest way to raise this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.810" offset="16506650">It would not have been possible in our opinion to go ahead and show the movie and then defend against the prosecution under this ordinance on the ground that we will deny the movie -- we were denied the permit because of obscenity because that kind of a defense ignores two other sections of this ordinance which we think or at least we're not prepared to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.189" offset="16600168">One is a revenue section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.111" offset="16607796">The city gets quite a bit of revenue out of this ordinance, 1553 provides for permit fees and transfer permit fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.002" offset="16647398">And the second is a registration section of this ordinance which we are not challenged which requires each subsequent transferee to advise the city as to what theater the picture is playing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.131" offset="16691911">Now, as far as I can see, either of those or both of those are perfectly, constitutionally valid so that if we came in and tried to defend against a prosecution for refusing to have a permit, a court, whether it was state or federal, would be perfectly justified in saying to us, "Look here, you may be right but you have no right to ignore these other constitutional sections of the ordinance and therefore, you cannot ignore the licensing procedure."</text>

            <text syncTime="5619.198" offset="22580120">In the latter situation, all the familiar procedural safeguards come in to play while in the other instance, there are no procedural safeguards and communication is choked off at the threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.172" offset="22624110">Now, I'm quoting from page 37 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.804" offset="22634559">As I say this was a case where they reversed the censor board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.171" offset="22648038">Significantly, I might add, the other function, the demonstrations of the functions of the censors is indicated from our appendix where every single decision of there banning a picture since Burstyn has been reversed if the -- the Senate were to be alarmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5656.463" offset="22729226">Would the Declaration of Independence or the Gettysburg Address have been as effective if it has been made five years later?</text>

            <text syncTime="5669.432" offset="22781053">This case has been going on two and a half year, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.476" offset="22793279">The subject matter of American Civil Liberties Union versus City of Chicago was the miracle, the same picture involved in the Burstyn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.151" offset="22820028">It took five years to clear that picture under this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.741" offset="22834343">And significantly, it never did show in the City of Chicago.</text>
