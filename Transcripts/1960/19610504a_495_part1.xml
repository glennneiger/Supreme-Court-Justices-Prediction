            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="15.865" offset="166849">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.092" offset="187747">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.552" offset="197569">This case is here on certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York sustaining the action of New York's Industrial Commissioner in determining that the petitioners are not subject to taxation under New York's Unemployment Insurance Law and in refusing to accept further tax payments from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.010" offset="295372">In reaching its decision, the court below passed on the interpretation and constitutionality of Section 3 of the Communist Control Act and the validity of the respondent's action under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.132" offset="379904">The case presents the paradox of two taxpayers, the petitioners here, who are resisting a tax exemption which the tax collector, the respondent here, insists on thrusting upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.025" offset="443434">I think therefore at the outset I should perhaps indicate why it is that the position of the petitioners is far from quixotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.282" offset="484498">The action of the respondent injures them in two different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.135" offset="507904">In the first place, it triples their aggregate -- aggregate liability for unemployment insurance taxes under the system of interrelated state and federal unemployment insurance taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.107" offset="567777">This is so, because the state exemption relieves them of taxation at the rate of only seven tenths of 1% of their payrolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.301" offset="608528">While at the same time, it deprives them of a credit under the federal tax law and increases their federal tax tempo from three tenths of 1% to 3% of their payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.136" offset="671953">The respondent does not dispute that his action had this consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.021" offset="691493">And I spell out the details of the operation of the interrelated tax laws in -- in my brief at pages 6 and 8 -- 6 to 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.014" offset="731408">In the second place, the respondent's action handicaps petitioner in -- petitioners in securing and retaining employees by making it doubtful at this whether their employees are covered by unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.478" offset="805282">The facts are that for 20 years following the enactment of New York's Unemployment Insurance Law, the petitioners were taxed under it and their employees enjoyed the coverage of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.148" offset="859930">In January 1957, the Attorney General of New York, responding to an inquiry from the Industrial Commissioner, issued an opinion, which appears as Appendix B to my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.718" offset="918235">The opinion ruled that petitioners are not taxable under and that their employees are not covered by the Unemployment Insurance Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.309" offset="972570">-- Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.035" offset="975496">None at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.674" offset="978108">And that -- and I'll -- I'll point out at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.537" offset="993468">The Attorney General did not rely on any provision of the Unemployment Insurance Law itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.028" offset="1019486">The ground for his conclusion was that petitioners are engaged in a criminal conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States and the State of New York by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.418" offset="1065044">And therefore, in the words of the Attorney General, and I quote them, "It would be an anomaly in law not to say a moral and against public policy for the Communist Party and its employees to enjoy the advantages and benefits of this public insurance program."</text>
            <text syncTime="256.635" offset="1129932">Those were the sole grounds on which the Attorney General rested his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.866" offset="1150830">Acting pursuant to this opinion, the respondent, the Industrial Commissioner denied the application of one Albertson for insurance benefits based upon his employment by the Communist Party of the United States, one of the petitioners whom I refer to as the National Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.758" offset="1222405">The Industrial Commissioner also notified both the National and the State Party, both of the petitioners here, that he had suspended their registrations as employers liable to unemployment insurance contributions and that they should make no further contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.428" offset="1289070">I should explain at this point that the term "contribution" is used in the state law to denote the tax which the law levies on employers' unaccountable wages which the employers pay to their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.447" offset="1349151">And registration is simply an administrative device which the respondent, the Industrial Commissioner uses to identify employers who are liable for contributions for collection and accounting purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.185" offset="1420100">Both Albertson, the claimant for unemployment insurance, and the petitioner appeal the rulings of the Industrial Commissioner to an Unemployment Insurance Referee who consolidated the three cases for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.470" offset="1477256">The respondent offered no evidence of the hearing but rested solely on the opinion of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.372" offset="1504841">The only evidence with respect to the nature of petitioners' activities was a testimony of Albertson that his duty is consisted in studying trends in the labor movement and analyzing proposed labor legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.327" offset="1568684">The Referee sustained the determinations of the Industrial Commissioner not on the Attorney General's criminal conspiracy theory but under Section 3 of the Communist Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.272" offset="1624482">Section 3 provides "that whatever rights, privileges and immunities which have heretofore been granted to said party," that is the Communist Party, "or any subsidiary organization by reason of the laws of United States or any political subdivision thereof are hereby terminated."</text>
            <text syncTime="400.802" offset="1706611">The Referee held that this Section terminated the rights of petitioners to have employees and therefore extinguish their liability to taxation as employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.965" offset="1759274">The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board affirmed, the appellate division refers unanimously holding that Section 3 did not terminate petitioners' liability to taxation as employers or the right of their employees to unemployment insurance coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.931" offset="1835133">A divided Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the appellate division as to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.456" offset="1861151">Let's say holding the petitioners who are not liable to taxation under the Unemployment Insurance Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.153" offset="1884035">However, it affirmed the decision that Albertson was entitled to insurance coverage based on his employment by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.110" offset="1919770">The Court handed down three separate opinions, two judges joining in each.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.729" offset="1942340">The seventh member of the Court did not participate because he had been the presiding justice -- presiding judge rather in the appellate division when the case was heard there.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.154" offset="1984031">The prevailing opinion which was -- which was written by Chief Justice Desmond construes Section 3 of the Communist Control Act as terminating petitioners' status as employers under the state law for -- as Judge Desmond said, "For whatever value that status may have".</text>
            <text syncTime="488.628" offset="2057906">The opinion holds that Section 3 as so construed as constitution -- constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.501" offset="2089357">As to Albertson, however, Judge Desmond ruled that since his employment by the Communist Party antedated the action of the Industrial Commissioner, although it was subsequent to the enactment of the Communist Control Act, it would be unreasonably punitive to deny him his insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.741" offset="2170337">The second opinion written by Judge Van Voorhis agrees with the prevailing opinion as to the construction and constitutionality of Section 3 of the Communist Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.106" offset="2215790">It holds however that since Section 3 deprived petitioners of the capacity to be employers and to enter into an employer-employee relationship, Albertson wasn't entitled to this insurance because he wasn't an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.970" offset="2279215">The dissenting opinion by Judge Fuld holds that Section 3 did not terminate petitioners' liability to taxation under the state law or the right of their employees to unemployment insurance coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.700" offset="2330206">Now, in as much as the judgment of the state court turned on the construction of a federal statute, I think that perhaps it was appropriate to start my discussion with an examination of the construction which has been given to Section 3 by the federal agencies having primary responsibility for the interpretation and enforcement of this federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.763" offset="2426441">When President Eisenhower signed the Communist Control Act in August of 1954, he stated that its full impact would require further careful study.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.040" offset="2471581">It seems apparent that such study, or any case -- apparently not such study has resulted in no action of any kind by the federal authorities to apply Section 3's fiat deprivation of rights, privileges and immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.770" offset="2538454">No action of any kind has been taken by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.083" offset="2551724">Furthermore, this has been inherent from the inception of this proceeding that the Bureau of Internal Revenue rejects the construction given to Section 3 by the respondent here and by the Court of Appeals of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.289" offset="2608567">For as the evidence showed and as both of the state courts found, the Bureau has continued to tax the petitioner as employers under the Federal Unemployment Insurance -- Unemployment Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.453" offset="2661230">That -- this is the position not only the Bureau of Internal Revenue, but also the Department of Justice is established by the letter from the Solicitor General to the Clerk of this Court declining to intervene or file an amicus brief in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.556" offset="2721625">The letter states, and I quote it, "There is no need to file a brief describing the practice of federal agencies in interpreting the statute for this information is already set forth in the opinion of Judge Fuld in the Court of Appeals."</text>
            <text syncTime="671.203" offset="2788185">Judge Fuld, of course, wrote the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.105" offset="2799783">And the Solicitor General's reference as to a passage from that opinion which first restates the respondent's contention that Section 3 terminated the petitioners' status as employers and their liability for unemployment insurance, and then continues as follows, and I quote just few sentences from Judge Fuld's opinion, "This contention, referring to the respondent's contention, is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.936" offset="2903124">In the first place, it is significant that the federal authorities, admittedly aware of the Industrial Commissioner's position, have taken one diametrically opposed and continued to recognize the Communist Party as an employer subject to the Federal Act."</text>

            <text syncTime="736.661" offset="3050036">And -- and the Solicitor General's letter which was written to the Court on the April 10th, a few weeks ago, states flatly that the federal -- the interpretation of the Act by the federal agencies is, that is, the Communist Control Act, is that it has no effect on -- on their taxability under the Federal Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.431" offset="3133106">The -- the -- that -- that follows from the reference of Judge Fuld's opinion, which I have just read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.789" offset="3162572">The correctness of the federal interpretation of Section 3 as well as what Judge Fuld characterized as the unreasonableness of the respondent's position will appear from an examination of the text of the statute of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.624" offset="3221817">First, however, I think it is an order to give the Court a very brief résumé of the legislative history of this extraordinary piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.648" offset="3265912">The Communist Control Act was passed in August 1954 during the closing days of the 83rd Congress just before Congress adjourned for the congressional elections and national elections of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.702" offset="3318157">It originated in Senator Butler's bill to amend the Internal Security Act by adding provisions with reference to so-called "Communist-infiltrated organizations".</text>
            <text syncTime="815.634" offset="3365909">In the course of the Senate debate, Senator Humphrey offered an amendment in the form of an addition to the bill which was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.043" offset="3403525">The Court will perhaps recall from the discussion in the Noto and Scales cases in this term that the heart of the Humphrey Amendment appeared as Section 3 of the Senate Bill and made membership in the Communist Party a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.709" offset="3466219">Now, the House rejected Section 3 of the Senate Bill when it was advised that that -- the Section in that form would jeopardize the registration provisions of the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.777" offset="3518464">It substituted for the Senate version of Section 3, the text of Section 3, which now appears in the Act, the deprivation of rights, privileges and immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.944" offset="3563186">There was no Committee consideration of this Section either in the House or in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.014" offset="3583457">Representative Celler, who, at that time, was the senior minority member of the House Judiciary Committee, described the situation in the House in the following words, and I quote, "The Judiciary Committee never saw the instant bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.155" offset="3639986">It was cropped up over the weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.372" offset="3648867">It was cut and recut, furbished and refurbished, shuffled and reshuffled.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.698" offset="3670183">It is indeed a hodgepodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.199" offset="3680214">Now, we are in a way buying a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="898.093" offset="3695783">What does this field really entails?</text>
            <text syncTime="900.830" offset="3706650">Nobody really knows."</text>
            <text syncTime="903.312" offset="3716577">A reading of the debates fully confirms Representative Celler's statement through a number of congressmen asserted their personal opinions as to what Section 3 meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.375" offset="3772897">These comments, of course, would be of no weight even if they were consistent with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.448" offset="3793168">But in this instance, they were mutually contradictory consisting of Senator Morse observed, and I quote him, "of almost every possible conflicting point of view which human minds can imagine or can cut".</text>
            <text syncTime="937.936" offset="3855130">But the legislative history does therefore and about all that it does is to document Senator, chief author's comment, and I quote him, "That we are giving a clear and impressive picture of how legislation should not be written."</text>
            <text syncTime="953.485" offset="3917302">Nevertheless, one fact emerges from the text of Section 3 and from the legislative history, certainly, whatever else Congress may have intended by that Section's deprivation of rights, it certainly did not intend to relieve the Communist Party of its liabilities and least of all of its liabilities of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.699" offset="4006118">Two members of the Court of Appeals and a unanimous appellate division so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.904" offset="4030986">Now, they are holding as reinforced, I think, by the cases that respondent cites in his brief, the familiar cases to the effect that an activity otherwise taxable is not relieved from the taxation because the activity is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.748" offset="4094412">For -- under these decisions, petitioner would not have been exempt from employment taxes on the wages they pay even if Section 3 had done which it -- what it doesn't and the terms prohibited the petitioners from having employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.026" offset="4159509">The respondent argues nevertheless that the obligation to pay employment taxes arises only from the exercise of a legal right, the legal right to be an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.195" offset="4208201">His contention is that Section 3 terminated this legal right of petitioners and therefore extinguished their common liability to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.694" offset="4254177">This contention rests first of all on the proposition that the unemployment insurance tax is a tax on the exercise of a legal right to employ others and not simply on the existence of a de facto employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.115" offset="4319796">It's unnecessary to -- I think to discuss this rather metaphysical distinction for it is clear that Section 3 does not terminate petitioners' legal right to be employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.976" offset="4367235">This is two or three distinct reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.994" offset="4391372">First, Section 3 does not purport to terminate all of the petitioners' rights but only those, and I quote Section 3, "which have heretofore been granted by reason of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof".</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.245" offset="4460335">Now, the right of a natural person to employ others is not a right granted by Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.317" offset="4480606">On the contrary, it is a natural or inherent right, one of the inalienable rights with which, as a declaration of -- of independents declares, all men are endowed by their creator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.449" offset="4537135">And as the declaration also teaches, such rights are not granted by Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.561" offset="4561586">On the contrary, Governments were instituted among men to secure such rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.445" offset="4585200">Consequently, if petitioners were natural persons, their right to be employers would not be affected by Section 3 which terminates only rights granted by Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.651" offset="4630026">Now, the fact is that petitioners are unincorporated associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.102" offset="4647790">And in New York, an unincorporated association is not an entity like a corporation which owes its franchise to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.379" offset="4684884">As Chief Judge Desmond does squarely held in another and earlier case, an unincorporated association, and I quote him, "is not an artificial person and has no existence independent of its members".</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.443" offset="4741099">Accordingly, the right that is involved here is a right to petitioners' members collectively to employ others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.981" offset="4775267">That would be true in the case of a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.015" offset="4787388">That right is as much of an inherent right as a right of a single individual to be an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.523" offset="4809435">And hence, it's not a right which Section 3 purports to terminate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.103" offset="5851826">There are only two possible bases for the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.634" offset="5865932">The one that's emphasized most, and it's perfectly explicit, is Section 3 of the Communist Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.661" offset="5885994">Now, it maybe, and there are some indications both in the opinion and certainly in their remittitur that the Court was saying also that quite a part from Section 3 of the Communist Control Act, we think that this was proper state action but somehow or another, the Attorney General had the power to -- to render the opinion that he did and the Industrial Commissioner had the power to -- to do what he did without any authorization, any specific authorization by the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.589" offset="5993723">Whether -- whether the Court really meant that or not, I don't know, but that -- that maybe a possible interpretation of their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.199" offset="6024129">And that's how the Fourteenth Amendment question quips into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.938" offset="6047117">Now, in the second place, and I'm again -- I'm still addressing myself to the -- the question of statutory interpretation as to whether Section 3 terminates the right of the Communist Party to be an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.788" offset="6102497">And my second point in that connection is that even if the right of the petitioners here to be employers as a right granted by Government rather than a natural or inherent right, it's a right granted by New York and not by the United States and is, therefore, not affected by Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.682" offset="6174072">Section 3 purports to terminate all rights granted by petitioners, and I quote, "by reason of the laws of the Unites States or any political subdivision thereof".</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.839" offset="6218689">As my brief shows, the States are not political subdivisions of the United States within any accepted meaning of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.631" offset="6249932">In addition, both the Communist Control Act and elsewhere, the Congress has shown that understands the distinction between a political subdivision and the State and doesn't use one term when it means the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.962" offset="6303222">Additionally, a ruling that Section 3 applies to all rights grant of petitioners by state law is to be avoided because it would give rise to a great constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.179" offset="6356093">Congress, of course, may not regulate much less prohibited the exercise of a right which is unrelated to the execution of one of its granted powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.496" offset="6393396">For example, Congress would seem clearly to lack the competence to prohibit the petitioners from implying a man to do the job that Albertson, the claimant, had been performing in this case as to say to study trends in the labor movement and analyze proposed labor legislation, not be within the competence of Congress to prohibit the employment of a man for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.842" offset="6502693">It appears, therefore, that constitutional considerations applicable to employment like this militate against any interpretation of Section 3 making it applicable to all rights granted under state laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.746" offset="7022320">Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.425" offset="7033083">Now, on the third place, I think it's evident from the tax of the Communist Control Act as a whole that Congress did not intend to terminate the right of the Communist Party to be an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.603" offset="7077804">But on the contrary, contemplated that the Party would continue to have and to act through employees notwithstanding Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.812" offset="7114585">I discussed the relevant provisions of the Communist Control Act in my brief and shan't repeat the analysis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.182" offset="7144051">Thus, for the three reasons I've indicated, the tax of the Communist Control Act refused the respondent's interpretation of Section 3 and supports that of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.995" offset="7195355">Moreover, Congress acquiesced in the federal -- in the federal interpretation in 1956 when it enacted comprehensive amendments to the Social Security Act and the Insurance Contributions Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.453" offset="7253138">Before discussing these amendments, I should say that the Bureau of Internal Revenue has continued to tax the petitioners, the Communist Parties, as employers under the Insurance Contributions Act as well as under the Unemployment Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.012" offset="7323460">Furthermore, subsequent to the enactment of the Communist Control Act, and prior to the passage of these 1956 Social Security Act amendments, a Social Security administration referee ruled that the -- that employees of the petitioners are entitled to old-age benefits based on their employment by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.096" offset="7415724">Now, if Congress had thought that the Bureau and the Referee were wrong and that Section 3 had terminated the petitioners' liability to social security taxation and the right of their employees to coverage, it could have rectified the error when it enacted the comprehensive 1956 amendments to the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.587" offset="7497749">Instead, Congress adopted amendments which are wholly consistent with the federal interpretation of Section 3 of the Communist Control Act, that is to say that that Section doesn't affect petitioners' liability to employment taxes, for what the amendments do is to exclude from social security coverage and taxations services in the employee of an organization subsequent to the date on which it is finally ordered to register under the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.426" offset="7625122">Thus, as far as the social security amendments are concerned, the petitioner and its employees are not presently accepted from coverage either tax, that is, petitioners from taxation and their employees from old-age benefits, and they will not be accepted from coverage unless the Communist Party of the United States is finally ordered to register under the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.303" offset="7724596">That seems pretty obvious that Congress would have not -- would not have adopted this amendment unless an agreement with the interpretation given Section 3 by the federal agencies, it believed that that Section have not affected the petitioners' liability to taxation as employers or the right of their employees to social insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.284" offset="7808502">So much for the question of the interpretation of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.560" offset="7825638">Of course, should the Court reject the federal interpretation of the Section and the arguments that I advance would be obliged to pay something to the underlying constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.529" offset="7873494">I discussed these in my brief, and I don't propose to dwell on them now except to outline them very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.084" offset="7903692">On its face and as applied, Section 3 violates the Constitution in a number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.941" offset="7927097">First, it denies the petitioners' substantive due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.572" offset="7953638">The evil with which the Communist Control Act purports the deal, as stated in Section 2, is conduct of the Communist Party said to endanger the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.238" offset="7996374">There's a long recital of these dangers in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.834" offset="8010689">But Section 3 is not restricted to measures for the prohibition or control of such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.371" offset="8036812">On its face and as construed below, it terminates the right of the Party to engage through employees or otherwise in an entirely peaceable and innocent activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.889" offset="8086967">Hence, Section 3 violates the due process principle, which -- as Mr. Justice Frankfurter wants to put it, prohibits legislation from throwing a baby out of the bath or burning down the house to roast the pig.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.593" offset="8141720">Section 3 also denies petitioners' procedural due process because it deprives them of valuable rights and privileges on the charge made in Section 2 that they are criminal conspirators without according them a hearing in the truth of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.980" offset="8207339">Next, Section 3 is both a bill of attainder and an ex post facto law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.553" offset="8229595">The controlling question here is whether the Section imposes punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.464" offset="8257181">Section 2 of the Act finds the Communist Party by name to be guilty of seditious conspiracy and declares that it should be outlawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.678" offset="8298036">The deprivation of rights which Section 3 decrees is absolute and permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.155" offset="8319979">No escape from it is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.295" offset="8328547">Impeccable future conduct by the Party will not restore the rights which Section 3 denies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.902" offset="8367000">Furthermore, since Section 3 scripts the petitioners of all of their rights indiscriminately, it is clear that the legislation was aimed at them and not at any particular conduct or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.476" offset="8425305">Finally, a glance at the House and Senate debates is enough to dispel any possible doubt that the purpose of the legislation was punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.291" offset="8464488">Indeed, Section 3 has every one of the indicia of punishment to which this Court has adverted in the line of cases from Cummings against Missouri to Flemming versus Nestor of the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.101" offset="8531780">The final constitutional infirmity of Section 3 I've already indicated as applied below, it is unconstitutional because it terminates rights not within the competence of Congress to affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.282" offset="8588518">In conclusion, I should like to say just a few more words on the Fourteenth Amendment question which works in the case in which I've discussed briefly in answer to a question from Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.179" offset="8636061">It's in the case because there are several vague indications in the prevailing opinion below that the action of the Industrial Commissioner could be sustained, I think this is what the opinion says, I'm not sure, could be sustained as state action without regard to the Communist Control Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.819" offset="8710666">Well, page 38, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.344" offset="8724773">There's one indication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.228" offset="8732296">The Court says, the appellate division recognized in its opinion that the State might, by appropriate steps, prevent the Communist Parties from engaging in any activity or existence.We think that the State of New York has already done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.779" offset="8790497">Now, I don't -- they're not -- they don't tell you very clearly as to what the State of New York -- how the State of New York had done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.416" offset="8813066">All I say is, the Attorney General, the highest law officer, argues to us in this appeal that the unemployment insurance officers acted validly in denying for the recognition of the Communist Parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.351" offset="8860818">Then, in addition to that statement, the facts that the Court distinguishes or -- or says rather that Albertson is entitled of this insurance because his employment occurred before the action taken by the Industrial Commissioner would seem to indicate that the Court was relying on something that the Industrial Commissioner did rather merely -- and merely on Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.871" offset="8954859">And in any event, the Court in its remittitur states that it had decided that respondent's action didn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.848" offset="8998745">So, apparently, somehow or another it considered this as a matter of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.070" offset="9019643">Now, my brief shows that if -- if the respondent's action is viewed as state action, its -- his action must rest on the criminal conspiracy theory that was advanced by the Attorney General on this opinion, that is to the Communist Party as a criminal conspiracy and therefore behave more against public policy permits it and its employees to enjoy the benefits of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.313" offset="9116609">And my brief also shows that this theory contravenes the due process and equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.891" offset="9146911">Now, the respondent's brief contains a lengthy defense of the -- this criminal conspiracy theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.410" offset="9173034">But it states that respondent relies solely on Section 3 of the Federal Act of a justification for his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.408" offset="9205008">Now, if the Court accepts the respondent's concession, then no state action is involved here and the Fourteenth Amendment question drops out of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.462" offset="13765256">[Laughter] I -- I'm quite satisfied that so strong was the basis of the Communist Control Act for the decision of the Court of Appeals, and I am willing to attempt to support the Court of Appeals in its determination on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.510" offset="13845400">Now, turning to a consideration of the impact of the Communist Control Act, we find, first, recognition of the adherent illegality of the Communist Party in the clause of Section 3 which states that the Communist Party is not entitled to any of the rights, privileges and immunities which are attendant to -- for illegal bodies created under the jurisdiction of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.714" offset="13950203">Now, the title of the Section and the opening clause referred to "the Communist Party, its successors and subsidiary organizations".</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.101" offset="13987819">Now, this language, standing alone, is broad enough to include the communist parties of the various States and territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.933" offset="14019062">However, if there is any doubt in connection with this matter, reference maybe had to Section 4 (b) of the Act wherein the term Communist Party is defined as, "The organization now known as the Communist Party of the United States, the Communist Party of any State or subdivision thereof and any unit or subdivision of any such organization, whether or not any changes hereafter made in the name thereof."</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.339" offset="14132746">Now, the petitioners assert that the Act does not affect rights, privileges and immunities which arise under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.776" offset="14166497">They distinguish between the opening clause of Section 3 which refers to the Government of the United States or the Government of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof and the two later clauses which deal with non-entitlement and termination of the rights created on the jurisdiction "of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof."</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.354" offset="14268792">From this, they conclude that Congress demonstrated its recognition of the distinction between a political subdivision and a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.108" offset="14303796">And that Congress intended by this shorthand reference to affect only jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and federal territories and possessions which are political subdivisions of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.320" offset="14364609">Now, in the first place, I might observe that in Casey against Boldt, 1946 decision of this Court, there was established, the rule of statutory interpretation that the mere absence of the word "State" in a federal statute does not exclude applicability of -- of that statute to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.446" offset="14441200">Secondly, it was quite clearly the intent of Congress to include in the last two phrases dealing with non-entitlement and termination of the rights in shorthand form, the same political entities as were included in detail in the opening phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.020" offset="14511417">This is apparent form the context of the latter two phrases in which the political entities which are referred to are entities which have lawmaking powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.809" offset="14558647">Certainly, the District of Columbia and many of the federal possessions do not have independent or sovereign lawmaking powers under which corporations may be formed and under which statutory rights, privileges and immunities may arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.885" offset="14622908">Laws for the district in such possessions were enacted generally by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.821" offset="14642657">A State, on the other hand, has independent sovereign lawmaking powers in the respect which I have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.241" offset="14676302">Confining the meaning of political subdivision in the last clause to the district and the federal possessions is furthermore illogical because these two were specifically referred to in the first clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.185" offset="14732100">The more logical conclusion seems to be that in the first clause, the word "political subdivisions" referred to local subdivisions or units within the States and territories while the words "political subdivision" as used in the last clause, which terminates the rights of the Communist Party includes "States".</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.204" offset="14816214">Congressional intent too, as evidenced by senatorial comments which appeared in the congressional record during the debates when this Act was a bill, would appear to indicate that the Act was expected, one, to deny the party a place on the ballot, two, to deprive it of contractual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.616" offset="14897821">Both of which depend on state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.446" offset="14913181">According to the argument of counsel for the parties, the Act does apply to Hawaii and Alaska because at the time of its enactment, they were territories of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.116" offset="14963858">Does this -- does he now claim that since these territories have attained statehood that the law no longer applies to them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.403" offset="14993011">And if it is -- and if it is admitted as it must be, that the law continues to apply to them, what happens to the principle that all States were admitted to the union upon an equal footing?</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.046" offset="15035538">It seems also obvious from the context of the Section as a whole that the laws, the benefit of which the petitioners have lost, are necessarily the laws of the governments, federal, State and territorial, which the petitioners threaten to overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.945" offset="15107114">The fine splitting of hairs and the raising of the straw issue of whether the nation was made from the State or the State from the nation cannot obscure this intent which is so clearly expressed on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.971" offset="15159254">Counsel also points out that Section 3 does not --</text>

            <text syncTime="3823.395" offset="15396968">Now, I -- I was about to discuss the fact that the petitioners make the point that Section 3 does not purport to terminate all of their rights but only those which are heretofore been granted by reason of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.831" offset="15462693">And they emphasized the word "granted".</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.705" offset="15474186">They then assert that natural persons possess an inherent right to employ others, and they conclude that if the petitioners were natural persons, their rights would not be among the rights which are terminated by the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.565" offset="15533641">But the fact of the matter is that this conclusion is based upon an erroneous premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.720" offset="15554226">Although not considered legal entities of common law, unincorporated associations have been statutorily invested with certain powers and capacities which stamped them unquestionably as artificial entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.976" offset="15611277">They have, in some instances, been given power to act in their own names, in others, they may still act through natural persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.943" offset="15647117">However, even in the latter cases, the natural persons do not act in their own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.059" offset="15667597">They are merely the conduits for the effectuation of the purpose which is sought to be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.309" offset="15692570">Assuming however arguendo that we were dealing with the inherent rights of natural persons, we must assume that since the petitioners have distinguished such rights from rights which are granted by the State presumably by statute, that such rights refer to those which are in inexistence under the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.837" offset="15778670">There is, of course, no national common law operative as such throughout the States of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.933" offset="15799150">The adoption and application of the common law was a matter left to the several States for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.396" offset="15824959">In New York, the common law of England remains enforced except as modified by statute by force of a constitutional provision to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.022" offset="15863411">In other words, by virtue of the constitutional provision, the common law is included in that which is granted by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.644" offset="15901968">Literally, therefore, the provision of Section 3, which is quoted by the petitioner, applies to all rights, privileges and immunities because the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof include the common law as well as the statute law of the States and all rights, privileges and immunities are granted by such laws since those terms describe the extent to which particular individual group claims or interest are secured by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.675" offset="16034043">In any event, the use of the word "granted" in the clause which terminated the petitioners' rights, privileges and immunity, is of no particular significance and may properly be equated with the clearly broader term "attendant" which appears in the prior clause in the same section, "The Communist Party of the United States or any successors of such party are not entitled to any of the rights, privileges and immunities attended upon legal bodies created under the jurisdiction of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof."</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.524" offset="16177507">Clearly, it must have been the intention of Congress to terminate those rights, privileges and immunities to which it felt that the petitioners were not entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.339" offset="16216691">And lastly, on this particular aspect of the case, I must observe that the petitioners have urged that the right to employ others is a natural or inherent right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.512" offset="16257442">But we are not here concerned with the right to employ others or with the general right over the right to enter to any contract as in general proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.498" offset="16297357">We are concerned with the right to be an employer within the meaning of New York's Unemployment Insurance Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.529" offset="16329540">And that light unquestionably is the subject of a statutory grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.577" offset="16357648">Now, the petitioners have also argued that the provisions of the Internal Security Act as Section 5 of the Communist Control Act evinced a legislative intent not to terminate the right of the petitioners to have and to function through employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.358" offset="16424835">And in support, thereof, they quote the Department of Justice in the briefs submitted to this Court in Communist Party against the Subversive Activities Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.014" offset="16463391">The reference is, of course, to the registration provisions of the Internal Security Act and to the provisions of Section 5 of the Communist Control Act which deal with the determination by a jury of membership participation or knowledge of purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.595" offset="16525772">The argument is predicated on the obvious -- obviously meaningless assumption that Congress would destroy the petitioners in one section and recognize their continued viability in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.078" offset="16583659">However, analysis of the statute exposes the fallacy of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.100" offset="16603721">Congress has effectively destroyed the Communist Party as a legal entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.035" offset="16627545">Nevertheless, Congress was aware of the fact that this might drive the movement underground and that it might continue thereafter on an illegal basis.</text>
