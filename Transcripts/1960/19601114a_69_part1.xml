            <text syncTime="4.132" offset="119933">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.656" offset="129964">When the Court arose for the lunch and recess, I was attempting to set forth some of the incongruities which we think that the decision below gives rise to -- particularly in connection with Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.744" offset="190360">That Section as I explained gives a right to anyone who has been injured in his business by one of these jurisdictional dispute strikes, the right to bring a suit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.299" offset="232573">That Section does not create a different right than is created in Section 8 (b) 4 (D) or a different offense and is created in Section 8 (b) (4) (D) but adds the sanctions of a cease and desist order, the sanctions of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.238" offset="284296">And as this Court made clear in the Juneau Spruce case decided some six or seven years ago, this Court made clear in that case, the elements of the offence under 8 (b) (4) (D) and 303 are the same and that prosecution for damages under 303 is in no way dependent upon an antecedent for determination under Section 10 (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="72.153" offset="392025">Under Section 303, as under Section 8 (b) 4 (D), a claim to a disputed work based upon tradition, custom or what have you is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.515" offset="441448">Now, we believe that if the -- that if the offense in -- under Section 303 is established as the statute says is established by showing that the employer's -- by showing that the employer's assignment is not in derogation of a Board certificate or order within the meaning of 8 (b) 4 (D), then tradition and practice are irrelevant to a Section 303 action and if they are irrelevant to a Section 303 action, we believe that they are also irrelevant under 8 (b) 4 (D) as well as Section 10 (k) because --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="118.492" offset="577390">Section 303 action is what -- even if 8 (b) (4) (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="126.690" offset="610095">That's right, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.179" offset="616051">Due -- there had been a situation where the Board has found an 8 (b) 4 (D) violation or rather no violation of 8 (b) 4 (D) but a District Court has.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.158" offset="651995">But the Court of -- the -- this Court made clear in the Juneau Spruce case however, that a Section 303 action is not dependent upon a prior board determination in a Section 10 (k) hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.989" offset="703300">Now, if tradition and custom are irrelevant to a 303 action, as I say, we think they are also irrelevant under the provisions of the statute that the Board administers because if it were not so -- if it were not so, you would have the rather startling result that a strike could be illegal under 303 for purposes of awarding damages and yet lawful under the unfair labor practice provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.228" offset="808312">Decisions below leads not only to this incongruity but it also cuts across, we think -- it also cuts across of what -- one of the most basic policies of the statute, namely the policy against discrimination in employment which encourages or discourages union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.759" offset="882395">Under the statute, an employer has the inherent right to select his employees and make his work assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.476" offset="909249">The principle restriction which a statue imposes upon the exercise of that right is that it shall not be exercised in a discriminatory fashion so as to encourage or discourage union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.644" offset="950000">But the ruling below which would require the Board to award -- award work affirmatively to the members of one union or another under the basis of tradition, custom and the like, would foster through the Section 10 (k) proceedings a circumvention of this policy against discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.867" offset="1022830">Now, let me illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.160" offset="1032025">Suppose that you had an employer whose employees are presently members of or represented by union A and that that employer has obtained a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.974" offset="1071313">Union B claiming that its members are entitled to this kind of work puts pressure upon him to give its members to -- or puts pressure upon the employer to give the work to his members.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.240" offset="1116348">Now, the employer can either discharge his employees and -- and replace them with members of union B or it can give up the job altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.241" offset="1152293">In either case, there is discrimination against his employers by reason of their non-membership in union B.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.597" offset="1177788">Let me cite one more example.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.721" offset="1186252">Often, the jurisdictional disputes pit a union against an -- an unorganized group of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.595" offset="1221778">If tradition or custom were to be controlling in a situation like that, the chances are that in -- in most cases, the union would probably prevail as against the unorganized group because the union undoubtedly couldn't make a better showing of tradition or custom or practice in support of its claim than could the unorganized group.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.995" offset="1299310">Again, you would have encouragement of the unorganized group to join the union which obtained the -- the work by virtue of its claims based upon tradition or custom or practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.393" offset="2628942">The 1947 House Bill contained a provision which prohibited jurisdictional disputes -- jurisdictional strikes over assignment of works -- of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.430" offset="2677112">It did not contain any provision comparable to the Section 10 (k) provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.551" offset="2697592">The Senate Bill -- the Senate Bill did contain a Section 10 (k) provision which had been proposed by Senator Morse but that differs however from the present provision of the Bill in that -- in that Section 10 (k) as passed by the Senate, required the Board or an arbitrator appointed by the Board to hear and determine the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.095" offset="2783796">And Senator Morse said that this made for compulsory arbitration of these jurisdictional disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.989" offset="2815352">Now, when the thing went to conference -- when the -- when this Bill went to conference, the conference deleted -- deleted from the Senate Bill, the provision empowering the Board to appoint an arbitrator to determine these disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.631" offset="2869896">The conference bill came back to the Senate and Senator Morse complained of the deletion saying that the -- the result of the deletion would be to put the Board into the arbitration business, a kind of business for -- to which the Board had no special competence and for which these procedures were ill-suited.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.464" offset="2937187">Now, it is significant to know that after the conference bill was reported out and after Senator Morse had made these objections, the amendment of -- to carving out his -- his suggestions that none of the proponents of the conference bill shared the view of Senator Mores that this would put the Board into the arbitration business.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.806" offset="3038647">Now, I think from this legislative history, you can draw two inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.405" offset="3052962">The Court undoubtedly will make its own appraisal of the -- of the legislative history but as we see it, the legislative history either means that the Board was put into the arbitration business or -- or that Congress, realizing the impact of putting the Board into this form of compulsory arbitration, realizing the impact of that sort of thing upon Section 303, upon the provisions prohibiting discriminations by reason of union membership, realizing those things shied away, shied away from this compulsory arbitration and left the Board to move in an area in which it had some familiarity in which it had some competence, namely whether the assignment was in derogation of a bargaining cert -- of a certificate or order within the meeting of the Section 8 (b) (4) (D).</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.942" offset="9991189">Now, in order to come out with the right result, the Board has adopted incorrect reasoning we believe and it says that in a situation such as arises in the Winslow Bros. and Smith Company case where there are two unions involved, each having contracts then in that kind of a situation, if the strike occurs and there's a contract to support it then it too becomes a part of the unless clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.767" offset="10294418">The Board's brief recites the fact that its contemporaneous construction and consistent construction has been in a manner which is now says is the correct implication.</text>

            <text syncTime="3637.277" offset="14652479">One was the language of the Act and the other was this very thing that's been mentioned which is a desire of the parties, particularly in the building trades not to have their disputes settled by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.841" offset="14722696">But that does mean that because they desire it both management and the labor, let us say, that that changes the statutory provisions of the Act or the legislative history thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="3688.697" offset="14858115">Board rule is that if the employer assigns the work then we'll have an inquiry as to whether there is an order of certification which let's say in this industry there is none, but they don't have certifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.569" offset="14925615">Now, under those circumstances, an employer does not have the incentive to become a part of this voluntary arrangement because he can by assigning, get the full support of the federal government to restrain any conduct in violation of that assignment.</text>
