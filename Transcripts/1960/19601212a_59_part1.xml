            <text syncTime="14.529" offset="161520">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.311" offset="188583">The petitioner in this case was born in 1891 in Cosenza, Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.335" offset="236753">He came to the United States at the age of four in 1895.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.294" offset="276564">He filed a declaration of the intention to apply for citizenship in March of 1923 and filed a preliminary form of application in May of 1925, an application for citizenship in September of 1925 and was granted citizenship at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.195" offset="400175">Suit was instituted under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in May of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.300" offset="452524">There were a number of grounds alleged for the revocation, cancellation of citizenship but the one that is germane on this petition is that the petitioner is alleged to have willfully misrepresented his occupation in his preliminary form of application and in his application for citizenship in that he stated that his occupation was real estate when in fact the Government contends he was a bootlegger.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.336" offset="624724">Now, the trial judge entered an order revoking citizenship on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.233" offset="660355">He rejected all of the other grounds averred by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.765" offset="686477">The two grounds were that there was a willful misrepresentation of occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.351" offset="716779">And secondly, a willful misrepresentation when petitioner swore that he would support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="166.254" offset="768397">On the theory that he was down there violating the Eighteenth Amendment of the (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="170.516" offset="785429">On the theory that he didn't love the Constitution that he didn't love all of it and the Eighteenth Amendment was a part of it and that there was certainly a mental reservation with respect to that part of it when he swore allegiance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.594" offset="845720">That contention, Mr. Justice Stewart, was rejected by the Circuit Court on the ground that the swearing to support the Constitution of the United States really is a foreswearing of allegiance to the fatherland and a swearing of allegiance to the ideological concept of the democratic system and that it does not require embracing all the individual parts of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.141" offset="967973">There was no allegation that he misrepresented the fact when he said he was attached to the principles of the Constitution and so that second ground was rejected by the Court of Appeals leaving only one ground as the predicate for denaturalization as the case comes to this Court in its present posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.094" offset="1055744">Now, it's our contention, if the Court please, that there is not evidence to support the finding that there was a willful misrepresentation of the fact with respect to this petitioner's occupation at the time the representation was made in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.884" offset="1158875">The evidence in the trial court shows through an immigration and naturalization inspector who was offered by the Government as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.263" offset="1208404">That on October 31, 1924, a corporation was formed called the Koslo Realty Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.466" offset="1257200">The petitioner was the president of this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.855" offset="1274755">A charter was issued by the State of New York authorizing this company to buy, sell, manage and lease real estate in New York and all of the United States and abroad and to build (Inaudible) houses and other buildings in the same territorial area.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.012" offset="1363466">The record shows that the president -- the president of this corporation was the petitioner and that his associate who was the secretary of the corporation was one (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="328.779" offset="1418533">The record further shows that prior to his preliminary application for naturalization, this company purchased two apartment buildings at West End Avenue and 92nd Street in New Year.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.791" offset="1478510">The record shows that these were substantial purchases because there was a purchase-money mortgage issued on the transaction which was of record and brought to court by the witness for the Government in the amount of $76,800.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.182" offset="1548100">And on June 22, 1925, prior to the petitioner's naturalization, these apartments were in fact sold bearing mortgages of $116,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.425" offset="1613093">The record further shows that the petitioner on this individual transaction made a profit for himself of $25,000 in the year 1925 which is the crucial year in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.035" offset="2103463">Now, the Immigration and Naturalization Examiner said that these records were unearthed by examining the real estate records for four boroughs of New York, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx and Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.169" offset="2200012">Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.878" offset="2202833">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.240" offset="2208371">There were only four boroughs wherein an investigation was made, although the corporation charter specifically gave authorization to do business throughout New York State and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.221" offset="2268244">Over and above this, the record shows that lots were purchased by this corporation in August of 1925 -- on August 12, 1925 in the Bronx.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.011" offset="2323414">They were sold the next year to the Rosenblum Realty Corporation on June 22 of 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.695" offset="2358105">The record also shows a very substantial real estate transaction entered into by this corporation of which the petitioner was president.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.082" offset="2403662">In October of 1925, when several pieces of ground at Nelson Avenue in the Bronx were acquired, there was a purchase-money mortgage of $70,000 on this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.059" offset="2459564">And within six months, this property was sold with a purchase-money mortgage of $310,000 on it with buildings having been erected on it and the sale was consummated subject to leasings and tenancies then in existence demonstrating that substantial buildings had been put up in 1925, sold in 1926 with leasings and tenancies, carrying a mortgage money of $300,000 by the corporation of which this man was the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.240" offset="2612328">The record further shows that there were two other corporations, the Babylon Waterfront Company and White Homes Incorporated both of which charters were issued for real estate operations, one in January 26, and the other in July of 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.350" offset="2680769">I think it's one of the verities of life that one does not become active of record in the real estate business until a certain passage of time takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.552" offset="2729566">There is a record here that that from the four boroughs which were examined for the years in question, these transactions took place at this time and that there was a profit made by the petitioner of $25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.532" offset="2785468">Now, the record also shows that during the 13 years between 1919 and 1932, the petitioner had income of $305,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.225" offset="2860283">That's significant for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.931" offset="2875120">The income is specifically delineated in the record for the years 1927, 1929 and 1930, namely that he had income in those three years of $134,000 leaving $171,000 of income to be distributed over the remaining 10 years, which would give a mean average of about $17,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.878" offset="2974908">Now, I say vis-à-vis the profit that was made in the real estate transaction of 1925 on the sale of the apartments at West End Avenue and 92nd Street, it can be seen that the $25,000 income constituted not merely a substantial part of the income for that year derived at from a mean average but the major part of petitioner's income for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.822" offset="3086712">Now, this $305,000 figure was a figure arrived at with the Bureau of Internal Revenue in a settlement of tax liability for the 13 years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.139" offset="3135927">Now, if the Court please, if this case were here, not as a denaturalization case but as a perjury case, I think that it's fair to say that qualitatively, the evidence here would not support a perjury conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.665" offset="3246059">And I think the only difference between a perjury case on this answer and a denaturalization case is in the quantum of proof and the procedural requisites of proving perjury under the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.557" offset="3301648">But qualitatively, I don't think that the evidence supports the fact that this was a perjurious answer or a willfully false answer because in fact at the time that the representation was made by the petitioner, that he was in the real estate business, the record shows as adduced by the Government itself in this case in truth, in fact he was in the real estate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.354" offset="3420766">Now, of course, the quantum of proof, as this Court has said on many occasions, is that evidence must be clear and convincing and unequivocal as stated in the Baumgartner and the Schneiderman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.942" offset="3479176">Now, the Court has said in the Nowak and Maisenberg cases in 1958, that where the question is subject to an inference by the person interrogated and that the inference is reasonable and that he answers it truthfully on the inferential predicate that a denaturalization decree will not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.006" offset="3615431">In that case, there was a two-pronged question, "Do you believe in anarchy?</text>
            <text syncTime="884.544" offset="3641553">Do you belong to any organization or association which advocates anarchy or the overthrow of the United States Government?"</text>
            <text syncTime="895.078" offset="3683662">In those cases, the petitioner has answered in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.955" offset="3699231">In each instance, they were members of the Communist Party at the time that they made these answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.424" offset="3725040">And this Court said that those questions under the doctrine of the Houston (Inaudible) might conceivably have been interpreted by the person answering as calling for an answer dealing with belief in anarchy or the belonging to an organization advocating anarchy and that alone and therefore, in that frame, his answers could not be said to constitute a willful misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.639" offset="3861922">Now, in this case, if the Court please, the Government conceded below and the Court of Appeals found that the question propounded was subject to the inference that it was calling for the petitioner's legitimate occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.444" offset="3957112">In the Government's position as enunciated in its printed brief below, it said, "Surely, this question could have been construed as calling for the petitioner's legitimate occupation."</text>
            <text syncTime="989.105" offset="4059826">He could have interpreted the question as calling for only legitimate occupations.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.636" offset="4081873">And in the opinion of the Court of Appeals below, the Court said the very same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.946" offset="4139133">At page 250 of the record where the opinion appeal -- appears, "Surely, it's conceivable that an applicant might believe that the answer call for no more than a disclosure of some legal occupation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.594" offset="4217710">And if that concession is made and if that concession is found to be the fact by the lower court and if the record clearly shows that the petitioner was engaged in an occupation as a real estate operator, then I say, that it must follow inevitably that the decree of the lower court must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.092" offset="4339754">Now, how could this information concerning alleged criminal activity have been elicited from the petitioner?</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.109" offset="4375803">I say it could have been elicited in exactly the way that it's now elicited by the Immigration and Naturalization authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.213" offset="4488234">There is spelled out an exact quote from the application for naturalization as it exist today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.596" offset="4533791">And this is the way the information is elicited today which the Government says should have been elicited by virtue of the simple question, occupation, my present occupation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.874" offset="4590843">It says, "The law provides that no person shall be regarded as a person of good moral character who, during the period of residence required for naturalization is or was a habitual drunkard, has committed adultery, derived income principally from illegal gambling activities, has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining any benefits under the immigration and naturalization laws, is or was a polygamist who practiced or advocated polygamy, is or was a prostitute or engaged in or received support of the proceeds from prostitution or procured, imported, or attempted to procure or import persons for prostitution or any other immoral purposes, or who came to the United States to engage in any other unlawful commercialized vice, who has committed a crime involving moral turpitude or is or has been an illicit trafficker in narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.717" offset="4814242">Have you, at any time, either within or outside the United States ever been or ever committed any of these things or acts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.002" offset="4867427">Now, if that question had been asked to the petitioner and if the evidence had showed that he was in fact, in 1925 or at any time theretofore, engaged in bootlegging and he'd answer to the negative, there would have been no question that this would have been a willfully false, materially false representation on which a denaturalization decree certainly might well have been predicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1270.030" offset="5183509">Generally, in admitted slips of those days, there would appear on the back of the slip, the words NCR which would stand for no criminal record or if a criminal record were divulged, the record would be delineated on the back of the admitted card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.466" offset="5273266">But here, there was no showing that such question was ever asked of the petitioner and the trial court found that the Government's proof did not measure up on this score.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.181" offset="5336064">So that -- or the -- the questions that were put can be found in the record, first of all, at page 200, question two, "My present occupation is real estate."</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.226" offset="5416312">And then, the Government contends that at page 202, the typed in words "Real Estate" were an oral answer given by petitioner to an Immigration and Naturalization Examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.336" offset="5480678">And then in the actual petition for naturalization which appears at page 204, Government's Exhibit 9, which was executed on September 10, 1925, the second answer, "My occupation is Real Estate."</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.979" offset="5559254">So for these reasons, it is petitioner's contention that the Government's case did not establish that there had been a willful misrepresentation of fact by petitioner in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.255" offset="5628426">Now, secondly, the trial judge specifically refused to draw an inference from the fact that petitioner did not testify in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.898" offset="5707003">And the petitioner did not testify in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.376" offset="5724871">The Court of Appeals, in its opinion, at page 208 of the record, has this to say, "We think the District Court, though it did not do so, might properly have buttressed its findings by the unfavorable inferences to be drawn from the fact that Costello chose to remain off this witness stand and to introduce no evidence in answers -- in answer to the Government on this case indicating fraud."</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.663" offset="5857991">The matters inquired into were within Costello's peculiar knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.040" offset="5875545">Since Costello was not a criminal defendant in the present proceedings, he had no privilege to remain silent, citing the Matles case in the Second Circuit and the (Inaudible) case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.599" offset="5925804">Then, if the Court please, the Circuit Court went on to do precisely what the trial court had not done because in the record, at page 250, at the bottom of the third paragraph on that page, the Court says, "If there was any further evidence along this line," meaning evidence of real estate operations, "it would be peculiarly within the knowledge of Costello and his failure to produce evidence of such activity warrants the inference that there was none such."</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.425" offset="6073031">Now, that alone, I would not contend, was sufficient to say that the appellate court drew an inference against him from his failure to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.475" offset="6113259">But that in context with the final sentence on this page, "Surely," said the Circuit Court, "it is conceivable that an applicant might believe that the answer called for no more than a disclosure of some legal occupation."</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.197" offset="6188178">There is no evidence in the record that Costello so believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.719" offset="6202284">In other words, a hiatus in the proof is supplied by silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.652" offset="6238020">And I say that the Government is spiked on the horns of a dilemma with respect to this proposition of law because either the law is that a defendant maybe called in a denaturalization proceeding to give evidence against himself or he may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.679" offset="6326105">Either citizenship is one of those things protected within the purview of the Fifth Amendment or it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.167" offset="6360064">If it is, then he could not have been called and it likewise follows that no inference could have been drawn against him from his failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.485" offset="6405308">If it is not, then he was equally available to the Government and they could have called him and asked him the specific question as to what he believed the question meant when it was propounded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.050" offset="6463613">So that they are seeking to draw an inference from the failure to produce evidence which was equally available to the Government as it was to the defendant if a defendant is properly callable and if he is not properly callable, then they are taking his privilege within the Fifth Amendment and turning it back inferentially against him to avoid the true purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.996" offset="6559326">Now, this Court has never passed on the question, the specific question as to whether a defendant may be called by the Government in an effort to denaturalize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.390" offset="6612929">That wasn't reached in the Minker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.217" offset="6632260">The Matles case in the Second Circuit ruled that he could be called but it was with some misgivings that Judge Clark penned those words and so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.367" offset="6680848">And in this case, in the first instance, the trial judge, Judge Palmieri wrote a long and learned decision on this and concluded by saying that all of his instincts and all of his thoughts in the matter led him to believe that a defendant should not be called in this kind of proceeding but that he was fearful that it would abort the Government's case if he denied them the right to call petitioner and so, he allowed them to call him and -- so that the matter could be passed upon by an appellate court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.023" offset="10491486">He was tried in 1927 and the jury disagreed that no retrial was ever held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.922" offset="10523042">In the Court of Appeals' opinion, the Court points out so far as the early wiretapping is concerned, the testimony shows that in the period prior to 1925, the United States Attorney in New York was conducting an investigation of bootlegging activities of a number of persons including the petitioner in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.063" offset="10603604">And that in the course of this investigation, certain telephones were tapped and it goes on to list the assistants who were in charged of this investigation and subsequently list the indictment which was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.378" offset="10656893">In any event, in 1939, there was a federal grand jury proceeding in the Southern District of New York conducted by the then United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and this petitioner was called and he gave testimony to the fact that he had engaged in violation of the liquor laws of the United States during the period in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.911" offset="10758980">So that -- that there has been information within the Canada Government as I indicated since 1926, 1925, December, we can go back that far, to the effect that this petitioner at or about the time of naturalization, was engaged in the conduct which is now being used as the predicate prescripting him of his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.313" offset="10876635">In -- in the decision of the Circuit Court the first time, it's interesting to observe that in defense of the use of the wiretap evidence that was made in 1925, the Circuit Court observes while you can't complain about the use of this wiretap evidence because it was spread out on the public records of the courts of New York and therefore available to the immigration authorities and the republication of wiretap information certainly isn't an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.990" offset="11015293">In other words, they were justifying the fact that the immigration authorities used wiretap evidence spread on the records of New York, saying it was public information and they could have got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.205" offset="11060224">The same argument, of course, holds that the fact that the man was engaged in the activities which they contented he was engaged in 27 years later, was available to him because they said the fruit of such tapping was spread on the public record of the open trial for bootlegging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.335" offset="11124694">We do not construe 605 of the Communications Act to render it, a crime to republish information which was lawfully intercepted and divulge once before prior to the Act's passage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.121" offset="11639829">Now, the only justification for this doctrine is a public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.821" offset="11658637">Now, at the time that he enunciated this doctrine of public policy, it was the public policy of this nation as enunciated in his congressional statute that treason prosecution shouldn't be brought three years after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.745" offset="11710360">I say that the public policy with respect to citizenship ought to be the other way because otherwise, we are leading inevitably to a duality of classification for citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.338" offset="12020694">Now, again, whatever effect you will give to the decision of the court below in the first case when it entered its dismissal, I think this must follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.098" offset="12103764">Judge Palmieri in the lower court found that all the source material for the affidavit of good cause, all the source material that he had available to him indicates on their face that wiretaps were extensively used and that there were innumerable wiretaps and that these wiretaps clearly vitiated the alleged admissions in the aforementioned hearings by the defendant from the standpoint of their use as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.914" offset="12266977">This was what Judge Palmieri found that the evidence before the New York grand jury and before the referee assigned by the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court was evidence that was infected plainly with wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.945" offset="12327163">The Court of Appeals agreed with him and it said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.186" offset="12352136">It said, and this is the first time this case went to the Second Circuit, it said the moving papers included extracts from the defendant's testimony before a New York County grand jury in 1943 before a referee appointed by the New York State Appellate Division, First Department in 1943 in regard to disciplinarian proceedings against Thomas Aurelio and before the Kefauver Committee in the United States Senate which held hearings in 1950 and 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.177" offset="12456103">These transcriptions suggested that state officers had indeed tapped the defendant's phone in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.708" offset="12490167">As a result of which, he testified before the three bodies to facts which he might not otherwise have revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.161" offset="12524022">Now, after this finding by the trial judge and by the Circuit Court Judge, the trial judge in the second case admitted this evidence against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.170" offset="12568012">Not only that he admit the evidence against the petitioner but he made the very evidence which was infected with wiretapping, a major crutch in his findings of fact and he quotes extensively in his opinion at pages 24 and 25 from this very evidence to show admissions made by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.692" offset="12662157">Now, the fact of the matter is, the record shows that in this interrogation, which was admitted into evidence against this petitioner, he was confronted with 48 wiretapped conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.483" offset="12713253">The -- the interrogator told him that he had dozens of others, to use his exact language, and that he had 130 conversations between petitioner and one other person, not relevant to this case, and to dozens of conversations between petitioner and one (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.188" offset="12800084">And it's interesting to note that the petitioner was confronted with a tapped telephone conversation during this interrogation between him and one O'Connell who happened to be one of his co-indictees in the 1925 bootlegging case and on the same page, he's asked about whether he ever engaged in the liquor business and makes an admission that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.469" offset="12901230">Now, these things were offered against him in the trial court over vigorous objection after they had been found to have been -- admissions which were induced by wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.269" offset="12964446">And that finding had been confirmed by an appellate court which said that since they were state taps that it was not improper for the State District Attorney to use them in that proceeding or for them to be received in the federal court before (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.085" offset="13035708">When this matter came before the Circuit Court below, it did not elude in its opinion to the admission of this evidence but it is here, it is referred to in the Circuit Court as a basis for the finding that petitioner was a bootlegger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.951" offset="13115225">It's -- it's referred to, if the Court please, as one of the basis upon which the conclusion was drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.227" offset="13164231">At page 249 of the record, reference is made to this testimony which he was given when he -- which he had given when he was confronted with some 48 wiretaps and when he was told that there were dozens of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.679" offset="13226088">Of course, it's urged by the Government in its brief that at no time was he confronted with a wiretap that antedated 1930 but at no time was he told by his interrogator that the interrogator did not have in his possession, wiretaps that antedated 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.289" offset="13312502">And the fact is the record shows that there were wiretaps on his premises as early as 1925 and 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.265" offset="13356387">So for these reasons, if the Court please, because number one, there is not evidence here to support a finding of willful misrepresentation with respect to occupation because an inference was engaged in by the appellate court contrary either to the rights of the petitioner under the Fifth Amendment or contrary to the basic evidentially rule that evidence -- evidential inferences may not be drawn from the failure to produce evidence equally available to the other side and because the Government has waited 33 years in this instance to bring this action on information which it had in the first instance and because I believe that it will lead to a duality of classification of citizenship, if this rule is not enforced, the application of laches to this case and because the trial court received wiretapped evidence which had been excluded before and which had been found before to have induced the admissions of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.255" offset="13640391">For these reasons, I respectfully urge that this Court reverse the court below and send the case with orders for dismissal with finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.918" offset="13691068">Thank you, sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.749" offset="13734327">I should like to address myself in order to the contention relating to the adequacy of the Government's proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.178" offset="13780093">Secondly, I should like to go on to the contention that a portion of that proof was tainted because of wiretapping which had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.941" offset="13827114">And I should like to reserve for final consideration, the contentions which are based on the lapse of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.004" offset="13863372">Now, certainly, we agree with petitioner that the Government has a burden, a heavy burden of showing by convincing evidence that the misrepresentation was a misinterpretation to begin with and that it was willfully made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.684" offset="13942157">And I think that burden is certainly, particularly heavy when the facts go back a good many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.667" offset="13982072">Now, in dealing with the question of proof, Mr. Williams has challenged the adequacy of the Government's evidence but perhaps understandably has not summarized that evidence or any of its particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.024" offset="14051453">Now, before going on to those particulars, I would like to make brief reference to what the courts below found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.671" offset="14082069">At pages 27 and 28, Your Honors will find the findings of the District Court and you will note that in the first finding, Judge Dawson found that prior to May 1, 1925, several years prior and several years thereafter, "Costello was" and I quote the Court, "actively and extensively engaged in the occupation of smuggling, trucking, storing, purchasing and dealing in alcoholic beverages in violation of law."</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.117" offset="14239848">And he finds secondly that the real occupation of Costello at the time was not real estate but was bootlegging.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.457" offset="14313200">Well, I would argue, Your Honor, that at least a person is under an obligation when he is called upon to state his occupation, to state that which is his predominant occupation, the occupation in which he is engaged everyday, the occupation which provides in his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.583" offset="14409749">And I will seek -- show that the Government's proof here established that as of the time when Costello petitioned for naturalization, his daily activity was bootlegging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.330" offset="14464711">That produced all of his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.650" offset="14477981">In the year 1925, this realty company purchased one piece of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3606.923" offset="14531062">So as of the time, that all three of his statements were made, that petitioner was engaged in real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.104" offset="14567737">The fact was that petitioner had not derived one penny from the occupation which he gave on his form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.109" offset="14595845">Now, I -- I do intend to show in contrast to that the nature and the extent of the bootlegging activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.541" offset="14633566">And the conclusion which I would reach by this recital is that on the fact shown, there could've been no misunderstanding as to what was called for by the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.960" offset="14687169">And on the fact shown, the representation made can only be viewed as false.</text>
