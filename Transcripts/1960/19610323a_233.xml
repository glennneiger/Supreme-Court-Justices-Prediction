            <text syncTime="408.115" offset="1735868">And in -- about the middle of that page where the Chairman is continuing, he states that, “This Committee is not investigating labor unions, but is investigating Communism within the field of labor where it has substantial evidence that it exists.”</text>
            <text syncTime="421.817" offset="1790621">And then he makes reference to the Committee's interest in view of H.R. 7487, which was a bill which would have dealt with the subject of Communist-dominated labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.373" offset="1832835">Now, another reference which shows committee's interest in these Albany hearings can be seen in the Committee's annual report for 1954, which is also part of the record and which appears beginning at page 320, where on page 325, where the Committee is summarizing the hearings it -- it did hold in April, 1954 at Albany.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.213" offset="2036276">So that the evidence here in the -- in the Committee hearings and in the report of the Committee on those hearings, clearly shows that the Committee was interested in Communist infiltration into labor and Communist infiltration into education.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.915" offset="2107016">Now in addition, during the Albany hearings that began on April 7, two witnesses testified concerning they're having attended Cornell University and concerning they're having taking summer jobs in Communist-dominated labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.228" offset="2228328">Now, in that connection it was explained that one of these witnesses were the school of the Industrial Labor and Relations at Cornell and that school had a policy of requiring each student.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.184" offset="2288097">During the summers, he was in attendance at the school to at least make an effort to spend one -- one summer working with -- with a management group, one summer with a union group and one summer with a mediation board.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.974" offset="2343267">Now, these witnesses testified as to they're having attended or having taking summer jobs and in connection with those jobs in -- which were connected with unions having been engaged in Communist Party activities and then continuing to engage in Communist Party activities upon there return to the Cornell campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.308" offset="2432606">One of the witnesses, Emmanuel Ross Richardson testified before the Committee, I think on April the 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.502" offset="2489344">And he stated that he had gone into the UE -- had going to work with UE union, the United Electrical workers at the General Electric plant in 1948 and was there recruited into the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.726" offset="2550262">He returned to the Cornell in the fall and continued in the Communist Party on the campus.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.479" offset="2605328">That after he was recruited into the Party, he was assigned to the labor youth leg.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.569" offset="2661648">He identified the membership of this group as being the petitioner and petitioner's wife, one Homer Owen and Owen's wife and a Mr. Marzac and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.172" offset="2712012">He also testified that he was aware of only one member of the faculty at Cornell who was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.406" offset="2745031">And then he didn't know the identity of that person, that the petitioner here was the only -- was the contact man for the Communist Party with this member of the faculty at Cornell.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.847" offset="2802709">Richardson also testified that during this period of time, 1950 to 1953, he had received from the petitioner a $100 contribution to the Communist Party, which the petitioner had received from a source which was unknown to Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.103" offset="2891734">Now, because of this information furnished by Richardson and by the other witness that I referred to Marqusee and also -- who also testified before the Committee and their testimony is in the record, and also because of information furnished to the Committee by Homer Owen, in conference with the members of the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.637" offset="3009912">Mr. Tavenner, the committee counsel, testified at the trial that as a result of this information, the Committee was interested in determining the extent of the -- of the possible inter -- interplay between Communist infiltration into education and Communism in the field of labor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.866" offset="5338885">Now, then the Chairman explained to him that moral scruples was not a legal objection, that his declination must consist of something more than his moral scruples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.011" offset="5383398">And Mr. Deutch then said, “As to details that, I think the whole question has been magnified more than it should have.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.463" offset="9749191">Well, Your Honor, the -- the sentence here is the same type sentence as was imposed in Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.645" offset="9777925">It -- it is a general sentence upon the conviction on all -- on each of the counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.141" offset="9799973">In the -- in the slip opinion of the Court's decision in Barenblatt, the Court states that upon conviction under all counts, a general sentence of six months imprisonment and a fine of $250 was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.181" offset="9864129">Since this sentence was less than the maximum punishment authorized by the statute for conviction under any one count, the judgment below must be upheld, if the conviction upon any of the counts is sustainable, citing the Claassen, Roviaro, Whitfield case to which we would add the -- the case of Pinkerton v. U.S., 328 U.S. 640, which I think you'll support for the type of sentence that was given here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.148" offset="9980008">In other words, the -- the Court sentenced him to a general sentence which I think has the same effect and the Court has so held as if he had sentenced him to 90 days on each count to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.964" offset="10039254">And -- and then if anyone of those counts supports the general sentence, then the -- the verdict below must be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.456" offset="10089200">Now, to just spend a -- a minute or two on the -- on the question that be diverted from the beginning as to the -- the question here or the distinction that we make and we think the Court has made between actual pertinency or jurisdictional pertinency as the Court I think referred to it in the Watkins case and awareness of pertinency which is a completely different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.845" offset="10234755">As we see it, there's a two-fold obligation that is involved in one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.283" offset="10264534">One is that the statute requires that there be proof of actual pertinency, pertinency as a matter of law to a subject under investigation by the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.799" offset="10310614">This is imposed by the statute, it's an element of -- of the offense, it's an element which the Government can prove or must prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.614" offset="10341857">And the failure of the Government to prove actual pertinency of course can be raised by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.347" offset="10376756">The second problem arises as a result of the requirement laid down by this Court in the Watkins case, which involves the question of the awareness of pertinency which was a rule evolved for the protection and out of fairness to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.501" offset="10465364">And the Court clearly stated in the Watkins case that if the witness objects on the grounds of pertinency, it is the duty of the tribunal then and I think it's clear only then, need it make an explanation of pertinency to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.854" offset="10574764">If it is already been made clear to him, it would not even have to make in the -- further explanation in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.162" offset="10616038">But a -- an obligation on the Committee upon the refusal to answer to explain the pertinency and the connective reasoning if necessary, only arises when there is an objection at the time the question is propounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.787" offset="10682493">In the absence of such an objection, what the Government must do at trial is to show that there was a legislative committee that it -- that it would performing a legislative function, that it did have a subject under inquiry, that it was authorized to make and that this question was as a matter of law, pertinent to such subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.216" offset="10772250">Now here, the District Judge found if upon this evidence that the Committee -- and cannot be the Albany hearings of which I think it's only fair to say that the -- the petitioner's testimony was a part even though it may've been held in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.123" offset="10843826">It was held here for his convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.906" offset="10858977">The only purpose of the hearing being held here was because he -- he begged-off going to Albany on April 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.020" offset="10895444">If the District Court found that the Committee in the conducting the Albany hearings wasn't interested in Communism in labor and Communism in the field of education and the possible interrelationship between Communism and labor and Communism in the -- in the educational field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.469" offset="10969213">The -- a petitioner's appearance before the Committee, he was told very clearly, the Committee wants to know about your activities at Cornell in the Communist Party your activities in Ithaca.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.278" offset="11900531">No time that he refused to answer on the basis of the First Amendment and that we think that under the -- the Court's -- this Court's decision in the Ullman case, which involved the immunity statute that the Court there indicated in that case that it would not consider a First Amendment objection because he had not raised it before the trial court at the time he refused to answer the questions of the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.838" offset="12418696">First of all, Mr. Justice Stewart asked the question to me at the outset of my argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.293" offset="12440534">I (Inaudible) to look in the library this morning and I regret to say that I come to the same conclusion as Mr. Maroney, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.953" offset="12475225">Mr. Maroney has said that this Committee basically and he read Mr. Tavenner's remarks, was interested in pursuing and how does it subject to the interrelationship between the labor union infiltration on the one hand and the Communist on the Cornell campus on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.922" offset="12571042">That having taken place by -- of this practice of summer -- taking of summer jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.932" offset="12603120">The man, Marqusee, did that if you may recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.128" offset="12615868">And it's curious to me that if that's the subject, then that's what the Committee was interested in that they never asked Mr. Deutch anything about that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.583" offset="12649723">Now, repeatedly it's this -- practice is used as a link to link together the subject matter of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.821" offset="12690683">And I'm assuming now arguendo that reading the question discloses that the Committee is asking a series of questions about Cornell and obviously, even in the grammatical sense, a question must have a subject matter, of course, he knows when they say to him, “What was the source of the $100 contribution that the committee member or the committee counsel is interested in and the subject to that is the $100 contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.378" offset="12784933">If that's what's subject matter means in the statute is or in this Court's decision, it means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.052" offset="12803532">It would only bar an inquiry which was conducted by in -- by madman who couldn't frame sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.090" offset="12827773">It must mean more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.198" offset="12836133">Now, the Government had not addressed itself to a much more basic problem in dichotomy in this case in the subject area, then whether or not, he made a pertinency objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.866" offset="12878869">And that is the striking contradiction between proof at trial and subject matter at looking at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.439" offset="12917112">Now they say, oh, there was a link between -- between the proofs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.670" offset="12930069">What was proof of trial -- proof of trial concerned all of these questions of the infiltration of labor in the Albany area and the labor youth league and all such matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.516" offset="12969462">And -- and the subject as it developed by questions of the hearing and I'm not speaking now whether witness was aware of the subject or not, let's assume he was totally aware of it, it was totally the graduate group of Cornell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.860" offset="13018781">And the link is this practice of taking summer jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.468" offset="13037275">The only connection is this one thing and this was never asked Mr. Deutch, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.929" offset="13059114">Now, if they had been interested in that -- that was their subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.076" offset="13071653">One will assume that they were back in (Inaudible) or asking if he knew Mr. Marqusee and did Mr. Marqusee takes such a job or were you ever connected with the labor youth league or some questions in that field, there's something about labor, but the record of Mr. Deutch's hearing before the Committee is totally devoid of any references to these matters which were later introduced at trial is being the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.884" offset="13162872">I'd submit that the Government in no way, even addressed itself a -- a point to so, I think is the dilemma in sustaining this conviction from the standpoint of ordinary due process and the right of the defendant to have proved at trial, the elements of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.251" offset="13256391">The Government proved to the hilt the subject of Cornell, I mean of Albany and labor and -- and not the subject that was actually the one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.628" offset="13297873">And as I say, there's no question in my mind that they did it because they were concerned with the First Amendment risks so to speak of settling right down in Cornell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.198" offset="13340191">And as soon as Mr. Barenblatt came along, they would -- had less concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.413" offset="13353044">And now they're -- they're were in Cornell or at least, the link between the two, but even if it's the link between the two, nobody asked him about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.260" offset="13388361">Didn't asked about the interplay and these are all questions that -- that they did not ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.099" offset="13411767">Now, I'd like to say, I just like to say parenthetically, what I said about this is just, so the Court won't misunderstand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.014" offset="13435382">What I said was that when he came into this hearing room in Washington, he walked in and I said he knew two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.684" offset="13458160">He had a subpoena on his hand and he read the paper that Richardson had named him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.574" offset="13473625">And that he came before an unidentified man and then he was sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.587" offset="13485746">I didn't say they were unidentified from then on, but if you'll look at the record, he -- he was sworn, just a small point, but I don't want the court to think that I misled them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.936" offset="13523153">They were totally unidentified until he was sworn and the question commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.662" offset="13537991">And they turned out to be the three congressmen that they were indentified in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.718" offset="13898271">It's just that they prove that you see a trial, I would be the first to agree with you that there's no magic in -- in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.641" offset="13917915">But I think there's some magic in it when they prove it as a subject that then becomes a discrete thing and that it contradicts what happened at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.160" offset="13948008">But I -- I didn't want to touch upon one further point which seemed to me, the Government again has not met in any sense and that is the dilemma that's created by reason of this witness' full discussion of force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.274" offset="14000462">That being the information that it is said the Committee's need in order to legislate and this being the distinguishing feature which permits committees to go into what would otherwise be clearly a First Amendment-protected political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.117" offset="14067858">And it's the -- it's the Government that suggested this to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.105" offset="14079770">In the Watkins case, this Court said I didn't get a chance to mention this yesterday, that in the Watkins case, in the Chief Justice's opinion, he says the Government contends that the public interest at the core of investigations of the House Un-American Activities Committee is need by the Congress to be informed of efforts to overthrow the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.267" offset="14160436">Now, I still say that -- that if that is the distinguishing peculiarity which distinguishes the Communist Party and its treatment before the law and it must be, Your Honors, because otherwise this Court won't have the -- the insulation between that and other political movements who merely may be unpopular.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.169" offset="14247999">If you cut yourselves a drift from this particular distinguishing feature, I submit that it'll be difficult if not impossible to limit these restraints and encroachments on the First Amendment in favor of the investigative power, because that distinguishing feature is the one that has kept it from lapping over into other fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.289" offset="14332531">Now, why is that a dilemma in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.502" offset="14341413">Because this witness took the Committee to this very core.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.121" offset="14359907">He took them where this Court has always said they were entitled to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.344" offset="14380701">Only because of that core has this Court permitted in its opinions in Barenblatt and Watkins, it said it, it said it in CIO against Douds in the sense of all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.007" offset="14419362">This -- they said -- you have said, "While this Court sits in CIO against Douds, we will not permit these encroachments which we here permit as to the loyalty oath in the Communist Party to be extended, it's only because we must know, we must be informed, we must protect ourselves about the problem of force and violence."</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.682" offset="14494072">Here, the witness throughout his hearing, he's crossed-examined on it, talks to the Committee and tells them freely about force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.641" offset="14525942">And if that's true, he is taking them where they have been allowed to go in balancing encroachment against the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.452" offset="14565230">And how can we then justify being -- requiring compulsory testimony which would infringe the First Amendment, when they are only preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.233" offset="14604309">Mr. Maroney himself said, “Oh well, this question is preliminary to the Committee gained to what interests them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.780" offset="14626461">Well, what interests them according to the Government, the Watkins case is force and violence and this witness talked again and again about force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.433" offset="14649135">He was crossed-examined about force and violence, exhausted his knowledge about force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.266" offset="14672436">The Committee was satisfied that he knew nothing about the upper (Inaudible) of the Party and what they thought about force and violence, he was talking about his group.</text>
