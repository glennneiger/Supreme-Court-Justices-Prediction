            <label>Mr. Everett I. Willis</label>
            <text syncTime="13.345" offset="156714">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.563" offset="173641">This appeal presents a clear cut question of constitutional law, whether a State may constitutionally require a foreign corporation engaged only in interstate commerce to comply with its qualification statute and obtain a certificate of authority from the State in order to transact its interstate business in the State and may bar the corporation from access to its courts if it does not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.293" offset="288580">Now, the case arose in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.156" offset="299969">The appellant, which is one of the country's largest manufacturers of ethical drugs, is an Indiana corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.155" offset="331943">It sued the appellee in a New Jersey court to enjoin it from selling the appellant's trademark products at prices less than the minimum prices established pursuant to the New Jersey Fair Trade Law and the Federal McGuire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.756" offset="402369">The trial court, which was affirmed by the New Jersey Supreme Court without opinion, granted summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the appellant was barred from the courts of New Jersey for not having obtained a certificate of authority to transact business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.246" offset="492335">Now, the business the appellant transacts in New Jersey is entirely an interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.469" offset="517204">And the proceedings below, nobody disputed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.782" offset="530474">The appellant's factories are in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.418" offset="541027">All its products are manufactured there.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.595" offset="553775">All its sales were made under contracts entered into outside New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.437" offset="577076">The appellant makes no sales to retailers, only to wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.423" offset="601109">The appellant owns no property, leases no property in New Jersey, has no warehouse, no stock of goods in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.522" offset="641442">Indeed, the only activities of any kind, in New Jersey consist of promotional and informational activities by employees who neither solicit nor accept any orders from anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.867" offset="694836">There's a district manager who leases an office for the expense of which he is reimbursed by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.603" offset="725765">He supervises 18 highly trained detailmen who call on physicians, hospitals and pharmacists to acquaint them with these drugs, their ingredients, their therapeutic properties and promote the Lilly name and the use of its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.232" offset="808312">They distribute some free advertising and promotional literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.433" offset="829106">Occasionally, as a service to a retailer, they may transmit an order for him to a wholesaler who may fill it or not, as he pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.948" offset="867140">Basically, these detailmen are missionaries whose function it is, to promote the Lilly name and products, try to increase the demand for them by physicians, hospitals and pharmacists so that more orders will flow from the wholesalers to the factories in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.386" offset="940910">Now, until this case, New Jersey recognized that it could not constitutionally apply its qualification statute to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.583" offset="981661">The right to do interstate commerce being a federal right, not one to be granted, denied or conditioned by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.401" offset="1008933">Every other State in the union, which has addressed itself to the problem, either through its legislature or its courts, and there are 47 of them, has recognized the constitutional limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.089" offset="1063685">The classic decision of this Court on the subject is, of course, International Textbook Company against Pigg, which has been followed again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.001" offset="1107362">Now, the court below did not seriously suggest that if the Pigg case and the other qualification statutes cases that have followed it are still law, New Jersey would be able to apply its qualification statute to this appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.737" offset="1174340">It didn't suggest that the Pigg line of cases has ever been overruled or assert that this Court has ever upheld a qualification statute as applied to interstate commerce for it never has in its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.223" offset="1228257">What the Court said was that it thought it saw in some recent decisions of this Court a new trend, a new philosophy about interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.022" offset="1271411">But the only case it cited as an illustration of a new philosophy was the recent tax decision in Northwest Portland Cement.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.653" offset="1313938">Now, Northwest Portland Cement recognized the continued vitality of the basic principle of the Pigg line of cases which is that a State cannot impose conditions upon the right to engage in interstate commerce because that is outside the constitutional fit stair of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.310" offset="1396590">Is it conceded here, as it was there, that there is no local commerce involved, that this is exclusively interstate commerce that's been done by Eli Lilly?</text>

            <text syncTime="334.009" offset="1439431">The appellees have raised on this appeal for the first time, a new argument that the -- that Eli Lilly is partly engaged in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.453" offset="1497213">Now, they based on the Cheney case that came to this Court many years ago from Massachusetts, which nobody even mentioned below because the whole argument below was on the assumption and the premise that it was entirely interstate commerce and the question was whether it was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.813" offset="1562624">Now, we -- we contend -- that that question comes too late, is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.578" offset="1589687">The appellees do not deny that it's a new argument on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.527" offset="1605465">They seek to excuse it by arguing that when seeking affirmance, rather than reversal, you may raise new arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.706" offset="1634200">But we've cited the cases that there is no such rule on appeals from state courts and -- but -- but furthermore, there is no support in -- in the record for their -- for their contention in any event, as we have shown in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.686" offset="2638137">Now, the -- the Cheney case of course, was a tax case, but its -- its facts also were vastly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.988" offset="2679306">Now, the state court in Massachusetts, this came from Massachusetts and that court found that the Company involved there happened to be the Northwestern Consolidated Milling Company, had actually qualified to do a local business in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.478" offset="2737298">It had an office where orders were received and accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.614" offset="2749837">It had a stock of goods from which some sales were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.153" offset="2763943">And then it was found that a major part of its business consisted of furnishing salesmen to actually and regularly act as agents for local wholesalers in the aggressive solicitation of business for the wholesalers who would then fill it and get it paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.494" offset="2837400">Now, the appellees cease on the circumstance here to try to assimilate that to the Cheney case, which was never mentioned below, namely, the occasional courtesy transmissions of an order for a retailer which is not part of the mainstream or their regular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.039" offset="2915558">Now, on Portland -- Northwest Portland Cement, it had been found and it's recited in this Court's opinion, that the company involved there furnished salesmen -- had salesmen in the State taking orders from retailers and turning them over to retailers, actually soliciting.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.057" offset="2995597">It's not like ours, it's not just the occasional transmission service to a retailer, but an act -- regular active solicitation and the Court found that was entirely interstate commerce and this Court so found and it had this so find because it held that that corporation was subject to a net income tax which by his terms, didn't apply unless the corporation was solely an interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.267" offset="3864430">But now, if I may say, he -- of course, there's been more bad analysis in the interstate commerce field in any place and I -- I think we had a contribution toward here, because the -- the Court confused two lines of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.555" offset="3925556">Now, these qualification statutes that never been one upheld going to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.325" offset="3944678">And they have been regarded as falling in an entirely different category from a statute which basically regulates a local matter even though it affects interstate commerce and of course nearly all state regulations have some effect on interstate commerce, but the first question is, what is it you're regulating?</text>
            <text syncTime="978.770" offset="4018448">And if you're regulating health or safety or highways or keeping out disease cattle or adulterated food or something like that, then it is a local matter and if the effect on interstate commerce isn't too burdensome or discriminatory, it's alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.987" offset="4067349">But where the State lays its heavy hand right on the -- right to do interstate commerce which is the -- which is the case here, there's simply a basic lack of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.347" offset="4104756">And in the Portland Cement case, which upheld in that income tax, they pointed out -- the Court -- this Court pointed out that the reason that tax was valid and the Connecticut tax involved in the earlier Spector case was invalid, was because the Spector case was on the right to do interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.206" offset="4172152">And that being the incidence of the tax, you reach no question of -- of burden or -- or balancing of interests, it's simply a departure from the State's constitutional sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.353" offset="4212799">Now, the appellees argued here that the test of constitutionality is a balancing of the interest, the need of the State for the statute against the burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.553" offset="4253550">Now, we meet that because we think the need does not exist and that there is a definite burden, but our primary point is that there's simply no power and you don't reach that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.789" offset="4310497">Now, taking it, however, because taking the appellees' approach to it, the State really has no need to apply this statute to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.926" offset="4351039">This is a statute which dates from 1894 and what was its purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.912" offset="4370996">We don't have to guess at it because the New Jersey courts have ruled on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.947" offset="4383117">The purpose of the statute was to obtain, require the agent for service in the State and obtain jurisdiction in suits against foreign corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.150" offset="4423973">Now, that wasn't as easy in those days as it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.733" offset="4434317">There were still vestiges of theories about a corporation not existing outside its home state and not being able to be sued without its consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.351" offset="4464828">But now, we live in the days of the International Shoe decision and the McGee decision and it's perfectly simple to get jurisdiction over foreign corporations without any such statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.472" offset="4505266">All it takes is minimum contacts within the bounds of fair play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.913" offset="4527000">Now, the appellees don't -- don't assert that this statute is needed to get jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.529" offset="4553540">They realized under New Jersey law, you can serve whoever you can find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.556" offset="4565556">If you can't find anybody, you send a registered letter to the home office and you're in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.975" offset="4583320">They've devised a new theory that this statute is nevertheless quite useful for the State in supplying information as to the company's charter powers and possible tax liability and -- and the lawfulness of its activities and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.931" offset="4643088">But now, there are basic difficulties of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.095" offset="4651760">In the first place, it's simply is not the purpose for which the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.893" offset="4666911">It's just a -- a usefulness that counsel have found in court and secondly, it is an argument that would've been just as applicable in the Pigg case and all the other cases that have stricken down these qualification statutes to supply the interstate commerce, because they all follow the same path.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.054" offset="4743607">And so, there -- there simply isn't any need for the statute for the sole purpose for which it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.682" offset="4774118">Burden?</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.067" offset="4775685">Yes, there is a -- a definite deterrent to interstate commerce in it, in several ways.</text>
