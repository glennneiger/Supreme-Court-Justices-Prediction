            <label>Mr. J. Hubbard Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="11.679" offset="150131">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.341" offset="176776">I am J. Hubbard Davis of Norfolk, Virginia representing the petitioner, Virginia Milanovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.984" offset="199346">Mike Milanovich is represented by Mr. Bergan.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.134" offset="215960">We are here today on a writ of certiorari to the United States District -- I mean, Court of the Appeals of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.241" offset="248351">We are appealing on the grounds that she was erroneously convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.971" offset="271235">Virginia Milanovich was erroneously convicted of both stealing and having possession of the stolen goods and also that the Court erred, in failing to instruct the witnesses not to discuss their testimony, both of which, for prejudicial and harmful error to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.175" offset="352110">Briefly, the facts are that in June 2nd, 1958, Mike and Virginia Milanovich, husband and wife, Mike being a chief in the Navy of some 18 years experience, had met the three accomplices who were called in the lower court, the three thieves.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.685" offset="430164">They had been -- met them sometime earlier in the spring, April or May and they had come to Norfolk with the -- Norfolk, Virginia, with the idea that they would go into business.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.804" offset="482617">Mike lent them their -- his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.326" offset="496724">It was licensed to travel in and out the military installations because of the proper sticker that was on the windshield.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.999" offset="527339">On June 2nd, 1958, the jury still believed from the evidence presented that Mike and Virginia Milanovich and the company of the three accomplices, entered the United States Naval Amphibious Base, Norfolk, Virginia and burglarized the commissary store.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.062" offset="611662">The jury so believed that Virginia Milanovich was a driver of the car and that Mike was present therein, neither of the two Milanovich has touched any of the stolen property, did not enter the building, did not enter the safes.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.412" offset="676968">The three thieves broke into the building, broke into the safes and some $14,000 in cash, currency and checks were removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.926" offset="731094">The burglary took such a lengthy time that according to the evidence that the jury believed, the Milanovichs did not wait in their automobile at the appropriate rendezvous, but returned to their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.357" offset="780831">The three thieves, finding their transportation gone, buried their loot in the nearby woods and found a way by devious means to the Milanovich's home, subsequently left for their respective homes in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.222" offset="840286">Some two weeks later, on June 18th, Mr. Grammer, one of the three thieves, returned to Norfolk and visited with the Milanovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.976" offset="875290">And the jury so believed that at that time, he and the company of Virginia Milanovich went to the Amphibious Base and recovered some of the stolen loot.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.763" offset="922415">On the morning of the 19th, the FBI, on information, raided the home of the Milanovichs and there found Mike and Virginia Milanovich, a female friend by the name of (Inaudible) and one of the thieves, Mr. Grammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.217" offset="992214">At that time, with permission of the Milanovichs, their home was searched and approximately $1000 wrapped in bank wrappers of coins, were found in two containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.331" offset="1044668">One of which was a cosmetic bag of Virginia Milanovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.683" offset="1062118">She denied knowledge of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.717" offset="1070268">She said it was the property of the other woman in her house.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.921" offset="1087091">Be that as it may, the jury so believed that this was stolen property of the June 2nd break-in that it was in the possession of Virginia Milanovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.635" offset="1125961">And under the instruction given to the jury, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as a principal and as a receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.409" offset="1169011">The charge to the jury, we say, was erroneous and should not have been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.142" offset="1187924">We say that the jury should have been so instructed that they could have found Mike and Virginia Milanovich guilty as a principal under the larceny statute or as a receiver of the stolen property, not both.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.232" offset="1248319">The charge is given to the jury was, as I quote, "I might say in passing, that if they did participate as aiders and abettors that they may be found guilty as principals, then as to the count as to receiving.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="301.579" offset="1309654">Now of course, if they had actually removed the contents of the safe themselves, they cannot be guilty of receiving those same contents, but the evidence is clear in this case that either Mike Milanovich or Virginia Milanovich actually had their hands on the safe or removed any money from any safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.286" offset="1392515">The Court is drawing a fine line of distinction, saying the fact that they were principals in the theft, that they could also be guilty of receiving the stolen property, because they did not touch the loot at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.330" offset="1448730">Yet it's inconceivable to think that these two individuals, if they did participate as they did by driving the three thieves to the scene and had the loot and transported to their automobile at that time, then it would have been split the five ways at that time, then there'd be a clearcut case and no question would've been raised by the District Court nor would we be here today."</text>
            <text syncTime="358.080" offset="1535666">But, here, they are present and certainly if they were present and as drivers of the gateway vehicle or the transportation, they certainly expected to participate in the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.215" offset="1588224">And even though there were some two weeks delay in the actual receipt apart of the money and of course, as it might say in passing, the other $13,000 has never been accounted for, has never been found, only the $1000 in coins, which could not be removed at the time, has been recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.187" offset="1664084">And we say that they expected to participate in the loot and the interven -- intervention of the time has no bearing whatsoever, that it is one offense and one alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.976" offset="1715284">The fact that they were tried on the charge of -- of receiving as well as the principal, we in the lower court, asked constantly that the -- the prosecution elect.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.592" offset="1769723">Of course the judge said, "It could not be and rightly so."</text>
            <text syncTime="420.311" offset="1784665">But the jury should have been instructed that their verdict of guilty, if they found either the defendants guilty, would be that of either the receiving or as a principal.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.428" offset="1901066">We feel that in the case of Com -- Commonwealth versus Haskins, a Massachusetts case in 1880, where a person was found guilty of stealing a cow and having the cow in his possession, was found guilty of both offenses and the Court at that time, the District Attorney -- Commonwealth's attorney asked that the case be now cross as to receiving, the trial judge so upheld it, but the court of -- the Supreme Court of Appeals in Massachusetts reversed the case saying that the verdict was inconsistent in law and therefore, no judgment could be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.464" offset="2041187">And we say the same in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.329" offset="2048711">It was up to the jury to decide which count they were guilty of.Virginia Milanovich was given ten years for the larceny, five, for the receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.170" offset="2096044">The evidence is such that the jury, had he been properly instructed, may have found that the evidence was more credible as to the receiving count and would have found her guilty of that alone, rather than the larceny.</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.619" offset="7681860">I think three minutes will be sufficient for this second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.544" offset="7697533">The second point which is in the case before the Court is one which affects both convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.356" offset="7716760">But the only one which affects the conviction of the petitioner, Mike Milanovich, simply stated the position of the petitioners in this point, is that once having excluded prospective witnesses from the courtroom, it was error for the trial judge not to make this exclusion effective by failing to admonish them not to discuss their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.530" offset="7809442">At the early stages of the case before the first witness was called upon the request of the counsel for the defendants, the judge excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.019" offset="7843401">The trial judge excluded the witnesses from the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.636" offset="7857925">The further request of counsel for the defendants that the witness be admonished not to discuss their testimony with each other before they had testified or to discuss the testimony which had already been given with witnesses who already had testified, was denied by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.309" offset="7928560">His ruling appears on the record at pages 33 and again at pages 50 to 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.795" offset="7958549">Now of course, we concede that exclusion of witnesses from the trial of courtroom in civil and criminal cases as a matter of discretion for the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.596" offset="7997733">But without a very good reason, it appears logical and it would appear that logic alone would require that once having exercised is right and his discretion to exclude witnesses from the courtroom that the judge ought to have a very good reason not to make his exclusion effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.449" offset="8081220">I think if the Court will refer to the ruling of the Court of Appeals in this case, which is at page 344 of the record, you will note the Court of Appeals although not reversing the conviction on this point, point it out that we wish to indicate our view, this is halfway down the first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.431" offset="8145063">"We wish to indicate our view that ordinarily when a judge exercise his discretion to exclude witnesses, it would seem proper for him to take the further step of making the exclusion effective."</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.448" offset="8189158">In fact, what the trial judge did in this case was not to exercise any discretion as to decline to instruct witnesses to give them this admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.958" offset="8231163">The trial judge as appears on pages 33 of the record, when the request was made, pointed out to counsel for the defendants, "I do not think the Court can possibly police such a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.444" offset="8293125">The fine points of questioning or matters of course that are relevant that there is not much I can do about such situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.003" offset="8319352">Despite my size, the trial judge continues I'm only one man and I cannot be in more than one place at a time."</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.549" offset="8345579">Again at page 50, the trial court says, "Mr. Kutulakis, I cannot be a policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.103" offset="8371806">The witnesses have been separated, but there is no law at anytime which prohibits them from talking to anyone -- prohibits anyone from talking to the witnesses."</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.385" offset="8408900">We submit the trial court erred in saying that there was no law that prohibited the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.213" offset="8432201">The trial court could have made such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.880" offset="8442859">This Court has sanctioned the punishment of -- of contempt for the violation of such ruling in the Holder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.397" offset="8468982">The trial court has the authority, the discretion if it wishes, for the violation of such a rule to exclude the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.693" offset="8502105">Now, we submit that it's analogous to the case of Charles versus the United States, which is reported at 215 F.2d, at page 828, where the District Court of Hawaii had refused to issue a rule excluding witnesses because we don't do that anymore it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.406" offset="8584965">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit pointed out that this was not reason enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.922" offset="8603042">It's a matter that's addressed to the discretion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.511" offset="8617462">We submit that in -- particularly in the case of this type, where it's all accomplished testimony that the rule should have been issued.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. F. Bishop</label>
            <text syncTime="2140.807" offset="8666572">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.994" offset="8679320">On both of the issues presented for petitioners, I looked at some of the record and maybe of assistance here, see what happens, see which witnesses testified to which facts, what instructions were asked for, when they were to asked for and what instructions were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.999" offset="8755388">Preliminarily as to the point just argued with respect to the witnesses, Government's position is relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.852" offset="8786735">That is, we know of no rule promulgated by this Court and the federal rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.709" offset="8810245">We know of no congressional enactment, no constitutional provision and no decisions, which are sought to circumscribe the discretion of a trial judge in dealing with witnesses in a particular case, under the particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.916" offset="8879000">And with a look at the record, I believe we will show that there was not something of the type of the Charles case, where the port abdicated its function, but that was here an exercise the discretion by a judge, whom we perhaps, can't even evaluate on the pulled record who had a difficult problem, some 50 to 70 witnesses and did what it could about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.651" offset="8970010">But we'll get back to that with the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.897" offset="8978996">Returning also preliminarily to the first point with respect to Virginia Milanovich alone that has been explored rather extensively by the Court and what has been suggested by the Court of course, is the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.306" offset="9040645">Virginia Milanovich was convicted of aiding and abetting, the three safecrackers, who went on to the Naval Base and also of assisting in their escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.357" offset="9092786">On that count, separate instructions were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.329" offset="9112639">There were separate facts we submit and there was a separate verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.106" offset="9131760">We don't have the problem here of a general verdict of a jury where we have any doubt as to what the jury found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.339" offset="9152763">There were two separate verdicts on the two separate counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.300" offset="9164570">Now, the second count as has been observed by members of the Court was the count of receiving and concealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.065" offset="9195604">Dealing with a matter some two weeks later and relating only to one of these safecrackers who gave some of the money to Virginia Milanovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.875" offset="9230921">Now, as to that count and as to the instruction on that count, issue was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.437" offset="9261119">And as to that issue, we are not here discussing a question of multiple sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.723" offset="9282226">That sentence on the receiving count has been vacated and we know of no challenge of any of the instructions, the separate instructions if you please, on the aiding and abetting of larceny, so that we end a familiar case which has appeared before this Court, perhaps some numbers of times, but one count being bad, that has been separately handled, not on a question of fact or any inconsistency of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.044" offset="9391522">There is no question that both of these things happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.874" offset="9402911">That Virginia Milanovich did both of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.052" offset="9415555">The question is -- has -- as has been suggested, the question of law and that maybe noted that the Court of Appeals below did not set aside the sentence on receiving in any idea, without reaching at all, the question that there was inconsistency of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.597" offset="9493713">But solely, on the basis that in and their interpretation of the statute, they felt that the rule of this Court and Heflin applied and that there could be only one punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.586" offset="9537703">And accordingly, set at the receiving, sentence aside and with that, we insist that all has been done for her that needs to be done.</text>
