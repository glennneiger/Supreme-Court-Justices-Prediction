            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="33.130" offset="235917">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="denis_hurley" startTime="33.430" stopTime="175.805">
            <label>Mr. Denis Hurley</label>
            <text syncTime="33.430" offset="237066">-- Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice and -- and members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.741" offset="274369">In connection with Mr. Kiendl's leaving yesterday I said I would readily consent to what he did say that he wished he could stay here to hear my argument so he could keep me within the bounds of fairness but he said if he left, he felt that I would have to even more fair because this Court would move and then protect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.608" offset="357752">This is the fifth time that a problem arising in this judicial inquiry in Kings County, New York has come before this Court, the second time that oral argument has been permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.286" offset="408534">Therefore, I -- I mention that because I think therefore I need not dwell on the nature of this judicial inquiry or its scope or its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.747" offset="454405">Indeed, I think Mr. Kiendl yesterday made a very fair summary statement of the background of the inquiry and of the facts in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.306" offset="504560">In the light of yesterday's argument by Mr. Kiendl, I think there are just a few points that I would like to touch on and -- and clear up.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.406" offset="548968">One, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York is the Court that's vested with a plenary power by statute and inherent power as -- as it has been ruled over the admission and the discipline of lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.845" offset="642800">And in that connection, I would like to say in answer to a question that was asked yesterday that the Appellate Division has nothing to do with the grand jury, nothing to do with any grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.543" offset="697553">It has no power to impanel a grand jury or to direct a criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.403" offset="725034">That in New York and particularly in the City of New York and Kings County is for the county court which has criminal jurisdiction and is handled by the District Attorney who is an independent elected public official and not strictly subject to the Appellate Division.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="175.805" stopTime="179.985">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="175.805" offset="806640">Does the District Attorney play any part in these matters?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="denis_hurley" startTime="179.985" stopTime="199.691">
            <label>Mr. Denis Hurley</label>
            <text syncTime="179.985" offset="823359">In -- he -- he -- even before this judicial inquiry started, the District Attorney was conducting on his own a so-called ambulance chasing investigation into corrupt -- alleged -- allegedly corrupt lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.053" offset="887620">That's absolutely independent of the judicial inquiry.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="199.691" stopTime="202.639">

          <turn speaker="denis_hurley" startTime="203.830" stopTime="363.613">
            <label>Mr. Denis Hurley</label>
            <text syncTime="203.830" offset="918653">None.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.058" offset="919594">As a matter of fact, he -- he's -- he's conducted his own investigation proceeded against lawyers on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.602" offset="953762">And then in some few instances on the recommendation of the Justice presiding at the judicial inquiry, the Appellate Division has referred some of these matters arising out of the inquiry to the District Attorney for possible criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.054" offset="1027636">But once he gets in the hands of the District Attorney, we have nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.103" offset="1043832">As a matter of fact, all the judicial inquiry does is investigate and then the Justice presiding reports to the Appellate Division and the Appellate Division either takes no action or it recommends disciplinary action or it recommends criminal action in which event the matter goes to the District Attorney and then it's entirely up to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.115" offset="1139858">So that there's no investigation as such by us into crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.693" offset="1170160">That's in another problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.657" offset="1181968">The Appellate Division Inquiry called the judicial inquiry here is mainly into so-called "ambulance chasing" in the all accepted sense of that term and it's into unethical conduct of lawyers violation of the rules of court which prime facie constitute professional misconduct, inquiry into the Canons of Ethics as to whether there's been any violation and only incidentally into crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.857" offset="1298787">I'll come to a case later, the leading case in New York on this matter People ex rel. Karlin against Culkin where the opinion was written by Chief Judge Cardozo.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.565" offset="1345599">And he points out the distinctions between the judicial inquiry and a particular investigation into crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.670" offset="1374020">In other words, sometimes, we hid upon crime but most of the offenses are less than criminal, less than penal.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.245" offset="1420309">Now, the next point that was raised yesterday is the question of the ground upon which this lawyer predicated his refusal to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.579" offset="1477674">Now, the refusal of the attorney in this case to answer questions was grounded upon the state constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.039" offset="1519574">That's Article 1 Section 6 of the New York State Constitution and not under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="363.613" offset="1557817">I thought he raised both, Mr. Hurley.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="denis_hurley" startTime="366.290" stopTime="685.062">
            <label>Mr. Denis Hurley</label>
            <text syncTime="366.290" offset="1568580">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.593" offset="1569729">Well, he -- he raised -- if Your Honor would care to look at the record, page 61 and 62, there's the whole answer of the lawyer to the petition for the discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.711" offset="1638170">And on page 61, he answers the -- the petition which contain the specifications by admitting the first 22 paragraphs of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.424" offset="1689057">He denied paragraph 23rd which is the paragraph where we say that by his refusals to answer, he breached his inherent duty as a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.218" offset="1724270">He wasn't candid and frank with the Court and he frustrated the Court in its inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.115" offset="1763871">Then he goes on and affirmatively alleges an affirmative defense, which I take to be the soul issue in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.953" offset="1799189">And under that affirmative defense, he pleads his right to self-incrimination under this New York State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.482" offset="1841298">That's the top of page 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.039" offset="1851538">He cites the cases of the Court of Appeals up to that time that he relies on and then he says that there's been a denial of due process to him in violation of his rights under the Constitution of the State of New York and under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, claiming also a penalty hardship and forfeiture and also the last paragraph that the right to practice law is a right of liberty and property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.702" offset="1978180">Nowhere is there any allegation either in the pleading or in the testimony of -- of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.267" offset="2016423">And also in answer to a question yesterday, we do not investigate federal crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.319" offset="2044635">This is a state inquiry by the Court and there's no such claim of federal crimes asserted anywhere in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.028" offset="2079535">Now, on -- on that score and in opposing the grant of certiorari in this case, we conceded that the petitioner had asserted the claim of depravation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.953" offset="2147140">But, as I've said, he made no claim under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.808" offset="2174621">The Court of Appeals in its amended remittitur conceded also petitioner's assertion of depravation of Fourteenth Amendment due process but held that his rights had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.747" offset="2242330">Therefore, in opposing the grant of certiorari in this case, we argued one, that the non-federal grounds upon which the New York courts rely were entirely adequate to support the final order of disbarment and two, the petitioner's claim of depravation of Fourteenth Amendment due process is insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.026" offset="2335431">So that the question that was actually resolved here, as I see it, as the opinions of the courts, I think, very clearly demonstrate, the question that was actually resolved was whether there was any conflict between the New York statute namely Section 90 of the judiciary law pertaining to disciplinary proceedings of lawyers and the provision of the New York State Constitution against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.789" offset="2478477">That was the soul question that was determined by the courts of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.727" offset="2498330">Now, in this connection, I would like to emphasize because I think this is a question that's related to some of the other matters that have been before this Court and were argued only yesterday, Anastaplo and Konigsberg that in New York, the underlying question in this case was decided 32 years ago in 1928 by the Court of Appeals and that's the opinion I referred to a minute ago by Chief Judge Cardozo where a lawyer was held in contempt of court for refusing to answer proper legal questions in New York's first judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.617" offset="2677844">Now, the lawyer there did not plead self-incrimination but he attacked the whole judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.237" offset="2708355">He said that there was no power in the Court to conduct such an investigation into lawyers and that there had to be charges -- complaints and charges and so on but a general preliminary investigation, he claimed, could not be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.489" offset="2781288">So therefore, he refused to be sworn and he refused to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.165" offset="2804067">And he was held in contempt for refusing, the bare refusing to testify in that landmark case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Denis Hurley</label>
            <text syncTime="815.738" offset="3366327">No, it wasn't -- it wasn't in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.796" offset="3378552">But I think it's most interesting in the light of the claim that's made here that there, we have the law on the refusal of a lawyer to talk to the Court that admitted him and the Court that has disciplinary power over him in -- in its investigation into the conduct or misconduct of lawyers that there, we have that case which has been the law of New York for 32 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.208" offset="3488162">But not only that, Judge Cardozo, in that case, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has indicated, and we all well know, he traced the history of the Court's supervisory control over lawyers back to the New York State Constitution of 1777.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.108" offset="3567783">And beyond that, for over 300 years to England and to the authority of the Inns of -- of Court over lawyers and then the Inns of Court intern visited by the judges and of course, as we know in the history of that, Mr. Judge Cardozo's so-called a scholarly points out even as to the cut of the beard and -- and the clothes that the -- the lawyers wore so that the -- the question of the refusal to answer, according to Chief Judge Cardozo, went back over 300 years in England and then was incorporated in the Constitution of the State of New York in 1777.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.276" offset="3748446">So that until now, we haven't had a lawyer refused to answer a question put by the Court in an inquiry by the Court into the prevalence of unethical conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.254" offset="3820440">But it said now that this case is different because this attorney based his refusal to answer upon the plea of self-incrimination in reliance upon the New York State Constitution only.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.492" offset="3873311">That I say is a state question.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.102" offset="3883760">But the courts of New York have refused to recognize that claim difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.360" offset="3904763">And they've held that an attorney's refusal to answer, no matter what the ground, is a breach of the attorney's inherent duty to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.221" offset="3944260">It's an obstruction of the Court's investigation and it's a defiance of the Court's plenary power and control over lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.362" offset="3980831">And that in refusing to answer, the lawyer frustrates the investigation and renders the Court impotent to perform its statutory and inherent responsibilities in the cleansing of the bar and in the disciplining of lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.524" offset="4053452">Now, in reaching that conclusion, as I see it, the courts of New York were meticulous in pointing out that the attorney was not deprived of his constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.522" offset="4109458">Indeed, the right to invoke his privilege was upheld and -- and sustained in all three courts of New York that the additional special term at the Appellate Division and in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.558" offset="4169644">Therefore, New York ruled that this attorney was a court of the fullest measure of his constitutional guarantee against incriminating himself by his own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.016" offset="4211440">The New York State Constitution guarantees nothing more than self-protection against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.327" offset="4240697">It doesn't guarantee that he may not be subject to indictment, prosecution or conviction through the testimony of other persons nor does the Constitution guarantee that he may defy the authority of the courts in its proper investigation or that he may not be disciplined for remaining silent when it is his special duty as an officer of the Court to speak out forthrightly with candor and frankness in response to the Court's judicial inquiry into misconduct at the bar.</text>

            <label>Mr. Denis Hurley</label>
            <text syncTime="1448.309" offset="5896652">Possibly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.060" offset="5903653">As a matter of fact -- in -- arising from our proceeding, I think there were probably five or six cases now in four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.123" offset="5947852">One lawyer was acquitted and later disbarred and disciplinary though.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.850" offset="5970735">Two lawyers got six months in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.993" offset="5983378">They pleaded to a misdemeanor and others pleaded guilty to felonies and consented to disbarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.947" offset="6019114">So six were dispose up today in four years in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.038" offset="6035519">So that, you see, the great majority of the cases involved are something other than crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.765" offset="6062477">And that, of course, we have the -- the problem of -- of whether -- in the -- in the criminal courts of having to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt whereas we have the -- the weight of evidence, the preponderance of the evidence in the disciplinary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.697" offset="6134157">I should like to point out and I think this is important here is -- whether in some of these other cases that this case, as I conceive it, points up too sharply conflicting views of the role of the lawyer in American society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.057" offset="6215555">And I think the real question that's presented in this case involves the true status of the American lawyer or if you -- if one would prefer more modern current Madison Avenue style, the true image that should be projected of the lawyer, by the courts and by the bar, not the lawyer of fiction or TV or movies or the comics but the -- the real honest to goodness image as lawyers and -- and judges know he should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.186" offset="6368110">In other words, is he just a plain American citizen with no more obligations or no additional burdens or responsibilities, and the ordinary citizen?</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.628" offset="6405935">Is he only as he's claimed here by the opposition only a bear licensee of the State or is he something more?</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.702" offset="6442193">Now, I think this Court and the courts of New York have indicated more and more that the true role of the lawyer is more in the nature of a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.424" offset="6497050">And I think if that's considered for a few moments, you'll see how -- how that works out with every element as I -- as I conceive it of -- of a trust involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.436" offset="6553161">And it seems to be the judgment of the -- of the courts of New York that when a lawyer, as I said before, is called to the witness stand, he comes there in two distinct capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.720" offset="6594226">First, as a citizen, with all the rights and privileges and duties of a citizen, but beyond that, he appears as a lawyer with all of the rights and privileges of the lawyer and also all of the stern duties and solemn responsibilities of his lawyerhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.034" offset="6663502">So that we think he's -- and the courts of -- of New York have said and this Court has repeatedly emphasized in -- in various opinions involving lawyers that he's more than a -- a mere licensee and more it came through a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.077" offset="6731630">So that we -- we work that out in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.053" offset="6743542">That when a lawyer is admitted to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.563" offset="6757648">He presents himself for admission and he is admitted to the bar, the effect seems to be that the court, the admitting court is representing to society at large that here is an honorable man worthy of the public's trust and confidence, worthy to uphold the honor of the profession and as its officer, the dignity of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.646" offset="6849912">So that when a lawyer takes the oath, as happened here this morning, takes the oath, whether in this Court or any other court in the land, he is held out and certified by the admitting court as a person in whom the Court places its special confidence and in whom the public may trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.319" offset="6932668">That certainly consistent with what Chief Justice Hughes said some years ago that the practice of the profession of the law is the privilege administration of a public trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.328" offset="6980733">And I think it's upon the basis of that -- of that certification, that representation by the Court that in every specific case that the lawyer handles, his clients confined the most precious causes to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.086" offset="7047711">They trust in him even though they never met the lawyer before and they put in his hands because they trust him on the representation by the Court and holding out by the Court, they entrust him with the defense of their properties and their liberties and their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.331" offset="7116675">And in a broader sense, may I suggest to this Court, in a broader, in a more general sense, as I conceive it, every lawyer is also a trustee of the vast rich heritage of the common law, of all of our statutory law and of all that the law stands for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.646" offset="7201938">So that I submit that upon admission, a lawyer in reality becomes a trustee of the law and the Court appoints him as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.682" offset="7250108">You have a trust grieves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.012" offset="7263378">You have the great body of the law that was so eloquently described by Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.374" offset="7288874">You have the public as the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.120" offset="7303816">You have the Court as the creator or the secular of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.322" offset="7324609">Now, you have a lawyer as the trustee and he's called in by the very court that admitted him and it has the power to discipline him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.796" offset="7354598">He's called in to give an accounting of his stewardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.809" offset="7370585">He may refuse to answer, that we conceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.275" offset="7384482">He may invoke his privilege and his plea must be sustained if he invokes his constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.474" offset="7417292">But the courts of New York said, in failing to account, for his failure to account, he forfeits his trusteeship in the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.582" offset="7453654">And in this case, the Court's decree that petitioner by failing to account for his professional conduct could be stood no longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.483" offset="7493256">Now, carrying the analogy further, where a court ousts a trustee for refusal to render his account, he comes in, he's told to render his account, whether he is a testamentary trustee or whether he is a trustee of a living trust and he refuses to account under a claim of constitutional privilege, I submit, that a claim of depravation of due process has no validity in such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.089" offset="7615718">Certainly to prevent his removal, the trustee cannot insist that the beneficiaries must -- as this claimed here, must in the first instance prove an affirmative case against him of wrongdoing against the trustee before he must come forward with his account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.123" offset="7683845">And the right to specific charges and prove to confronta -- confrontation on cross-examination of witnesses, I submit, is beside the point where there is an absolute duty in the first instance of coming forward with the true account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.163" offset="7744031">I gather my time is up.</text>
