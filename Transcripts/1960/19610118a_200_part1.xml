            <label>Mr. Trayton L. Lathrop</label>
            <text syncTime="10.968" offset="147205">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.342" offset="160789">This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin which was entered on April 5, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.401" offset="196942">This action involves the validity of rules of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin which requires that persons, who practice law in the State of Wisconsin, join, belong to and support an association of attorneys known as the State Bar of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.241" offset="272384">Rules were adopted in the latter part of 1956 for a temporary period of two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.658" offset="297984">At the end of 1958, they were continued in effect, indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.441" offset="317106">This action was commenced in June of 1959 to recover from the treasurer of the association, dues which were paid to him under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.828" offset="358693">It’s contended that the rules violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.762" offset="382412">There was a demurrer to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.627" offset="389831">The Circuit Court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the action without leave to plead over.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.980" offset="419297">The -- upon appeal to the Supreme Court, that Court held that the rules do not violate the Fourteenth Amendment and affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.175" offset="460048">The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under Section 1257 (2) of title 28 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.347" offset="492753">The appellee asserts that there is no jurisdiction under said section on the ground that the rules of the Wisconsin Supreme Court do not constitute a statute under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.564" offset="537579">This Court has repeatedly held over a period of more than 75 years that the word statute, as it's used, touched in the appellate jurisdiction of this -- this Court, covers all acts of a legislature -- legislative nature to which the -- the Court -- which the State gives its sanction and enforces.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.521" offset="613439">For example, it is stated that a city ordinance constitutes a statute, that a rule of Board of Regents of the University governing the conduct of students constitutes a statute, that a constitutional provision constitutes a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.954" offset="683238">The -- the appellee asserts however that we have only a judicial act here.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.889" offset="710928">It is submitted what the appellee is -- is saying that is because of the nature of the body which creates the act that it is judicial rather than the nature of the act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.624" offset="753873">We submit that it is the nature of the act which controls legislative powers defined as the power to make laws and laws defined as the aggregate of those rules and principles of conduct which the governing body recognizes as those which are enforcing sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.530" offset="817507">So it is respectfully submitted that the rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin do constitute a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.612" offset="853870">We further state that Wisconsin Supreme Court itself, states that they are part of the police power, is exercised pursuant to the police power and they're exercised pursuant to the policy making functions of the Court, and not pursuant to a -- an adjudicatory function of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.566" offset="925654">He was attended by the -- I should say that the argument is going to be divided between Mr. Isaksen and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.698" offset="962121">Mr. Isaksen, will address himself to the free speech question and I will address myself to the question of freedom of association.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.036" offset="1035473">It was intended by the Wisconsin Supreme Court that the Integrated Bar Association be a continuation of the previously existing voluntary Wisconsin Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.035" offset="1083538">That attention has been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.634" offset="1093883">The Integrated Bar started out with the same general officers, the same executive director, the same property, the same files, the same magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.813" offset="1130663">The Court rules provided that the integrated association shall elect their delegates to the American Bar Association previously elected by the voluntary association.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.858" offset="1162846">Court rules provided that the integrated association shall elect the members of the state judicial council which were previously elected by the voluntary association.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.976" offset="1207254">The integrated -- the rules and bylaws refer to the integrated association as an association over 60 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.208" offset="1244244">The integrated association performs substantially the same functions and it's substantially the same manner as did the voluntary association and as does -- does the American Bar Association as it is alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.645" offset="1293981">Complaint alleges that more than -- they're -- one of the main objects and purposes of the integrated association have been to promote law reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.783" offset="1326477">Complaint alleges that the association makes and opposes proposals for changes in laws and constitutional provisions as the court systems, systems of selecting judges, text codes, corporate codes, property laws, criminal codes, laws among nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.672" offset="1390111">And that the association has used its funds in opposition to the adoption of legislation favored by the plaintiff, contrary to the plaintiff's convictions and beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.148" offset="1427937">The law reform activities of the association extend to the United States Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.807" offset="1442565">It had laws to the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.114" offset="1451865">A special subcommittee has been created for -- for federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.178" offset="1472136">The Wisconsin Supreme Court and in the opinion below, took judicial notice of the activities of the association in the legislative field and stated that in every instance, legislative measures advocated or opposed, have dealt with the administration of justice, court reform and legal practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.908" offset="1542980">Since the court below took judicial notice and went beyond the complaint, this Court is entitled to take judicial notice of the same facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.361" offset="1572864">A certified copy of the minutes of the Board of Governors and of the Executive Committee of the State Bar of Wisconsin, have been deposited with the clerk of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.286" offset="9472502">A compulsory bar was not justified in Wisconsin and it is not existing as a means of disciplining the members of the Bar or educating the members of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.601" offset="9521821">It was not justified by the Supreme Court and it's not existing for the purpose of protecting the public from any incapacity on the part of the members of the Bar or any fraud or any deception or anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.422" offset="9581066">What the Supreme Court did say in regard for the justification for this compulsory bar was this, and I'm substantially quoting, "The public welfare will be promoted by securing and publicizing the composite judgment of the members of the Bar on matters directly affecting the administration of justice in the practice of law."</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.612" offset="9681795">It said further, "The general public and the legislature are entitled to know the opinions of the majority of the members of the Bar."</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.656" offset="9725994">It said, "The Court has determined that the public interest, that it is in the public interest, to have public expression of the views of a majority of the members of the Bar on these subjects."</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.720" offset="9782209">And it concluded that, "The compulsory bar could do this job much more effectively than could a voluntary bar."</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.237" offset="9820348">In other words, if the Court please, this compulsory bar is existing and justified for the express purpose by the Supreme Court which created it, of securing and publicizing the opinions of men on the number of the subjects that relate to the administration of justice or the practice of law or court reforms.</text>
