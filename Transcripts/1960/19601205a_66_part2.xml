            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="2277.382" offset="9212949">There were some questions asked of counsel for the Government that I think should be cleared up by record references.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.553" offset="9253595">The suggestion was made to the Court that it was wholly a defense theory that the agents of the Government were hitting the duct of the premises at 408 21st Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.573" offset="9305631">The record doesn't bear this out because, at page 144 of the record and 145, it's shown that Officer Stone said, and I cite the bottom of page 144 that, in response to a question, "Now, when you penetrated with your mic, you penetrated at the point of the heat duct, did you not?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.340" offset="9400717">"Possibly, yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.881" offset="9406882">Then, over at 145, "And you thought you were going in at a point where the duct was, did you not?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.064" offset="9431646">Answer, "I had an idea that might be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.584" offset="9445752">Yes, sir, and the duct at 408 filled the part of what otherwise would have been a party wall, did it not?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.046" offset="9467591">"That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.972" offset="9471248">It was inserted into the wall."</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.970" offset="9479293">And that particular duct was a duct that serviced 408 exclusively, did it not?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.725" offset="9498311">And, he answered, "That's correct."</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.687" offset="9506147">Now, at page 158, if the Court please, a reading of the colloquy at page 158 where the same witness is under examination, I cannot but to suggest to the Court that he believed, although it was difficult to get him to admit that he was penetrating at a point where he was touching the duct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.883" offset="9590888">He says, at the bottom of page 58, after several questions at 158, "I believe I did state that I thought of the possibility that the mic was contacting the duct on the other side."</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.820" offset="9638640">And, at page 160, the question is put, "Now, you testified," and I'm reading from two-thirds of the way down, "in answer to a question by Mr. Williams, you knew you didn't think you were hitting brick when you came into this object, isn't that correct?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.948" offset="9711156">Answer, "It didn't feel like a brick wall, no, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.949" offset="9723173">Question, "What did it feel like to the best of your memory?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.122" offset="9735816">"Well, there was a sleight, slight bit of give, a slight before it stopped."</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.925" offset="9759117">The record is absolutely uncontradicted, if the Court please, that the only place where this needled could penetrate is was for a nine-inch stretch under the baseboard of that wall, precisely in front of the heating duct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.585" offset="9821706">Mr. Chief Justice asked the counsel for the Government if there was anything in the record to show how far this needle had to be inserted before it touched the duct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.221" offset="9864234">The rec -- the record is entirely clear on this, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.442" offset="9881161">I direct your attention to page 215 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.377" offset="9900910">Page 215, Question, and I'm reading from about one-fourth of the way down, "Will you tell His Honor and the jurors the measurements that you found when you measured that distance including the shoe molding, the baseboard, and then the plain airspace."</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.180" offset="9972067">We found we had to go in seven and a half inches -- seven and an eighth inches to touch that duct -- the back of that duct."</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.202" offset="10000175">Seven and an eighth inches counting what sir, counting the shoe mold and the baseboard, yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.160" offset="10020028">At 220, that testimony is repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.322" offset="10040613">Halfway down, "Now, I believe you testified there came a time when you went to 410 21st Street and you insul -- inserted a coat hanger or a spike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.902" offset="10078960">You had to put this object seven and a half inches from the lip of the toe molding to touch what you referred to as the back of the duct, is that correct?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.220" offset="10108217">Answer, "I believe I said seven and an eighth inches, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.403" offset="10120965">"Seven and an eighth?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.515" offset="10125458">"Yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.113" offset="10127862">Again, at page 234 and 235, if the Court please, that testimony is repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.594" offset="10153775">If you will look at the very top sentence at the page 235, you will see that it was seven and an eighth inches that this spike had to penetrate in order to touch the duct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.669" offset="10198079">Again, the record speaks contrary to what counsel for the Government says when he says that it's silent with respect to whether this had to come in contact with the surface in order to be effective because, at page 200 -- I'm sorry, at page 156, it's entirely clear from the record that this had to touch something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.945" offset="10299120">From the testimony of the Government's own witnesses, two-thirds of the way down, Question, "Well, will you explain it to me again then, please, because I didn't understand?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.711" offset="10346245">Answer, "I said from my knowledge of this instrument, it should be in contact, that the point should be in contact with some surface which would act as a sounding board to pick up the sound waves and transmit the sound waves to the needle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.577" offset="10405700">The needle does not have to be embedded into that object so long as there is a contact."</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.078" offset="10431718">Also, the record is very clear, if the Court please, that the fact is they could hear conversations from all over the house at 408 21st Street, petitioner's dwelling house."</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.356" offset="10480828">Page 97 of the record and, again, it's the Government's own witnesses, at the very bottom, "Now, where did Mr. Menendez and Mr. Martin conversed?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.825" offset="10522624">Answer, "I couldn't tell you exactly where they conversed because I was not in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.351" offset="10540805">I could not tell you exactly where they conversed because I was not in the premises of 408 but, it seems to me, they were conversing in the room on the first floor, on the first floor of the building, I would say and, mind you, they were on the second floor when they conducted their electronic surveillance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="2629.364" offset="10620844">Then, again, at page 98, question, "Is it your testimony that this microphone on the second floor picked up conversations on the first floor?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.219" offset="10656266">Answer, "That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.425" offset="10661073">I would say that."</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.819" offset="10666611">Again, at page 99, if the Court please, "Now, on the occasion that you were there with Detective Stone when you inserted the spike microphone and Mr. Menendez was present in the other house with Mr. Martin, you were in this front bedroom, were you not?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.014" offset="10723453">"That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.676" offset="10726066">I was in the front bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.056" offset="10731604">That was on the second floor."</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.977" offset="10743306">Again, if the Court please, at page 100, question, "Did you go downstairs when you found that Mr. Menendez and Mr. Martin were conversing downstairs?</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.409" offset="10784998">Did you go downstairs and insert your microphone?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.889" offset="10794924">Answer, "No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.623" offset="10797850">It was not necessary to go downstairs to insert the microphone."</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.663" offset="10814046">So, I say that it's accurate and there are other references here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.027" offset="10827525">Again, at page 101 and 104, that they were using the sound -- the elec -- the heat conductor system of 408 is a giant sound conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.976" offset="10871306">There was nothing else there for this needle to touch except the -- the metal heating duct it gave, and it gave them auditory observation of all of the premises at 408 21st Street by seven and one-eighth inch insertion into the party wall.</text>
