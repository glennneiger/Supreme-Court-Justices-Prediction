            <label>Mr. Richard E. Gorman</label>
            <text syncTime="29.675" offset="222124">I am Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.318" offset="268622">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.139" offset="295894">This prosecution was commenced on December the 13th, 1957 by the return of an indictment in four counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.072" offset="335705">These counts charged a violation of the Internal Revenue statutes for the years of 1951, 1952 and 1953 under the old Section 145 (b) and in 1954 under the applicable Section number 7201 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.557" offset="425566">The matter was tried to a court on the waiver of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.944" offset="447195">The amounts which were involved totaled approximately $700,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.496" offset="489305">There was a finding of guilty by the Court and special findings of fact pursuant to the provisions of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.907" offset="539042">These findings of fact were most detailed and fulsome and appear in both the brief of the United States and of the brief of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.288" offset="576554">In summary, it might be said that the petitioner, Eugene C. James was an official of the International Laundry Workers Union and also was the Secretary Treasurer of Local 46 of the International Laundry Workers Union in Chicago, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.168" offset="656071">The funds which were the subject matter of this embezzlement which was so found especially by the Court to be an embezzlement were funds which were contributed to a welfare -- a health and welfare organization within the international and within the local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.593" offset="729736">These funds were especially contributed by management of the various members of the union or for the benefit of the various members of the union and were then contributed to a special fund which was set up in Indianapolis, Indiana for the purpose of purchasing this health and welfare plan for the members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.648" offset="841958">The Mr. James was a Secretary Treasurer of the International Union as well as being a Secretary Treasurer of the Laundry Workers local number 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.592" offset="921788">The funds were diverted by Mr. James and one Mr. Saperstein who was an agent of the insurance company which was underwriting these health and welfare plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.664" offset="993991">The moneys were diverted to James and were set up in a special bank account in Chicago, Illinois and then were removed from that bank account by him, by the checks drawn to cash and in some instances checks drawn from his own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.106" offset="1055848">And they, in the bulk, set up the funds which, as I said, were the subject matter of this embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.769" offset="1098480">The Court in its findings of fact held that this money was embezzled money and it was upon this finding of fact that appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.284" offset="1168488">In its conclusions of law, the Court held that the lawyers -- that the financial or monitory gains to a taxpayer was a lawfully or unlawfully acquired, constitutes taxable income to the taxpayer in the year in which he had such control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.521" offset="1265455">That is a practical matter he derived readily realizable economic value from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.160" offset="1288025">It is immaterial whether the receipt of funds by a taxpayer without results from misappropriation, embezzlement, or other lawful or unlawful acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.742" offset="1330343">It is with the Court's opinion that the embezzled funds in this case constituted a gain, which was such a gain that it could be -- it could be considered subject to income tax that we take exception in this petition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.723" offset="1406307">This matter was first before this Court in the case of Internal Revenue Commissioner versus Wilcox, and it is interesting to note that in that case in Judge -- Justice Murphy's decision, in his opinion, he started out with these words, “The sole issue here is whether embezzled money constitutes taxable income to the embezzler under Section 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code.”</text>
            <text syncTime="358.784" offset="1538487">That is the exact same question that we appear before this Court for its decisions here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.514" offset="1565445">And it is also interesting to note that in that case practically the same argument was made by the Government as has been submitted to this Court in the briefs which are submitted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.640" offset="1617899">Since the time of the Wilcox case, no other decision has treated that case as being overruled and, except the decision in this case in the Seventh Circuit, there have been numerous decisions by courts, various circuit courts across the land, in which the decision in the Wilcox case has been distinguished but there is no case except the case in which we appear before Your Honors today in which it has been held that the Wilcox case is no longer controlling in cases concerning embezzled funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.574" offset="1789680">We wish to point out to this Court in answer to the assertions in the Government's brief that there has been no intension and there is no intension on our part to make an argument as to the illegality of the receipt of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.723" offset="1858226">Our contention is strictly this; that embezzled funds do not constitute a gain, a taxable gain, to the embezzler, and therefore, they have been held not to be income -- not to be subject to the income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.984" offset="1931264">The difficulty that seems to have arisen in connection with the cases which have been held or heard since the Wilcox decision is been the dicta which has been put forward by the various courts of appeal that is to the effect that the Rutkin case, a case subsequent to Wilcox, which was decided by this Court in 1954, pardon me in 1952, in some way overruled the Wilcox case.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.712" offset="2082252">To this argument, we can see no basis, because in the Rutkin case itself, in the opinion in the Rutkin case, this Court specifically stated that the Wilcox case was a case of embezzlement and that this Court left that case on its own facts and that the Rutkin case was a case of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.975" offset="2183293">Therefore, it would appear that there was a limitation which exists since the time of the Rutkin case but the Rutkin case in no way has extended the doctrine that was set forth in the Wilcox case that embezzled funds are not subject to income tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.667" offset="2294053">The James case since the Wilcox case, in our opinion, is the closest situation factually that we have since that case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.591" offset="2345775">In both the James case and then the Wilcox case, there was an actual embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.251" offset="2368345">In both the James case and then the Wilcox case, there was an active pursuit of the embezzler by local authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.492" offset="2401364">In the Wilcox case, the embezzler was pursuit by the local state authorities and was convicted of embezzlement and served time in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.554" offset="2445563">And I might say in passing here that in the James case, the same situation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.804" offset="2470640">There was returned in the State of New Jersey, a indictment charging both James and Saperstein with conspiracy to embezzle that indictment was in effect during the time of the existence of dependency of this case and it is only in this week that as a result of a plea of guilty before the Courts of the State of New Jersey, that the petitioner James here was sentenced to term of one to two years in the penitentiary on the conspiracy to embezzle indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.467" offset="2633226">All of the lower court decisions, which have been cited by the Government and which have been discussed by the various courts of appeals are in our opinion distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.797" offset="2694562">It might -- they are a fourth set out in our brief in detail and I will not burden the Court with a recitation of the facts in each one of those cases, but it is apparent in each one of those cases that there was an attempt made to come within the doctrine of the Wilcox case, but that that attempt was more of a legal stratagem than something that existed in reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.689" offset="2794141">And in all of those cases, the courts were able to distinguish the Wilcox case from the presentation of facts in those cases and it was held that they were not within the doctrine of the Wilcox case, because they were not in fact embezzlers but they were perpetrators of many other types of offences.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.029" offset="2879509">It's interesting if one of those cases, however, to point out that in the Prokop case, which was decided in the Seventh Circuit, that the Government itself in its brief, and this is pointed out in our brief on page 41, adopted the distinction and argued the distinction before the Court of Appeals between the Wilcox case and the Rutkin case and pointed out there that the Rutkin case was a case of extortion and that so was the Prokop case, a case of extortion, and that therefore Mrs. Prokop, who also happened to be a union official, could not bring herself within the doctrine of the Wilcox case because she just was in fact plainly not an embezzler.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="741.435" offset="3069158">Well, in principal, what is the difference between embezzlement and extortion so far in this context?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard E. Gorman</label>
            <text syncTime="748.937" offset="3099146">The – the -- difference is in the type of the events as we see it and as I think the courts have pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.441" offset="3145122">The embezzler, and this Court has recognized and almost all courts have recognized in approximate maybe 90% of the cases, is always detected.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.547" offset="3189530">The embezzler in many cases is a person who takes funds with the intent to restore them.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.495" offset="3217324">The embezzler in most every case, when he is caught up with so to speak, restitution has been a part of the penalty that attaches to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.996" offset="3271346">Whereas, with extortion we have the -- as the Court said itself, the unlikely act of repudiation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.529" offset="3317530">The extorter takes the money with a clear claim to that money so far as he is concerned as against the whole world and it is unlikely that the extortee would ever pursue him.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.618" offset="3385866">In embezzlement cases, we almost always have a pursuit; we almost always have a definite and an unconditional obligation to repay, which as this Court pointed out subsequent to the Rutkin decision, in the Alison decision of this Court was a very lively, was a very lively contingency, because in the Alison case this Court pointed out that a great deal of the money, which was embezzled from the Alisons was recovered by them and although that would be --</text>

            <text syncTime="862.709" offset="3554200">Do you think that any court had two cases, one of embezzlement and one of extortion would, under the same circumstances, order restitution from the embezzler and not from the extortionist?</text>

            <text syncTime="879.221" offset="3620237">Oh that well maybe, but the distinction which this Court made, if Your Honor please, was that the likelihood of their being any chance that the extorter would be called to test if that that is very unlikely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.407" offset="4481024">As we understand the petitioner's position here, it comes down to an assertion that unlawful gains of every character are taxable because the Rutkin case, in effect, held them to be taxable the bribes, the graft paid, the kickbacks, the gambling gains, the proceeds from illicit liquor, the whole long catalog of illicit games which have been held taxable, petitioner has no quarrel with, but he says that somehow this Court has carve or should carve in this case a privilege sanctuary for the embezzler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.866" offset="4626787">The embezzler should be free from tax while all the other recipients of their illicit gains must pay the income tax.</text>
