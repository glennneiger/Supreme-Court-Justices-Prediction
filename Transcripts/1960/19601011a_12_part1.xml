            <text syncTime="12.256" offset="152430">Mr. Abt, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="13.646" offset="157968">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.588" offset="185762">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.890" offset="194957">This case presents for review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirming an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board that the petitioner register as a Communist-action organization under Section 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.137" offset="271966">The Act was passed over the presence veto in September 1950, shortly after the outbreak of war in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.754" offset="306343">The order of the Board was issued in April 1953 after a hearing on a petition by the Attorney General and was accompanied by a report in which the Board stated its findings as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.525" offset="361514">On the first review, the Court of Appeals held the Act constitutional and affirmed the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.715" offset="394219">Judge Bazelon dissented holding the Act unconstitutional because it violates the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.333" offset="428701">This Court refers to 1956 without reaching any of the other questions presented because of the denial below of the petitioners' motion for leave to adduce evidence that three witnesses called by the Attorney General for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.819" offset="502680">Upon the remand of the case to the Board, the Attorney General did not contest the petitioners' allegations of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.409" offset="532982">Accordingly, the Board expunged the testimony of these three witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.174" offset="552103">After further proceedings, the Board issued a modified report and a recommendation that its order be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.236" offset="584286">On the second review in 1958, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board because of the latter's denial of petitioners' motions for the production of statements to government agencies by to of the Attorney General's witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.132" offset="655862">After further proceedings before the Board, the Board issued its modified report on second remand and again recommended affirmance of its registration order.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.340" offset="700688">The court below affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.395" offset="708942">Judge Bazelon again dissenting adhered to its original position on the constitutional question and further held that several procedural errors required another remand to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.799" offset="766516">The case presents to this Court questions of the highest public importance as to the constitutionality of the Subversive Activities Control Act and its construction and application.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.122" offset="819911">Additional questions relate to the sufficiency of the evidence and to what, in our review, were for major procedural errors by the Board of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.008" offset="867453">The first point that I shall argue is that the Act, on its face and as applied, violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.480" offset="901308">As I shall show under the guise of a registration statute, the Act represents an attempt without precedent in this country to enforce conformity by suppressing, advocacy, association and collective activity for wholly legitimate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.786" offset="986467">The Act provides for proceedings before the Board initiated on petitions of the Attorney General to determine whether accused groups are Communist-action, Communist-front or Communist-infiltrated organizations but to the Act, denominates collectively as Communist organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.810" offset="1070582">A Communist-action organization is defined in Section 3 (3) of the Act as an organization which, and I quote, "One is substantially directed, dominated or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement," referred to in Section 2 of this title and two, "Operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement," as referred to in Section 2 of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.077" offset="1195656">Section 2, which is, of course, item of Section 3 by virtue of the Section 3 definition, Section 2 finds that the world Communist movement referred to in the definition is directed and controlled by a foreign power, operates through the medium of a worldwide Communist organization composed of Communist-action organizations and has as its purpose the establishment of what the Act calls a Communist totalitarian dictatorship in all the countries throughout the world by means of espionage, sabotage, terrorism, treachery, deceit, infiltration to other groups and any other means deemed necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.305" offset="1372557">Communist-front and Communist-infiltrated organizations are defined in terms of their control by a Communist-action organization or its members and by their purpose of giving aid or support to a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.525" offset="1441520">Communist-action and Communist-front organizations are required to register as such with the Attorney General when a registration order becomes final upon the exhaustion of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.146" offset="1495960">Communist-infiltrated organizations are not required to register that are denied the benefits of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.536" offset="1529501">The registration statement of a Communist-action organization must list the names of its officers and all of its members give a detailed financial accounting and list of printing, mimeographing and similar duplicating facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.255" offset="1600345">Registration statements are open for public inspection and are required to be kept current by annual reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.840" offset="1630751">Members who are not listed in the registration statement of the organization are under a duty to register themselves after an administrative determination of their membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.358" offset="1676831">The failure of the officers to register the organization or the members to register themselves is punishable by five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine cumulative for each day that the failure to register continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.047" offset="1747571">In view of the findings of Section 2, a final registration order commence the organization to stigmatize itself and its members or the members to stigmatize themselves has participants in what amounts to a foreign controlled seditious conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.974" offset="1827297">A final registration order also automatically invokes a series of tripling sanctions against the organization and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.992" offset="1871391">All these sanctions, it's important to point out, become operative whether or not the organization or its members register in compliance with the registration order.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.017" offset="1927398">The sanctions are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.447" offset="1945161">First, the organization must label all publications which it distributes through the mails as those are a Communist organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.778" offset="1990510">Its broadcasts and telecasts must be preceded by a similar identifying announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.490" offset="2017364">This requirement, in our view, was plainly acquire -- requirement of self-defamation applies to all of the organizations, publications and broadcasts, no matter how legitimate their contempt maybe.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.911" offset="2075042">Section 10, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.726" offset="2086327">Second, it is unlawful for members of the organization to hold any non-elective federal office to hold employment of any kind in an enterprise which the Secretary of Defense has listed as a defense facility or to hold any office or employment in a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.851" offset="2162813">These provisions may close a door to virtually all employment opportunities for members.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.947" offset="2187160">Third, it is unlawful for members to apply for or use passports for any purpose including the most innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.892" offset="2226970">Fourth, it is unlawful for employees of the Government or of the defense facilities to contribute funds or services to the organization for any purpose whatsoever or even to subscribe to the publications of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.465" offset="2297187">Fifth, naturalized citizens who join the organization within five years after naturalization are subject to loss of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.417" offset="2333027">Alien members are to be excluded or deported and may not be naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.889" offset="2354970">Sixth and finally, the organization and its employees are excluded from a social security system.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.043" offset="2391542">The sanctions of the Act, with reference to labeling, employment, passports and contributions to the organization are all enforceable by the onerous criminal penalties imposed by Section 15 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.040" offset="2451519">All of these sanctions on the members are imposed exclusively because of their membership without regard to their personal influence -- innocence or lack of personal knowledge of any wrong doing whatsoever on the part of the organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.214" offset="2660185">The sanctions imposed by the Act on front organizations and their members differ from notes that I have described with preference to Communist-action organizations only in a few ameliorating details.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.442" offset="2713161">In the case of the petitioner, the member sanctions are not implying to persons who are its members by any conventional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.763" offset="2746389">They extend to a host of individuals who may be found to be members under Section 5 of the Communist Control Act, which establishes such vague and comprehensive standards for determining membership in the Communist Party and that we show in our brief and argue it here almost anyone can be found to be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.609" offset="2825801">A final registration order against petitioner will have further consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.581" offset="2845654">Any person who signs a registration statement or whose name is listed in it becomes a candidate for prosecution under the Smith Act and the extravagantly vague crime created by Section 4 (a) of this Act of conspiring, "To perform any act which would substantially contribute to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship under foreign control".</text>
            <text syncTime="711.286" offset="2948472">Furthermore, by branding the organization and its members as treasonable conspirators, registration order defames them, makes them social outcasts and threatens their ability to earn a livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.186" offset="3012106">Finally, the registration order will make it prohibitive for other groups and individuals to associate with the petitioner or its members or even to advocate legitimate social or economic use which they support.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.913" offset="3099042">I didn't say made it illegal, Your Honor, I said it made it dangerous for them to do so because by doing so, first of all, they may make themselves -- themselves members under the evidentiary indicia of Section 5 of the Communist Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.556" offset="3157556">And in addition, any group that engages in such association or advocate views similar to those advocated by the Communist-action organization, the petitioner risks condemnation under the Act as a front or infiltrated organization under the Act's standards for determining what front and the infiltrated organizations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.096" offset="3247731">The consequences of all these are at the registration order, quarantines the organization and -- and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.395" offset="3284929">Registration order also effectively deters the whole people from even considering, later on espousing any views of the organization advocates.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.023" offset="3327457">In the light of all these consequences of a registration order, it is idle to pretend, as a Government does here, that the Act it is nothing but a simple disclosure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.445" offset="3377194">No disclosure statute, a legitimate disclosure statute defames and imposes destructive penalties upon those who complied by making disclosure nor does it make registration an Act of self-exposure to criminal and civil liabilities created by the legislation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.261" offset="3468413">The Act makes that we think it was obviously intended to make registration impossible for if the organization registers, it destroys itself and jeopardizes the livelihood and liberty of its members, contributors and those who do business with it by listing their names for public scrutiny as members, contributors or persons having business dealings with a foreign control seditious conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.435" offset="3585128">For member registers, he destroys himself under the sanctions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.737" offset="3606340">On the other hand, failure to register exposes the officers and members an astronomical cumulative penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.059" offset="3639568">The order thus offers the organization or its members a Hobson's choice between suicide by registration and governmental execution for non-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.609" offset="3693798">Accordingly, the Act does not contemplate really that the order -- a registration order will be complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.971" offset="3731205">Consequence, the order will not and can't produce information because nobody can register under it and survive, but it results in its proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.957" offset="3767150">Its true function is to outlaw the petitioner, lay a basis for the mass prosecution of its members and establish the foundation for proscribing other organizations as fronts or infiltrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.440" offset="3829112">By outlawing the petitioner, the Act does not merely deter but proscribes all advocacy by and association with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.395" offset="3876968">Congress thought to reconcile these consequences with the First Amendment by finding in Section 2 that the Act was necessary to guard against, "A clear and present danger to the security of the United States," at Section 215.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.852" offset="3942797">The Act cannot be justified on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.951" offset="3959202">First place, it authorizes the entry of a registration order against an organization which has not been shown be endangering the national security in any way whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.304" offset="4012596">This appears in Section 3 of the Act, Section 3 (3) I should say, which defines a Communist-action organization in terms of two characteristics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.858" offset="6602794">Yet, they provide one of the basis for imposing the destructive liabilities and penalties of the Act simply because they are similar to views expressed by spokesmen for the Soviet Union in applying this criteria which the Board -- which the court below characterized "as furnishing one of the chief items of evidence in the case".</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.944" offset="6695163">The Board rested its finding adverse to the petitioner primarily on the fact that it and the Soviet Union advocated such legitimate and widely held views as of the Chiang Kai-shek Regime was reactionary and corrupt, that the People's Republic of China should be seated at the United Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.619" offset="6777814">That Syngman Rhee was a corrupt dictator and that prohibition of atomic weapons as advocated in the Stockholm Pledge was in the interest of world peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.707" offset="6822222">But the heresy of non-deviation from views like these can be penalized, then governmental control of political expression and association is indeed unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.010" offset="6871437">In fact, the ex-provisions concerning front and infiltrated the organizations as well as Section 5 of the Communist Control Act, already penalized offense of non-deviation from the views of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.073" offset="6939669">This, I think, is a technique of mercantilism which the nation rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.913" offset="6963075">Affirmance of the Act and the Board's order would resurrect and make it our national policy by freezing it into the law and arming it with intolerable sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.376" offset="7012916">The fact is that the Act would violate the First Amendment even if proof were required that an -- an accused organization was engaged in conduct endangering the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.154" offset="7071953">For the Act's restrains sound expression and association are far broader than necessary to meet any possible danger from such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.470" offset="7117302">As President Truman stated in his veto message, the Act attempts, and I quote, "To proscribe for groups such as the Communists certain activities which are perfectly proper for everybody else".</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.263" offset="7176443">For example, whatever else may be charged against the Communist Party, it concededly employs association in the advocacy, collective activity for legitimate political, social and economic objectives which many Americans share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.040" offset="7247496">Yet, by outlawing petitioner here, the Act suppresses this legitimate political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.689" offset="7278111">It does so not as unnecessary incident for the control of dangerous conduct, on the contrary, it is legitimate advocacy and legitimate association for a collective activity that the Act was designed to reach because there are already plenty of criminal statutes which punish espionage, sabotage and seditious conspiracy, seditious advocacy and provide for the registration of foreign agents and the Congress has overlooked any conduct injurious to the national security, it could easily make it punishable by legislation narrowly drawn for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.917" offset="7455013">Respondent argues that the Act is valid because of strikes at a grave evil -- evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.157" offset="7479986">The inference is that once Congress finds that an organization, like petitioner is dangerous, all of its advocacy and selective activity may be suppressed including that which is lawful and innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.823" offset="7534634">This is a theory of congressional power which says that Congress may toss an atom bomb, an H-bomb in the general direction of any evil that it finds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.892" offset="7582908">But due process prohibits Congress from what the military call over killing at least on constitutional rights for the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.456" offset="7633168">And the prohibition is even more stringent for the killing occurs within the area where the First Amendment grants asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.361" offset="7672769">Accordingly, use of the legislative H-bomb embodied in this Act cannot be validated without writing off the First Amendment and indeed, due process along with it as a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.600" offset="7737762">I turn now to the question of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.763" offset="7766392">The registration order requires petitioners' officers to perform an act, the signing and filing of petitioners' registration statement which constitutes an admission of their membership and officership in the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.740" offset="12746376">The majority of the court below held and the Government argues here that adjudication of the privilege is premature in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.389" offset="12776887">The argument is that the privilege must be claimed to be enjoyed, a petitioners' officers may never claim it and that those who so desire will have an opportunity to do so on a registration form to be supplied by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.750" offset="12834356">The Government never suggests, I may say that registration maybe accomplished without having somebody who knows the fact signs (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.673" offset="12874062">The Government's argument, I had to say its argument that privilege can be claimed on the registration form to be supplied by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.518" offset="12917426">That argument overlooks the crucial fact which makes the situation of the officers in this case unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.234" offset="12940309">The fact is that a claim of the privilege to the Attorney General is itself in an incriminating admission that the claimant is an officer of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.969" offset="12979284">The procedure which the Government suggests gives the officers an illusory choice to clean making the incriminating admission by signing and filing a registration statement and making the same admission by asserting our privilege not to file the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.116" offset="13043858">Since in the circumstances of this case to assert the privilege is to surrender it, its assertion cannot be made a condition to adjudication that the privilege protects the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.953" offset="13099133">Defendant also contends that the self-incrimination issue was premature because a claim of privilege, if and when asserted, might be found to have been waived by some of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.855" offset="13154826">Now, showing in our brief that none of the factors which the Government suggests might supply a waiver even if they were applicable to the persons, who were the petitioners' officers at the time of registration is required, would in fact waive the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.598" offset="13221804">But -- but apart from that and -- and more important than that, the question of waiver by a particular individual can arise only at the time when he asserts the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.897" offset="13266944">The Act, however, deprives the petitioners' officers of any opportunity for its assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.276" offset="13288469">Hence, the issue of waiver can never arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.195" offset="13304142">The Government also argues that if the claim of privilege is made by an officer in honor or by all the officers, the only result would be to make the registration order unenforceable and not void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.685" offset="13370075">This argument rests on the same clause premise as all the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.865" offset="13390869">Since the Act in the registration order necessarily conflict with the privilege by making the assertion of the privilege itself incriminating, the Act and the order are not only unenforceable on a particular case but avoid on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.585" offset="13449697">On our brief we show that all of the contentions of the Government, which I've just enumerated here, are squarely refuted by the decision of this Court in Boyd versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.157" offset="13499956">I can't take the time of my argument for the Court to go into that case if I refer the Court to our brief on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.322" offset="13540707">Finally, the Government contends on the authority of United States versus White, that the privilege does not protect the petitioners' officers against signing and filing the registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.845" offset="13594728">The White case is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.135" offset="13603924">It held that an officer of an organization is not privileged to withhold records of the organization on the claim that the contents of the record might incriminate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.274" offset="13648436">Here, it isn't the contents of the records but the admission of officership in the Communist Party which is incriminating and it is that admission that can't be compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.327" offset="13692635">Moreover, the decision in White was carefully limited to the production of the records themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.297" offset="13720534">This also appears from the Court's more recent decision in (Inaudible) versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.863" offset="13742791">The registration order, however, does not call for the production of organization records but for the preparation and filing for original statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.618" offset="13781870">It follows, therefore, that the privileges available to the officers and that --that its assertion in this proceeding is not premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.997" offset="13819382">Since registration, as I've shown, would very materially and -- and substantially injure the petitioner and has standing to challenge thus, the constitutionality of the requirement of the officers incriminate themselves by filing a registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.164" offset="13888031">Accordingly, as Judge Bazelon held, the statute could be held invalid as conflicting with the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.018" offset="14163466">I should like first to take up our point that the Act is unconstitutional because it deprives the petitioners' members of liberty and property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.105" offset="14219786">Now, Mr. Abt pointed out once the registration order becomes final, it outlaws the petitioner as an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.083" offset="14259702">And it's also clear, however, that the order will have catastrophic effects on the members of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.185" offset="14300139">First of all, their names and addresses have to be listed on a public register with the Attorney General as members of this organization that's been condemning as a foreign control seditious conspiracy and this register is open to public inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.982" offset="14379342">This is the same as making them wear an armband or making them wear a scarlet letter insofar as subjecting them to social ostracism, social appropriate and social reprisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.536" offset="14445484">Secondly, the Act subjects the members by its terms in special sanctions enforceable by criminal penalties.</text>
