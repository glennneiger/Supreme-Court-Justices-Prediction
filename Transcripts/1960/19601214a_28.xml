            <label>Mr. Edward Mosk</label>
            <text syncTime="11.850" offset="150758">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.353" offset="172805">We've had a somewhat unusual, I think, for the Court situation this afternoon in a situation of a petitioner speaking for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.147" offset="227976">I think perhaps in the Konigsberg case, we come in to a second somewhat unusual situation in that we have a case here for the second time on at least what from the point of view of the petitioner would seem to us to be almost identical facts as have already been determined by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.662" offset="334033">I, of course, am well aware of the theory under which the State of California acting through the Committee of Bar Examiners has brought this case before you a second time by declining to admit the petitioner after the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.607" offset="405817">So that I think that I should commence by reviewing the facts as they have occurred, bringing us down first to the present moment of this second Konigsberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.596" offset="469765">The Court will remember that on May 6th, 1957, this Court said about the petitioner without some authentic reliable evidence of unlawful or immoral actions reflecting upon him, it is difficult to comprehend why the State rejected a man of Konigsberg's background and character as morally unfit to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.359" offset="576763">Now, in California, there are two statutes which come in to play in connection with admissions of -- of perspective applicants for the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.226" offset="620231">We have the business and professions called Section 6060 which simply, along with age and education requirements, establishes that a person must be of good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.686" offset="674147">And then we have Section 6064.1 which says that no person who advocates overthrow of the Government by force and violence maybe a member of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.552" offset="725556">Now, as far as petitioner is concern, these are the only two statutes that are really involved in this case at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.557" offset="769651">Konigsberg comments the study of law in September of 1950 at the University of Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.098" offset="803715">He registered his intention to take the bar examination with the Committee of Bar Examiners in accordance with the normal procedures in December of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.745" offset="850317">His previous background was somewhat unusual for a law student in that he was already 39 years old had already had a distinguished career in social work in the community of Los Angeles and other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.449" offset="905174">He had a master's degree at Ohio State University.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.882" offset="918862">He had, at one time, been a supervisor in the Department of Health here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.063" offset="943626">He had been director of Social Services for the City of Hope Sanatorium in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.978" offset="963271">He had been a district director of relief in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.480" offset="981243">During the war, he had spent some four years in the army and had come out with the rank of captain in the United States Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.572" offset="1021680">Nevertheless, when the time came for him to take the bar examination, he was called in by the Committee Bar Examiners, which in California, under our integrated bar system, differing in that extent from Illinois, has the power to recommend to the Supreme Court but in California, the Supreme Court does the admitting of respective app -- applicants for the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.944" offset="1131186">He was called then and certain hearings were conducted of which the record was before this Court in its entirety in the case which was decided in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.051" offset="1183535">At the conclusion of the hearings in 1953 and 1954, the Supreme Court of California declined to review a determination by the Committee of Bar Examiners that the petitioner had not met his burden of proof that he was a person of good moral character or that he did not advocate overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.183" offset="1292100">The petition for review was made to the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.597" offset="1309759">And although three of the judges voted for a hearing, no hearing was held in the Supreme Court of California and the matter came to this Court on a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.225" offset="1356257">The decision of this Court, of course, is 353 U.S. 252, the case of Konigsberg versus State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.490" offset="1393351">Now, after the mandate from this Court came down to California, the petitioner, acting through counsel, requested the Supreme Court of California, which was not then in session, to set a time for hearing for the petitioner to be sworn in as a member of the Bar assuming that the -- that the opinion of this Court instructing the State of California to take action not inconsistent with the decision could only mean that petitioner should be admitted to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.919" offset="1523022">The considerable period of time passed in which the Supreme Court of California did not act and then finally, the Supreme Court vacated its previous orders in the matter and sent the matter to the Committee of Bar Examiners with instructions of the Committee of Bar Examiners should take action not inconsistent with the Supreme Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.788" offset="1618526">At that time, the petitioner then requested of the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State of California that the Committee of Bar Examiners simply make a recommendation that petitioner be admitted to the Bar of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.546" offset="1677563">Instead, the Committee of Bar Examiners called further hearings and the record, which is before this Court in the present proceeding, consists of the hearing before the Committee of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.128" offset="1735868">Now, when the hearing was held, petitioner again initially said, "There is no point to this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.685" offset="1770141">We have established the basic qualifications for admission to the Bar in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.775" offset="1790516">And we believe that the only action inconsistent with the Court decision is an order admitting -- certifying me to admission to the Bar."</text>
            <text syncTime="432.794" offset="1834506">The Committee turned down this motion and then asked petitioner whether he was prepared to answer other questions and petitioner indicated that he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.585" offset="1889677">The petitioner, at the subsequent hearing, introduced additional letters, some 14 or 15, now making a total of about 55 communications from persons in all walks of life in the Los Angeles community and elsewhere in the country, attesting to his good moral character and for the most part of testing to the fact that -- to the knowledge of the persons writing the letters that he did not advocate overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.593" offset="2009736">But at the first hearings and before this Court, in the briefs of the State Bar, there had been some comments to the fact that these letters really were not of great significance because they were in written form and there was no opportunity to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.779" offset="2074520">And so at this hearing, the petitioner added to the strength of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.206" offset="2092178">He offered the persons who had written the letters to be available for cross-examination but in addition to that, he brought his employer for the previous two and a half years as one live witness ready to testify before the Committee and submitting himself to the cross-examination of the Committee if they so wished as to petitioner's good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.576" offset="2185697">The witness testified and at the conclusion of the testimony, the Committee was asked whether they have any questions in cross-examination and they indicated they had none.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.495" offset="2233344">Now, what did the Committee do at this hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="535.776" offset="2246510">The Committee introduced not one single bit of evidence to contradict the good moral character already established to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.877" offset="2278902">They introduced no evidence of any kind regarding advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.523" offset="2293426">As a matter of fact, they introduced no evidence, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.444" offset="2313174">The Committee admitted that subsequent to the decision of this Court, the Committee had had an investigator who investigated into the background of the petitioner and stated specifically that if they had any information contrary to good moral character or indicating advocacy on the part of the petitioner, that they would bring this information forward and allow petitioner to rebut it before it would be used in any manner against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.728" offset="2434278">This is never been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.544" offset="2441592">It is safe to assume that the investigator found nothing wrong in the background or life of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.717" offset="2478268">In addition, the Committee failed to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.935" offset="2495091">And the only change, the only change in the record so far is the Committee is concern from that which was before this Court at the time of the prior decision was that the Committee asked again the same questions which it had asked in the record before this Court in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.993" offset="2575339">They again asked the petitioner whether he was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.225" offset="2592266">And this time, they changed the record only to the extent that they did give him a verbal, across the table warning in the sense that they said, "If you do not answer this question, it will prevent us from further investigating and therefore, it may make it impossible for us to certify you."</text>
            <text syncTime="645.436" offset="2685158">Now, other than that, there is not one single change in the record that was before this Court in the -- prior to the decision in 1957 and the record that is before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.983" offset="2743254">Now, petitioner pointed out at this hearing that the principal reasons which he had given before for not answering the question still prevail that as a matter of fact, he felt that he -- there was certain basis for a reinforcement of his principal position by reason of the Supreme Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.133" offset="2831862">And he took basically the position that one of the requirements upon him was that he be of good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.800" offset="2862582">If he had constantly, as he had, both before this Court and before the Committee, taken the position that it was a morally improper for him to respond to these questions, that the Committee was, in effect, placing him in the position where they said, "If you do not answer the questions, then we will not certify you.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.282" offset="2948472">But in effect, if you do answer the questions, you will buy your own definition be saying that you are an immoral person because for purposes of expediency, you are willing to answer the questions which your moral principles say you should not answer."</text>
            <text syncTime="726.920" offset="3011062">This was the dilemma that the Committee was placing him at.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.433" offset="3025063">And of course, he stood on the moral principles and declined to answer the specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.745" offset="3054320">Now, it's evident that so far as the evidence before this Committee is concerned, any change in the posture of the case is a change more favorable to Konigsberg because not only do we have the record of the favorable comments of the people in his community that we had before, we now have additional comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.879" offset="3142928">We have a live witness who testified and gave the opportunity for cross-examination and we have the concession on the part of the Committee of Bar Examiners that there are investigations into the background and life of Konigsberg had achieved nothing by way of information that would be detrimental to his good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.151" offset="3227982">So that if the record of this case in 1957 could not rationally show a basis for refusing to admit the petitioner, we would submit that such a conclusion is even less reasonable today.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.632" offset="3289945">And that simply based on this record and based on the decision of this case, we would submit the petitioner, based on the mandate of this Court, should have been admitted and this Court should make such an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.132" offset="3343862">But the Committee seemed to be of the belief that in the decision of this Court in 1957, there was some sort of an open door through which they could walk and find a means that this Court was -- was giving them a basis by which they could deny Konigsberg admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.425" offset="3433096">This was really the only conclusion that one can draw from the manner of procedure by which the Committee of Bar Examiners followed up the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.333" offset="3484714">I think then that we should examine this open door type argument and see whether there is any merit to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.363" offset="3520867">Now, obviously, counsel cannot very well endeavor to interpret what this Court did intend by the decision in 1957 other than by a reasonable and logical reading of the words of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.033" offset="3587532">And therefore, without presuming to try and read into the decision more than appears on the words, I will endeavor to see whether this door really was intended to be left open for the Committee of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.350" offset="3648763">First, I think, we must consider the elemental unfairness of the position taken by the Committee of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.476" offset="3681259">We must remember first of all, as I indicated the beginning, that there were two statutory bases in California under which petitioner might have been denied admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.795" offset="3730578">There's no argument that he meets all of the other requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.359" offset="3744789">There is no argument that he has passed the bar examination, that he is of proper age.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.494" offset="3761298">All of these requirements have been clearly met.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.939" offset="3775091">So that the only two statutory requirements that seemed to be in any way involved in this case are the statutory requirements of good moral character and the statutory requirement that he'd not advocate overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.817" offset="3830680">Now, the evidence relating to these factors was all in the record of this Court prior to the 1957 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.118" offset="3871848">And the Court found contrary to the position of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.283" offset="3888462">The Court specifically said that it could not see how the State of California could've refused admission to a person of Konigsberg's background and said in this opinion that the evidence did not support a finding that he was not of good moral character or that he was not a person who did not advocate overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.778" offset="3982503">Now, Mr. Justice Peters, in his dissent in the California Supreme Court on this second Konigsberg case, stated the theme, I think as clearly as it -- it can be stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.276" offset="4044466">Mr. Justice Peters said, "How many times does the issue of whether an applicant possesses a good moral character and as a loyal citizen have to be tried?</text>
            <text syncTime="995.059" offset="4083649">When does this litigation come to an end?</text>
            <text syncTime="997.830" offset="4094725">I had always though until I read the decision of the majority," referring to the majority to California court, in this case, "that our system of law was predicated on the fundamental theory that when issues between litigants have once been determined, they cannot be re-litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.908" offset="4158986">I had always thought that litigants were required to raise all relevant issues in one proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.300" offset="4184586">I had assumed the parties cannot litigate their case piecemeal."</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.424" offset="4201096">And Mr. Justice Peters concluded and we believe rightly, although the majority of the California court did not agree with him, that to permit respondent, the State in this case, to lose on one theory and approach to the case and then readjust the record to conform to some new theory, picking out a few words in the decision of the court on the very case is fundamentally unfair, it's arbitrary, it's capricious and it's a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.340" offset="4324707">And we submit that this is what the State of California has done in this, the Konigsberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.572" offset="4349680">But let's examine the language of the Court in this Konigsberg case and determine how it applies to the facts of the case as it now stand as the present posture of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.203" offset="4400149">What did the Court say that lead the State of California to this peculiar interpretation that they were not to then admit Konigsberg to the Bar?</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.992" offset="4439333">The language which they seem to up seized upon reads, "If and when a State makes failure to answer an independent -- makes failure to answer an independent ground for exclusion, then this Court, as the cases arise, will have to determine whether the exclusion is constitutionally permissible."</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.941" offset="4535150">Now, California somehow seems to have taken this statement as some sort of a mandate or a directive for them to take some action against Konigsberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.993" offset="4583320">And I submit that this is directly contrary to the clear import of these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.780" offset="4606516">California completely ignored the words preceding this in the decision which said, "There is nothing in the California statutes, the California decisions or even in the rules of the Bar Committee which suggest that this is a proper procedure for them to take."</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.033" offset="4683525">And the opinion then goes on to point out that establishing such a rule now without fair warning would raise questions with elemental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.058" offset="4719574">So California seizes upon this language of -- of fair warning and somehow comes to the conclusion that just sitting down across the table with the very man who has been involved in the lawsuit which has already been determined by the Court and that all they had to do is sit out across the table from him and give him a fair warning now 10 years after he started the practice of law and that this complied with the requirements of due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.591" offset="5073690">And I -- in -- in a moment, I -- I will meet directly to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.989" offset="5091349">Now, the State of California has, as I say, seized upon this warning point as the basis upon which they now feel that they have complied in some manner with this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.063" offset="5151640">But I think it's important, in determining the elemental fairness of what's taken place here, to examine the nature of the warning, the timing of the warming -- warning to see whether or not that warning did in fact comply with the requirements of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.042" offset="5219558">First of all, this warning took place simply by the Chairman of the Committee of Bar Examiners sitting in this session stating to the petitioner, "This is what we are saying to you that if you do not answer the question, this can be a basis for us refusing to certify."</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.878" offset="5298866">But we must remember that this took place seven years after this petitioner commenced the study of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.454" offset="5333138">We must remember that this was four years after he had completed his studies and had passed the bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.819" offset="5362604">And this was almost six months after this Court had ruled on the identical facts relating to the same identical person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.929" offset="5407117">Now, there was no statute in California before or after which related to this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.707" offset="5442226">There was no formal rule of the Committee of Bar Examiners passed in accordance with regulations which the Committee of Bar Examiners and the State of California had in effect self-imposed upon them because we have in California a provision which says that the Committee of Bar Examiners may pass a rule approved by the Board of Governors of the State Bar of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.028" offset="5551522">Now, if the Committee was endeavoring to say that this across the table type of warning was some sort of a new rule, they had failed to comply with their own statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.785" offset="5610559">If it was anything less than that, if it was not a rule of some stature, then what effect did it have upon the man who hears this for the first time so many years after he has entered into the study of law and has begun the entire sequence of events which have led him know or seven years later to this hearing having spent the time, the money to become a member of a profession of his own choice and suddenly by an across the table without any background, without any warning to be told, "If you don't answer this one question, this in and of itself will suddenly become a basis to deny your admission to the Bar"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.040" offset="5783489">Now, on top of that, there are several other factors that should certainly be considered in connection with what was the stature of this kind of warning that they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.300" offset="5828524">This Court decided a few weeks ago, the Nelson case which involved a -- also involved the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.350" offset="5868753">But in the Nelson case, there was a specific statute in California relating to the type of employee who is involved in the Nelson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.870" offset="5910862">But we have -- there is no statute and on the contrary, there have been several efforts, as I indicate in my briefs, to pass such statutes in California justifying the kind of question that was being asked here and in every situation, those statutes were defeated by the legislative bodies of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.269" offset="5992469">So that not only do we not have any legislative authority for the asking of the kind of -- of -- across the table question that we have here but we have the direct contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.536" offset="6041475">We have a determination by the legislature of California being asked to pass such a law and rejecting such law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.085" offset="6079718">So that we submit that under these circumstances, this kind of across the table type of warning is just not a warning, even assuming that this Court intended to leave this matter open for further action in the Konigsberg case as such that this was not the kind of warning intended by this Court and does not qualify in any manner as a proper warning to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.262" offset="6228407">I'm saying this, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that if there was any type of an instruction from this Court to the State of California, and I do not believe there was, I believe that, at most, this Court was saying that if, at some time in the future, another case arising where proper warning has been given so that the person who embarked upon the study of law knew when he started that if questions were going to be asked to him and he declined to answer them that he would be denied admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.891" offset="6366960">And I'm not saying that the Court indicated that this -- that grave constitutional questions would be raised even by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.979" offset="6395277">But I'm saying that if any hole was left in the decision, what was being said to the State of California was either have a statute or have a rule of some sort of some stature, so that the applicant can be properly warned that there is something of -- there is something in the books that will tell him when he commences the practice of law that this is a requirement of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.524" offset="6509484">Now, I say that in this case, this is not what happened at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.159" offset="6524008">There was no statute before the first decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.856" offset="6538846">There is no statute in the State of California today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.930" offset="6551071">There was no rule of the Bar Examiner's before the first decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.530" offset="6569462">There is no rule of the Committee of Bar Examiners today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.524" offset="6585448">And to go even further, the very rules governing the Committee of Bar Examiners in the State of California require that when they pass a rule that that rule must be approved by the Board of Bar Governors before it becomes a formal rule of the Committee of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.805" offset="6670608">So I say, what was the nature of this theme that happened at a hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.727" offset="6694327">It was not a -- it -- it was not a formal warning or a formal rule of any sort, it could be nothing more than a seven-year too late across the table comment from the Chairman of the Committee of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.073" offset="6755662">It could be nothing more than that because there was nothing of record that gained statutory authority for the asking of this particular question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.542" offset="6865586">I think that what I would say is that when one combines all of the circumstances behind this particular case and add up the fact that there was no rule in existence when he commence the Bar and there was not even a rule in existence when he came up to the point where he took the examination and there was not even a rule in existence when he was at the threshold of being admitted and that rule didn't exist at the time this Court made its decision and the rule still doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.867" offset="7006856">I am simply saying that when you add all of these factors together in this particular record, it seems to me that elemental unfairness is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.465" offset="7045204">Now, whether -- if the State of California or the Committee of Bar Examiners had intervened between the decision of this Court and the time they called him back and had passed some sort of a formal rule, in fairness, I would say that I think that I would be taking the same position that I am now because I think this would still be fundamentally unfair but they didn't even do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.824" offset="7190653">Now, when -- when the Committee of Bar Examiners talks in terms of a -- of some sort of an exclusionary rule, I would submit that on the basis of -- of the way the whole history of the way this has happened, they have fallen far short of giving due process to this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.223" offset="7324296">Now, when I say that, I certainly would not want to suggest, as I indicated to Mr. Justice Harlan, that I feel that had they come up with any such rule that I would not be making the same -- taking the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.784" offset="7382497">I think the rule even at that late date certainly has applied to this petitioner would have just been completely unfair and a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.376" offset="7424920">Now, the rationale by which the Committee perceives from the asking of the question in this across the table kind of questioning to a determination that they could not certify him for admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.820" offset="7530663">Is this theory that they developed that in some manner, they were frustrated in their inquiry and that by -- since they have the responsibility to determine fitness that they have been frustrated in the purposes of their inquiry and therefore, they could not certify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.453" offset="7609135">Now, I think examining this line of argument, we have to examine first what's being frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.654" offset="7665977">How are they being frustrated in this proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.014" offset="7679457">As I've indicated, under the California law, the only issues to be determined, as they apply to this case, at least of the moral character and the question of advocacy of force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.403" offset="7732955">Now, on both of these issues, this Court, in its opinion, made what amounted to a finding a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.520" offset="7761481">This Court said that the petitioner had met his burden of proof and it was inconceivable under these circumstances how the court in -- how California could have denied him admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.050" offset="7807561">So that we have the somewhat unusual situation applying to this particular case which perhaps would not apply to some other case of what amounted to a finding of fact on the two key issues which were before the Committee and then ultimately before the Supreme Court of -- of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.925" offset="7883107">Now, California has a code section similar to most States that once they -- condition once proved to exist is -- is presumed to continue until the contrary is proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.795" offset="7934516">The only change in the record, from the record before this Court in 1957, is a strengthening of the arguments in favor of a finding a good moral character, a further affirmation of bringing up-to-date of the good moral character of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.408" offset="8021034">The State of California now asks the self same questions which it had asked prior to the first decision of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.105" offset="8063770">It leaves the record in exactly the same condition that the record was in the exact same posture that it was in -- in 1957 and then somehow suggest that it has been frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.455" offset="8113194">But if we dig a little deeper into the -- into the record, I think that the -- the whole frustration argument becomes even more ludicrous based on the record before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.037" offset="8159483">First of all, this is not a situation of a petitioner coming before the Committee of Bar Examiners and simply without any basis at all saying I just -- I'm just not going to answer your questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.849" offset="8214758">This is a case of a petitioner who, for his own moral principles, has said there is an area in which I will not answer these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.361" offset="8252792">But he said, "Ask me any questions you want about wrongdoing of any kind, I will answer any of your questions."</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.440" offset="8285184">And they asked none and they presented none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.010" offset="8299395">He said the question of advocacy of force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.424" offset="8317053">He said at some points in the record that he was not satisfied as to even the constitutionality of that statute but he was not challenging that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.286" offset="8352475">And we have not before this Court challenge the constitutionality of this statute although we well might because the petitioner did answer any questions directed to advocacy of force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.647" offset="8402004">And he offered time and time and time again in this record, "Bring forth any facts, bring forth any evidence, I will answer any and all of your questions in this area."</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.322" offset="8448711">So here again, he is not frustrating the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.518" offset="8465429">He offered more than 50 character witnesses to be investigated, to be checked, to be brought before the Committee if they so wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.531" offset="8497507">They have the subpoena power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.719" offset="8502209">They could have called any one of these 50 witnesses if there was any question about the fact of his good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.778" offset="8530526">He brought his employer, two and a half years, who had every opportunity to know him, worked with him closely, testified that he gave him the right to sign checks on over a million dollars in his capacity as an employee and obviously, thereby indicated his faith and confidence in the character of this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.469" offset="8609207">Not a single question or cross-examination by the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.067" offset="8623626">And on top of that, the Committee had its investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.042" offset="8635538">Now, in the light of this record, one wonders about the legitimacy of this claim of frustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.461" offset="8685171">It would seem to me that what we have here is that the Committee is endeavoring to treat this case as though this were a young law student of 21 or 22 years of age appearing before the Committee for the first time being asked the first two or three questions and saying, "I won't answer them," and then completely frustrating any further inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.070" offset="8775659">But this just is not the case that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.110" offset="8787780">And I think that this is perhaps the basic fallacy in which the State has fallen into is in assuming that they are dealing with one case when in fact, they are obviously dealing with another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.558" offset="8841592">So that we submit that under these circumstances and when we weigh the need of the State for the kind of information which they were seeking here in balance with the otherwise complete, complete granting of all of the information which they seek, making available anything that they want, complete cooperation except in the most limited, narrow and to be sure, First Amendment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.047" offset="8971577">And when we balance this further with the need for the importance of freedom of the Bar, which I have indicated in some detail in my briefs and we'll not go into now because I'm sure that every member of this Court is as well aware of the importance of freedom of -- an independence of the Bar as anything that I could add at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.917" offset="9071052">When we weigh all of these factors in the balance, it certainly seems to me that we must -- the scales must drop very heavily on the side of Konigsberg.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.905" offset="10814986">It seems to me that first of all, these two cases were situations in which there had been prior, as distinguished from the question that Mr. Justice Harlan asked earlier, not the decision in the case itself but there had been prior determinations of the courts of the States of Pennsylvania and New York that failure to answer questions under a particular situation would be interpreted by the Court as incompetence or lack of candor and so forth and there would be -- and therefore, would be proper grounds for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.586" offset="10965765">In this case, the first judicial determination, if there has been any at all, would be the very decision in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.737" offset="11010278">But I think more important even in that distinction and the one which I must, with all sincerity urge upon the Court, is that there is a fundamental difference between an employer-employee relationship as exist even in the case of a teacher where the whole question of academic freedom must be considered, but there was a fundamental difference between the employer and employee, the asking of a question by an employer and the obligation of the employee to respond to that question and the asking of a question of an applicant for admission to the independent practice of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.912" offset="11179029">This is not an employer, employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.610" offset="11193762">The very essence of the relationship is the very contrary of employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.039" offset="11219571">The very essence of the relationship is the independence of the prospective lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.418" offset="11245066">No other profession has the responsibility that the legal profession has to maintain its independence from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.575" offset="11277667">It is the lawyer who must take the position of representing the State in its relationship with the individual and by the same token, it is the lawyer who must stand between the State and the protection of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.275" offset="11340466">And if we ever reach the point where we consider the relationship between the State and the lawyer, one of an employer-employee relationship, I submit that we will have lost some of the fundamental, the very fundamental nature of the independence in the profession of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.764" offset="12666441">Yes, sir, I was just coming to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.767" offset="12678457">With the exception that some three and one half years expired between the time when Mr. Konigsberg appeared before the Committee and made the record on which this case was here before and the time when he came before the Committee again and supplemented that record into the record which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.663" offset="12774066">At the time of the second hearing, Mr. Konigsberg again became a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.363" offset="12796844">Mr. Konigsberg introduced traditional letters as to his character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.801" offset="12818578">Mr. Konigsberg called and examined a witness who justified to what he deemed to be pertinent matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.285" offset="12852537">So the record to that extent is now different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.262" offset="12868420">Also, at the time of his second appearance before the Committee and the making of the record now before this Court, Mr. Konigsberg was warned in terms which cannot be mistaken or misconstrued that any failure to answer the relevant and pertinent questions of the Committee before whom he was then appearing would be deemed grounds by that Committee to deny his certification to the Supreme Court as having good moral character and he's not advocating the overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.282" offset="13008541">No question is raised here at this time as to the nature or the character of the warning which was given Mr. Konigsberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.795" offset="13046575">After having had an opportunity of some three and a half years to think over the refusals which he had made before to answer the questions which were asked him, he declined again to answer a single one of those questions which he had previously declined to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.306" offset="13124629">And again, testing what had transpired during this period of three and a half years, the Committee asked him, "Are you now a member of the Communist Party?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.748" offset="13166320">and he refused to answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.555" offset="13177605">They asked him as to each particular year from 1951 down to 1957 on this hearing was had which now makes this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.009" offset="13227447">And he refused to answer any of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.911" offset="13243016">So his position the second time was essentially the same as it was before with added denials to similar questions and with the reaffirmation of his refusal to answer the questions which he had refused before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.697" offset="13306128">Now, I think it maybe somewhat helpful to this Court to know the type of questions which this man has persistently refused to answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3333.811" offset="13438621">Now, the questions which Mr. Konigsberg did try to answer fall essentially into three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.869" offset="13466833">One of them, he declined to answer any question which was asked him with respect to his communistic membership, affiliations or associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.561" offset="13509569">I'm not going into those because they were quoted almost in full in the dissenting opinion in this case by Mr. Harlan when this case was here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.375" offset="13552828">I do, however, want to say this that I cannot accept the statement which Mr. Mosk paid here today to the effect that Mr. Konigsberg has answered with the upmost freedom any questions relating to his advocacy of the overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.960" offset="13627225">Mr. Konigsberg said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.491" offset="13637360">The Committee can only ask, “Do you now personally advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of this State by force or violence or other unconstitutional means?</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.848" offset="13682813">And if I say, no, yes or whatever it may be, that is as far as you can go.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.725" offset="13714265">That is without raising a question on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.467" offset="13729207">And again, he was asked whether he was contending that the Committee was bound by his answer yes or no which he gave and he said that he was that the Committee was not entitled to even cross-examine him upon that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.072" offset="13787617">Now, with the summary of event, these questions, which are in the other opinion before this Court, I passed to a second category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.536" offset="13821471">Mr. Konigsberg would not answer a question as to his association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.009" offset="13843414">And if I may be permitted, Mr. Justice Chief Justice, I want to read just a sentence out of an opinion of this Court and then read a sentence out of Mr. Konigsberg testimony in order that the two may just be laid side by side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.165" offset="13900048">In the Atler case, this Court said, "Once associate past and present as well as one's conduct may properly be considered in determining fitness and loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.623" offset="13945814">From time immemorial, one's reputation has been determined impart by the company he keeps.” That declaration has then affirmed by this Court on a good many occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.277" offset="13992521">Quoting now from Mr. Konigsberg, "I respectfully say that you are not entitled to know my associations and any person may refuse to answer on the basis of the rights of a citizen under the First Amendment which I have briefly referred you with my testimony."</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.697" offset="14066186">So he declined to be examined as to who his associates were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.740" offset="14086353">Now, in the opinion of this Court before, reference was made to a series of editorials which this man had written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.025" offset="14115506">And they were ragged group of editorials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.380" offset="14128880">He criticized everybody from the sheriff of Los Angeles County down to the President or up to the President of the United Sates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.154" offset="14160018">He criticized members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.880" offset="14170885">He said that we were an imperialist nation, that we were waging of war of regression in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.196" offset="14196172">He impugn the integrity of this Court, and as I say, just summing up on a whole labor of pretty ragged bunch of editorials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.281" offset="14232534">Now, let me make it clear as I did before, I don't question the man's right to write those editorials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.966" offset="14259284">But I do say that the character of those editorials made it imparity that the Committee before whom he was appearing at least asked him questions about -- about those editorials and that they deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.972" offset="14319261">They asked him, for example, with respect to the editorial which he wrote impugning the integrity of this Court, "Do you have any evidence on which to base that editorial?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.721" offset="14370252">And his reply was, "These writings of mine are protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.500" offset="14401390">You have no right to interrogate me with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.467" offset="14421243">The freedom of the press protects me in writings of that kind whether my utterances are true or false."</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.546" offset="14457605">Now, that's almost an exact quotation of the statement which Mr. Konigsberg made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.215" offset="14484250">And I submit to you that that's queer doctrine for a man seeking admission into the Bar of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.171" offset="14520090">So I pass from there and so much for the record which we are here upon before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.132" offset="14559901">The next question that rises is one, perhaps, involving the constitutionality of the questions which this Committee addressed to Mr. Konigsberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.716" offset="14598248">We are very akin in the basic concept to this case to the (Inaudible) case which was just argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.694" offset="14626147">We have certain matters in common with the Cohen case which will follow this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.077" offset="14647672">But I am going to dismiss the constitutional question very briefly for the reason that I submit that it has been answered by this Court in a number of decisions since we were here last on this case which now leaves no doubt as to the constitutionality and the propriety of the character of questions which were addressed to Mr. Konigsberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.816" offset="14742653">The Court sets we were here before has decided the Beilan case, the (Inaudible) case, the Nelson case, the Barenblatt case and a number of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.046" offset="14787584">And I think it may now be accepted without question as the rule of this Court that inquiry into the membership in Communist organization and allied questions of that kind and character are now permissible on constitutional grounds wherever fitness and loyalty are in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.738" offset="14878281">So I shall dismiss the constitutional question saying that we rely firmly upon those particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.638" offset="14909942">I do, however, want to supplement that concept by one further statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.111" offset="14931780">Our State Supreme Court has held that these questions which were addressed to Mr. Konigsberg were relevant and pertinent questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.626" offset="14969919">And I adopt the suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.369" offset="14976815">I advocate the suggestion which came from a member of this Court a few moments ago that that is purely a state question, not subject to review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.010" offset="15027388">Now, there are some contention made here that this Court closed the door upon us as to a further inquiry in to Mr. Konigsberg's situation before we admit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.818" offset="15070647">It maybe somewhat presumptuous on my part to stand here and tell this Court what it decided before, but I think I can accept certain declarations which appear in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.823" offset="15118712">In the first place, this Court before declined in specific words to pass upon the constitutional questions, perhaps it's here again and if so, I'm willing to submit it on the authorities which I have cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.227" offset="15176286">In its opinion before this Court declined to decide whether Mr. Konigsberg had a right to refuse to answer the questions which he refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.950" offset="15223202">In its opinion here before this Court held that when, as and if, that question was presented to the Court, that then you would undertake an answer to the problems which it -- which it then created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.534" offset="15285478">And with those declarations, the Court then remanded this case, not with directions to the Supreme Court of California to admit Mr. Konigsberg to the practice of law, but with directions to the State of California to take such other proceedings as it might be advised not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.298" offset="15376593">Mr. Konigsberg then became -- then came before the Supreme Court and moved that on the basis of the holding of this Court that there was -- that we had -- that California had previously impermissibly drawn inferences of not good moral character and not to adversity -- to overthrow of the Government, that upon the basis of those determinations that he'd be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.690" offset="15486098">That Court as it was then constituted by vote of 6-to-1 declined that suggestion and referred the case again to the Board of Bar Examiners for further proceedings not inconsistent with abuse which have been expressed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.391" offset="15556942">Mr. Konigsberg went before the Board of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.672" offset="15570108">He raised the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.869" offset="15578885">And that Committee, composed of distinguished lawyers of the California State Bar, refused his request in that respect unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.553" offset="15613576">They declined, not this time on the basis of any inferences wrongfully drawn or impermissibly drawn, but solely upon the basis of his refusal to answer questions which completely thwarted the investigation of this Committee into the two questions of his moral character and whether he advocated the overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.306" offset="15716603">Solely upon his refusal to answer those questions, the Board of Bar Governors declined to certify his -- him to the Supreme Court as being eligible for admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.181" offset="15764146">And that Court then, by a vote of 5-to-1 held that this -- that the prior decision by this Court did not estop them from now again considering Mr. Konigsberg position in the light of his refusal to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.125" offset="15843871">And by that vote or by two dissenting votes, Mr. Traynor's opinion, however, holding specifically that the Court had a right to again consider that question, they declined to admit Mr. Konigsberg to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.816" offset="15906670">Now, that's the record as it now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.387" offset="15916910">There is but one other point which has been raised here in the absence of some questions from this Court upon which I shall comment briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.308" offset="15952645">There has been some intimation here that California invented a new ruling for the purpose of excluding Mr. Konigsberg that this was something made expressly for him that is not born out by the record of our State at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.103" offset="16031744">There is a section of our brief devoted to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.950" offset="16047208">I shall not here repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.654" offset="16057971">There is no written rule, just as there was no written rule in the Beilan case, that if you don't answer, you will be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.611" offset="16097782">But in the case cited in our brief, our Supreme Court has held starting back over 30 years ago that the utmost candor and frankness is required on the part of any applicant for admission to the Court that they must answer pertinent inquiries from the Committee inquiring into their good moral character and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.170" offset="16180015">And on a number of occasions, five, I believe, in all the Supreme Court has declined to admit to practice law because of refusal to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.215" offset="16228185">And then at least two of those, certiorari was refused by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.776" offset="16250441">So I say on the basis of the cases which are set out in our brief that it has long been the rule in California that admission to practice law will be and can be and is denied to one who refuses to answer pertinent questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.372" offset="16320867">Unless there are some questions from this Court upon this record and that be now to -- that this case for your further consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.254" offset="16352423">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Mosk</label>
            <text syncTime="4068.056" offset="16375620">I shall also be quite brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.982" offset="16383352">I think that there are probably a very few matters that Mr. Belcher has raised that has not been covered fairly thoroughly in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.931" offset="16419088">There are a couple of matters on which the record, I think, should be made clear and that will be the word of my argument at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.866" offset="16446882">First of all, on the last point made by Mr. Belcher, a point that there are previous cases dealing with refusal to answer questions in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.360" offset="16484812">I submit the cases do not bare that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.144" offset="16495992">The cases cited by Mr. Belcher in the -- in his brief and to which we responded at least briefly in our closing brief are cases have been entirely different nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.448" offset="16537161">These were cases involving persons who have falsified their statements to the Committee of Bar Examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.194" offset="16564120">These are state -- these are cases in which persons were found after they had filed their applications to have been disbarred in some other State or who have committed some crime in some other State, not a single one of those cases deals with the situation where there has been a principal refusal to answer a question based upon high moral principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.526" offset="16649488">None of the cases are even related to the situation that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.359" offset="16664848">And I would submit that the citing of those cases as authority for the position by the State here is an indication of their lack of comprehension of the nature of the problem that we have before the Court that is a principal of declination based upon the entire First Amendment situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.093" offset="16739767">Now, I would point out only one other matter and that is the beginning of Mr. Belcher's argument in which he read quotations from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.149" offset="16799953">And I would point out to the Court that as far as I can tell, each of the quotations that are read to the Court at this time were read from the first hearings, were read from the record of this case prior to the time that this matter was already determined by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.846" offset="16862751">The type of statement and the nature of the declination which was read to you were the declination prior to the 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.337" offset="16900681">And I submit that we have set forth in detail the approach that Mr. Konigsberg took on the return and it is quite different, not in principle, but different in approach because most of us learn something about how to approach a Committee over a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.930" offset="16967137">And I think that if you will read the record, and as I'm sure all of you have, of the -- the more recent hearings, you'll find that there's an entirely different approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.395" offset="17008933">And particularly on page 13 -- 12 and 13 of petitioner's opening brief, you will find the quotations from Mr. Konigsberg in which he -- not only did he say that he would answer further questions relating to advocacy, but he begged the Committee to ask any questions relating to specific acts of wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.229" offset="17100257">He was no longer saying that you could not cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.494" offset="17113318">And I would concede that prior to 1957, perhaps, there was that element in the earlier record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.498" offset="17137351">I don't think it was intended in a manner that was indicated by Mr. Belcher's reading of it but there, perhaps, was that element.</text>

            <text syncTime="4307.930" offset="17335045">I would submit that on this record and the history of this case that that is the position that is a perfectly proper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.380" offset="17368900">He took the position and he said to the Committee, "The Supreme Court has already indicated by a previous decision that my position is certainly not a foolish position, that it is a principal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.778" offset="17434520">Now, you cannot ask me", he said to the Committee, "to change this principal position at this late day and in the light of the decision of this Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.023" offset="17471509">He said, however, "If you will ask me any questions about any kind of specific wrongdoing, any questions indicating that I have ever anywhere advocated the overthrow of the Government by force or violence or any other act of impropriety on my part, I will respond directly to that."</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.009" offset="17543398">And only in this limited area did he say that "I will not respond to the questions," but he did not foreclosed cross-examination at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.504" offset="17581432">It was just that the Committee had no facts upon which to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.248" offset="17596374">The Committee had no basis for proceeding further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.912" offset="17607032">They have no information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.225" offset="17612257">Their investigation had shown nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.504" offset="17621347">Therefore, the Committee did not proceed further with any type of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.912" offset="17639006">So that, if you will read the -- the record and particularly the statements on pages 11 through 13 of our brief, I think you will find that there has been no cutting off of questioning as would seem to have been indicated by Mr. Belcher's statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="4432.289" offset="17832521">Mr. Justice Stewart, our -- our position is -- is simply this that just as the first time that this case was before the Court, the Supreme Court of California had by refusing to refute the decision of the -- of the Committee of Bar Examiners and thereby barred to Konigsberg from admission to the Bar had, in effect, made a declaration of the position of the State of California on that matter and in effect, had approved the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.115" offset="17939832">Now, when this matter goes back a second time, we have a -- a decision of the Supreme of California which states a reason and it gives the language of a state -- a state ground.</text>
