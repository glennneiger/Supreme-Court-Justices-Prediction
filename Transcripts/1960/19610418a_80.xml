            <label>Mr. Byron M. Gray</label>
            <text syncTime="21.976" offset="191300">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.520" offset="205406">There are two petitions consolidated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.345" offset="220766">I will make the direct argument for Pan American, and Mr. Paul Schlicher will make the direct argument for Texaco, and I will make the rebuttal for both petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.494" offset="285341">These appeals involve the rate paid on sales of natural gas made subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.055" offset="331630">The actions originated in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.254" offset="348348">Now, the Natural Gas Act, as Your Honors know is a complete regulatory act and particularly, is applied to these actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.743" offset="394324">Section 4 of the Act provides for a complete rate filing with the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.622" offset="441866">It provides that all rates and charges must beyond the file of that Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.655" offset="457958">Section 19 provides a very complete review, procedure and everything, and the review jurisdiction is placed in the various United States Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.296" offset="524518">Section 22 provides for the enforcement of the rights and duties and obligations created by that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.483" offset="557328">So, the question here is whether or not a state court has jurisdictions of an action involving natural gas rates required by the Act to be on file with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.733" offset="618350">The facts of the -- these actions have to go back beyond January 1, 1954 because the contracts that are involved were entered before that date and for -- for less than eleven-cents per thousand cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.690" offset="698180">But on January 1, 1954, the so-called Kansas eleven-cent minimum rate order was entered by the Kansas Corporation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.357" offset="748753">It became effective on that date and required that eleven-cents, in order to meet the conservation requirements of the Kansas statute to prevent waste of gas, that eleven-cents would be the minimum rate that could be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.470" offset="821269">Now, the Cities Service, the respondent here, advised these petitioners that it would comply with the Kansas order and pay the eleven-cents, but it was doing so under the compulsion of the order and would expect its -- its money refunded back to the contract rates in the event the Kansas order were ultimately declared to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.632" offset="941850">And for five or six months that was the status.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.954" offset="967137">And then on the sixth day and the seventh day of June 1954, this Court decided Phillips versus Wisconsin, wherein for the first time, the industry and these parties came aware of the fact that producers of gas that the wellhead independent producers were natural gas companies within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.746" offset="1062327">And therefore, of course, it required to file their rates and take all of the other actions that the Act requires of natural gas companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.375" offset="1100884">The Federal Power Commission responded to the Wisconsin case by implementing Section 4 of the Act setting forth the requirements for filing and required that the parties file the rate, in effect, on June 7, 1954 as their initial rate filing under Section 4 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="280.492" offset="1225331">Now, Section 4 (c) of the Act requires that schedules showing all rates and charges be filed and will file with the Federal Power Commission that I stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.447" offset="1285204">Responding the order of 74 -- 174 and in conformities to that order and the requirement of that order that the rate, in effect, on June 7, 1954 be filed as initial rate of filing under Section 4 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="316.175" offset="1368064">These petitioners filed what the Commission's order required them to file, the contract, any documents supplementary of the contract and one of this is the Kansas eleven-cent order.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.377" offset="1432848">And the Order 174 also required that they file a billing statement showing the billing as it was being made on June 7, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.072" offset="1471613">These parties filed the billing showing the eleven-cent rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.996" offset="1507349">Thereafter, now, I should say that no objection was made to this rate tender, although the cities, people were served at that time with copies of the tender as made and were perfectly aware of the fact that it was eleven-cent tender and in fact will paying the eleven-cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.576" offset="1597628">Since then, and as I will point out, subsequently, continued to pay it after the Commission had accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.496" offset="1629393">After these filing, the Federal Power Commission admits and its record show that it considered the rate tender of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.355" offset="1688743">I should say that Pan American did not file this refund letter, but they considered the rate filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.411" offset="1721031">This document file construed it to be a rate filing of eleven-cents, set forth in their records that they voted to accept it, and the records show, on page 639 of this record, the schedule as they set out, and it says at the top summary of independent producer rate filing and these contracts over it decide price June 7, 1954 eleven-cents, eleven-cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.521" offset="1865435">Thereafter, immediately following that, the Commission notified the -- then the Standard Oil &amp; Gas Company, now the Pan American, "This is to advise you that the rate filings listed at the bottom of this letter have been accepted for filing."</text>
            <text syncTime="466.035" offset="1967522">Now, there you have a complete compliance with the Act itself, the filing of the tender of the rate, its acceptance, and you had no actions at all by cities, no actions under Section 19 of the Act to seek any review of what the Commission had done, instead of that, they continued to pay the eleven-cents and did so for more than three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.231" offset="2136273">And as I shall point out later, it must essentially also require what the Commission here did, a consideration of the rate filing and its acceptance in filing with the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.617" offset="2409827">And there was no objection on the part of Cites at -- whatsoever with the filing that Pan American made, although they were served with copies of it, of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.472" offset="2453295">And furthermore, Your Honor, as I point out whatever was the compulsion of the eleven-cent payment during the few months prior to the filing, it may have been under the compulsion of the Kansas eleven-cent order for those four or five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.966" offset="2515257">But subsequently, it was under the compulsion of the fact was the rate on file, in the files of the Federal Power Commission, and that month begin the compulsion thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.557" offset="2557576">And they continued to pay eleven-cents for three years and more, as I shall point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.758" offset="2578369">But my point at this point is this, when the Commission accepted and placed eleven-cents in its files as the filed rate, that withhold jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission and the Natural Gas Act attached to that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.687" offset="2654124">And all of the requirements of the Act (Inaudible) and every right and liability, it really wasn't developed by the Act from the moment of Federal Power Commission took that eleven-cents and said, “This is the rate in effect on June 7, 1954.”</text>
            <text syncTime="657.026" offset="2731447">And if anyone wanted to do anything about it, the Act provided the remedy in Section 19 of judicial review not in the state court, not even in the Federal District Court but in a Circuit Court of Appeals, and they took no such action, and that's my point there.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.467" offset="3329233">Now, you have those cases arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.898" offset="3338951">And I don't want to get too far into this, but here's -- if you will remember quite recently in 1960, you have before you the case of Texas Gas Transmission Company versus Shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.812" offset="3434663">And I think you have to go back to the Circuit Court, but that was a Section 19 (b) case, and it involves this very order, 174 that required initial filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.433" offset="3489102">But there -- there was an escalation or what you call a "favored-nation" clause, and the question was whether it's been triggered or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.603" offset="3541765">And that Shell or the producer had offered for filing a rate higher than the contract seemed to call for because it was contended that the escalation clause had been triggered by some other contract, and I'm sure you remember that case, by some of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.397" offset="3632985">Well, the Commission didn't just accept what they offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.952" offset="3663182">They exercised their jurisdiction to determine whether or not to accept what was offered, and they didn't accept it because it didn't appear on the face of things, how the rate got to be twelve point something cents instead of nine point something cents.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.107" offset="3779793">And it was bridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.264" offset="3784391">It was bridged by the tender, of what or anything, anyone then knew was a perfectly valid Kansas eleven-cent order.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.748" offset="3830366">Now, I'm coming to the invalidation of that order some three years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.410" offset="3853040">But as far as the Commission goes, at that time, if it had jurisdiction to accept any rate whatsoever, eleven-cents or any other rate, if it had jurisdiction, it exercises it.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.324" offset="3920645">And anyone who didn't like what it did was certainly called upon the Act then or Section 19 doesn't mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.149" offset="3951992">Now, that's my point there.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.987" offset="3959306">It may -- I've been wrong, but it was honestly wrong if it was wrong and, of course, mistakes in law, as you heard here in criminal law even sometimes work hardships.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.779" offset="4002461">But if it one mistake on anybody part, it was an honest mistake, but the record and the history of the Magnolia case shows that Cities knew very well what to do because there, it did the very thing and it might have done here, contested the rate tender when it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.086" offset="4087724">But it didn't do it here, and I say that the eleven-cent acceptance filing became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.950" offset="4123146">But in all events, on January 20, 1958, this Court held, in effect, that the Natural Gas Act so far preempted the field of rates as it applies to producers that the wellhead producing gas for resale and the interstate commerce as to preempt the State and take away any power that the State might have had and declare the Kansas eleven-cent order in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.996" offset="4275388">Now, Cities will claim that it's been held to be invalid to have an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.878" offset="4290853">Well, I don't want to get in to that argument, but I don't think it makes any real difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.350" offset="4308720">But at all the events, it was declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.849" offset="4322722">Now, for three years, these parties had been paying eleven-cents not by a virtue of the Kansas order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.235" offset="4348322">They've been paying by virtue of the fact that it was the rate on -- filed under the 4 (c) of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.831" offset="4446647">I think you have to consider this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.266" offset="4456469">It may have been so conditioned, and Mr. Schlicher will discuss this more than I will, but it may have been so conditioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.387" offset="4484890">But, the -- the record shows clearly what the Commission's action was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.129" offset="4503907">It considered the rate to be eleven-cents, and that's the rate, the records of the Commission show that it accepted and filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.457" offset="4537240">So I can't think that -- that that letter being filed or not being filed made any overwhelming difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.628" offset="4569840">It might have influenced the Commission to accept the matter down for hearing on its motion, and I've heard the parties argue about it but it didn't -- so far as I know, do that, although I hate to discuss Mr. Schlicher's particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.155" offset="4635982">But that's -- that would be my view of it, that the important thing is they exercise their jurisdiction to file a rate, and they filed eleven-cent rate, they did it in both cases, and I think that ends the matter in my certain appeal under Section 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.659" offset="4702020">But in any event, after the Kansas order was declared invalid, Cities brought these actions in the trial court in Delaware State Court, and they brought them upon these refund -- so called -- what they called refund letters or involuntary payment letters that you might choose to call them, the common-law action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.583" offset="4809749">In their first petition, they didn't say anything at all about the gas being sold for resale in interstate commerce which is a rather considerable jurisdictional fact that they're ommiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.935" offset="4855097">Well, after some parrying around and filing various motions one thing and another, the fact began to emerge that -- that this gas was sold for resale in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.478" offset="4905253">But for whatever reason, Cities then amended their complaint and it seems to me this just demolishes their argument that they will properly, in the State Court general jurisdiction with the common-law action, because I almost have to raise this amendment that they put in because its jurisdictional and supplies the jurisdictional fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.066" offset="5011623">They said in their amendment, “Plaintiff owns and operates an interstate gas pipeline system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.575" offset="5037641">During all times, material, herein, plaintiff has been and is now engaged generally in the business of purchasing natural gas for transportation and sale in interstate commerce for resale,” that's almost the words of the statute, "for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial or any other use and furtherance, whereof, the contract referred to in paragraph 3 about what's entered into."</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.694" offset="5158118">Well, promptly after that, of course, there was a motion on the part of defendants for summary judgment on the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.355" offset="5196779">I -- I don't want to go now too much into the ruling of the trial court because it doesn't make too much difference here, but it reasoned in -- in effect that it could wiped out the Kansas eleven-cent order automatically and retroactively and -- and reach back and do for the Federal Power Commission what the Federal Power Commission didn't do for itself, and then come out with the rate that it thought the Federal Power Commission could come out, and it ultimately reached a rather odd conclusion that there was no inconsistency in exercising state court jurisdiction as a -- of a common-law claim as long as the rate involved would be the same whether it was a filed rate or the rate under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.448" offset="5389145">Now, that makes appeal this Court, but it just doesn't appeal to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.453" offset="5413177">But that was in about the reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.748" offset="5426343">The -- strangely enough, after it was apparent, the trial court was going right ahead and entered judgments in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.763" offset="5470438">Of course, the party didn't want these large judgments entered against them one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.280" offset="5488515">And they proceeded these petitioners to the Supreme Court of Delaware to get a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial court proceeding to exercise the jurisdiction in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.228" offset="5540237">The Supreme Court of Delaware, well, I didn't use the same words as the trial court got to the same end and in very much the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.655" offset="5601991">They said and I'm -- I'll quote very little from it, but it will give you the general rationale of how the Supreme Court looked at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.064" offset="5635636">They said both parties agreed that as to the period after July 16, 1954, the only legal rate is the filed rate, not even a court can authorize commerce, and they come out other terms reporting the Montana-Dakota case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.003" offset="5703346">The question then becomes, what rate was legally filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.609" offset="5737827">Then they say, “However, since the Kansas order was void, the only lawful filed rate is the contract rate unaffected by the Kansas order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.477" offset="5785266">So, no, that was the -- that was the trial court, that was the trial court that said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.659" offset="5814000">The Supreme Court of Delaware held as long as the exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court would not be inconsistent with the filed rate with the Natural Gas Act but it was alright for them to go ahead and exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.359" offset="5912848">And they, in effect, held that the action of the FPC, in accepting the eleven-cent tender was a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.693" offset="5962167">They said, “Defendants duly filed the documents required,” that was required by -- by 174, the order of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.613" offset="6005844">These documents included copies of the contract with Cities, copies of the Kansas price order and statement showing that the price to Cities on June 7, 1954 was eleven-cents at this specified pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.790" offset="6062582">The Commission duly convened and voted to accept them for filing, now this is Supreme Court of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.314" offset="6096645">Then they say, “Being void, the unilateral filing of the order is part of the rates schedule was a nullity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.547" offset="6125589">They held that "informed at least" they said and that's the words of the Supreme Court of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.157" offset="6143979">Informed at least the action is based upon the refund contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.338" offset="6164773">Now, despite of the fact that they have said that the Commission met and voted and accepted for filing a eleven-cent rate despite of the fact that they recite all of these matters that are jurisdictional to the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.371" offset="6236871">They hold that the Natural Gas Act did not prevent the state court from exercising jurisdiction in this action on this refund contract (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.081" offset="6303744">Now, without to be nothing more or less than a collateral tax upon the action of the Commission and upon that eleven-cent rate, it either must be an attempt to gain a review as you would do under Section 19 of the Act or it must be treated as an action to enforce to file rate which would be a Section 22 action or perhaps both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.844" offset="6414712">Perhaps, they try to do in the state court what they would have to have gone to the Circuit Court of Appeals and review actions to do and then having established what the file rate is, if -- when pay it they go into a Federal District Court because Section 22 of the Act says that exclusive jurisdiction of actions to enforce any right, to enforce any right created by the Act or liability shall be in the federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.204" offset="6564237">Now, the subject matter of these actions whether it's in the state court or whether it's in the federal court or wherever it is, the subject matter and obviously, the price to be paid for this gas that was sold subject to jurisdiction under the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.205" offset="6636231">That's got to be the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.798" offset="6646575">And they're simply cannot be concurrent causes of action, one, based on the contract and one, based on the filed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.394" offset="6692968">Now, in the Montana-Dakota case involving the power electric -- power statute that are identical to these statutes, this Court said that the rate at its own file in the Federal Power Commission is the rate that's almost pay -- it -- is the only rate, anyone can pay, and that is true whether it has been fixed or merely accepted for filing by the Federal Power Commission, and that must be the controlling law if there is to be any sense at all to our regulatory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.511" offset="6833403">What -- through the Delaware court and what the -- through -- both Delaware courts on and it's in fact, I think, throwing off certain of our trial -- federal courts have decisions in such cases as the Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.208" offset="6916159">Now, Mobile went up under the review statutes, and that's something you all overlooked, as all of these cases that the Cities cite went up under Section 19 as review statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.414" offset="6965060">And in Mobile, this Court said that the Act left the parties free to contract as to their rates, but it didn't say and make them effective outside the scope of the Federal Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.801" offset="7018559">Now, I didn't say that, and I can tell you why it seems to me they couldn't have said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.286" offset="7044472">What this Court have said that the intent of Congress was to take away, preempt Kansas State's rights to deal with these rates and turn them over to private parties entirely without any standards to make them effective contract, for them effective suing court on them entirely outside the scope of the Federal Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.697" offset="7134124">That raises constitutional questions, I don't want to discuss here, and I'm not going to discuss, because you can see them as clearly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.870" offset="7162859">But, that is what you would have to say to hold with Cities, is that these parties can enter into a -- contracts, make it effective without filing, sue on it in the state court, wholly outside of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.655" offset="9897984">The letter order of acceptance of the Commission is shown at page 155 of the record, and that letter orders says that "Any provisions contained in this document which provide for automatic adjustments and charges may not operate to change the rates being charge June 7th, 1954," which was certainly the eleven-cent rate, no one denies that, "until a change in rate has been filed pursuant to Section 4 (d)," and that is exactly what the Mobile case says cannot be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.480" offset="11433253">The petitioners here have spent a large part of their argument as they have in their oral argument in their briefs in discussing matters which go to the judgment which should be rendered in the trial court when these cases are tried on their merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.430" offset="11517053">Now, those matters will not aid in determining whether or not the Superior Court of New Castle County has jurisdiction to try these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.450" offset="11565223">When petitioners argue the merits of their filed rate defenses, they are confusing the jurisdictional question with the wholly unrelated matter as to what the judgment should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.235" offset="11624364">This Court may discuss this confusion in Montana-Dakota, which I cite because it had been cited by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.614" offset="11677863">There, this Court explained that if the plaintiffs complaint states the cause of action which invokes the jurisdiction of the trial court, then the mere statement of that claim invokes that jurisdiction to determine whether the claim is meritorious or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.706" offset="11754245">Thus, the single question here in this appeal from an order denying a writ of provision is whether or not the state court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.012" offset="11807431">This, I think, requires a careful examination of the cases as they pin below because it is our feet that this is the critical test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.645" offset="11861974">The fatal weakness of petitioners' position is their refusal to deal with the cases as they are.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.796" offset="11950582">These cases were brought to enforce common-law rights, and liabilities which came into being when this Court held at the Kansas minimum price order was void.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.708" offset="12042219">The complaints filed against each of the petitioners is substantially identical, restated in narrative form, they tell they relate these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.104" offset="12083806">Cities Service Gas Company is a natural gas company engaged in this business as an interstate gas pipeline company, the petitioners or producers of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.493" offset="12133334">In 1949 and in 1950, Cities entered in long term contracts for the purchase of gas produced in the Kansas Hugoton Field from these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.530" offset="12177533">Those contracts fixed prices for the purchase of the gas had approximately eight cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.167" offset="12208044">After those contracts had been being performed for four and five years, respectively, the Kansas Corporation Commission on December 2nd, 1953 entered its minimum price order purporting to fix a minimum price of eleven-cents per Mcf for all gas produced in the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.924" offset="12303026">Upon the entry of that order, Cities commenced an action to review it challenging it as being invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.470" offset="12341269">After that action had been commenced but before Cities made its first payment in compliance with the order, Cities wrote a letter to each of the petitioners, the January 21 letter to which Mr. Gray referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.458" offset="12401246">In that letter, Cities explained that it had commenced an action for the judicial review of the validity of that order, and that while that litigation was pending, it would pay the eleven-cent price in compliance with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.422" offset="12461014">But that those payments were to be made by Cities and to be accepted by the producers as the involuntary compliance with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.476" offset="12501243">And the January 21 letter conclude, “In the event the order is finally judicially modified or declared to be invalid in whole or in part, Cities Service Gas Company will expect you to refund to it the amount of any over payments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.493" offset="12573341">Immediately upon receipt of that letter, the petitioner Pan American answered in which it restated the terms of the letter generally as we had stated it and concluded saying, “We will therefore accept the payments on this basis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.542" offset="12649514">Thereafter, for 47 months, Cities made payments monthly for all gas purchase from each of the petitioners by monthly check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.965" offset="12699251">And on each of those checks, there was subscribed an endorsement in which it was said these payments are made subject to the terms and the conditions of the January 21, 1954 letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.456" offset="12753168">I think that is significant especially in view of Mr. Gray's suggestion that the payments were pursuant to a Federal Power Commission filed rate schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.921" offset="12799039">In other words, those payments by those checks with that endorsement on them used continuously from the first payment after January 1954 until this Court's decision on January 20, 1958 holding that the Kansas price order was void.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.709" offset="14182170">I think they preserve the right to continue to claim that they get the eleven-cents under the Kansas minimum price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.936" offset="14235146">This brings us -- of course, having explained how the payments were made to the decision of this Court rendered on January 20, 1958 in which this Court held that the Kansas order was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.714" offset="14282271">And also brings us past to the point that we, thereupon, seize making payments at the eleven-cent price and made a demand upon each petitioner for a refund of the difference between the amounts of money which we had paid them under the void order and the amounts which we're dealing under the contract price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.683" offset="14358131">Upon their refusal to make those demanded refunds, we commenced these actions in the Delaware State Court, making allegations which related in more formal terms exacts the exact statement of facts, as I have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.143" offset="14419989">The concluding paragraph in each complaint set forth Cities three alternative common-law theories of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.670" offset="14462098">We claim that there was a contract to refund made by the January 21, 1954 letter and the acceptance of payments made subject to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.991" offset="14499297">And then, of course, in the case of Pan American, who had answered our letter, we included the claim that that answer we will, therefore, agree to accept payments on this basis made a written contract to refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.951" offset="14547153">The second theory of our recovery was the theory -- the common-law doctrine of restitution for -- of moneys which had been paid under a judgment or an order which is later reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.469" offset="14601279">And the third was the common-law doctrine of unadjusted ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.286" offset="14620505">Now, those are the complaints as they were alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.748" offset="14638373">The petitioners' answers, as I previously suggested, included some 19 separately stated defenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3678.149" offset="14816005">Of course, we had a great deal of help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.607" offset="14821752">The Fifth Circuit had recently decided Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America versus Harrington which involved refund to payments under the Oklahoma order, and we had a pretty good guide as to the cause of action which could be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.584" offset="14881729">We follow that as precisely as it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.511" offset="14897403">As has been suggested, the Natural Gas Act got into this case wholly by way of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.358" offset="14920808">Texaco pleaded it and their fifth separate defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.092" offset="14939721">There, they alleged that they had an eleven-cent filed rate because of the effect of the Kansas minimum price order and of their filing of a copy of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.837" offset="14982771">And Pan American as its third separate defense, claim that the Cities' recovery was barred because they had a filed rate of eleven-cents on -- because they had filed a copy of the minimum price order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.294" offset="15044524">I think that it would be well to mention the amendment because as I understand that is the single claim which the petitioners make here that that changed it all the effect of our common-law causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.699" offset="15106173">Of course, it is perfect obviously from an examination of the amendment in which we allege that this was interstate gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.957" offset="15139192">We were simply coming within the terms of this Court's judgment holding that the Kansas minimum price order was void as to such things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.334" offset="15180675">There is the suggestion in the briefs, it has not been mentioned or laid back in some way Cities' answer briefs in response to petitioners' briefs in support of motions for summary judgment in some way changed our common-law causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.071" offset="15259669">I think a brief examination of those briefs and the setting in which they were filed will dispel any feeling with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.664" offset="15301987">You understand that the petitioners' filed motions for summary judgment which were not directed at the jurisdictional issue at all, but simply claim that there filed rates were good defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.664" offset="15362069">We responded, they then filed a brief in support of those motions for summary judgment relying upon the doctrine of Montana-Dakota that there could be deviation for -- from the filed rate, and that therefore, the filed rate was going to be a meritorious defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.585" offset="15425703">We responded, of course, by recognizing this Court's decision in Montana-Dakota but pointing out that our common-law causes of action, which we had asserted, were perfectly consistent with and perfectly compatible with the petitioners' filed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.361" offset="15492786">Now, this, I think, fully describes the cases as they now end in the Delaware Superior Court and to which the petitioners would have this Court apply the provisions of Section 22 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
