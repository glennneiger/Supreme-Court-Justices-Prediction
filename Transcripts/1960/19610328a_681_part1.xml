            <text syncTime="10.019" offset="143444">Mr. Mahoney.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_g_mahoney" startTime="13.460" stopTime="434.978">
            <label>Mr. William G. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="13.460" offset="157236">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.803" offset="170611">This case comes before Your Honors on an appeal of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees and the Railway Labor Executives' Association from a judgment and order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, dismissing a complaint which those two organizations had brought in that court, for the following reasons which is expressed at page 12 of our brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.774" offset="266428">The railroad labor force is now confronted with the threat through the use of Section 5 (2) (f) for the utilization of -- for merger to that statute which Congress thought would materialize 20 years ago, when it enacted that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.475" offset="341243">The time has now come therefore, for the employees to be afforded the protection intended by Congress to take effect when this threat arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.744" offset="382307">The complaint request to the Court to set aside, at least in part, an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission issued under the provisions of Section 5 (2), approving the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad merger, because that order does not observe the specific requirement contained in subparagraph (f) of Section 5 (2), which it must contain and, that is that there be terms and conditions imposed which provide that for varying periods of up to four years from the date of the approval of the merger that the transaction will not result in employees of a carrier or carriers by railroad affected by such order, being placed in a worse position with respect to their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.141" offset="567986">The Commission's order does contain certain conditions relative to employees who are affected, but these conditions not only fail to protect an employee from being placed in a -- placed in a worsened employment situation, but require such effects to occur before the conditions become operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.967" offset="643218">These conditions are known as the New Orleans conditions and provide a constituted formula of compensatory protection for those who were deprived of employment, displaced, have to move and so forth, as a result of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.884" offset="698911">But these effects have to occur before these conditions become operative and it is our position that that type of protection does not meet the mandate of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.870" offset="738826">The issue, the narrow issue before the Court, is whether the phrase, “worse position with respect to employment” really is intended to protect the employment of the man or only certain elements of that employment and not the employment itself, in other words, whether he's to be given money in lieu of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.895" offset="818970">It is our position that this phrase means that in this merger cases, the employees must be given -- provided continuing employment in a comparable job, at a comparable wage and if the wage is less than that which he previously earned, then it must be made up by what is called in the railroad industry, a displacement allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.424" offset="921057">And there is nothing astonishing or new or unprecedented about Congress protecting employment, providing employment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.577" offset="949687">It did so in 1933 in the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.186" offset="972152">It did so in 1943, in the Communications Act of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.910" offset="986990">And it is no answer to say that these measures of 1933 and 1943 were emergency measures, very limited in their application and therefore, cannot be compared with Section 5 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="235.017" offset="1043414">Because in 1933, or excuse me, in 1943, the communications industry was in no worse financial situation than the railroad industry was in 1933, when the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.918" offset="1103078">The 1943 Act was passed to save the communications -- industry by permitting merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.427" offset="1125125">And there were only two -- virtually only two companies to which that statute applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.526" offset="1153442">It was the -- Postal Telegraph and Western Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.830" offset="1166712">They comprised just about the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.661" offset="1186043">But now, we have a situation which is applicable to practically the entire industry also.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.584" offset="1213733">Almost all the railroads of the United States are attempting to merge and this is precisely what Congress had in mind, as we hope to show in passing this statute and further, this is not an unlimited protection which these men are given.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.239" offset="1260335">It is limited in time to four years, as Congress isn't required to go beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.195" offset="1288129">Now, excuse me, the Commission is not required to go beyond four years in applying this protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.349" offset="1308818">And it cannot be said, we submit that this protection would harm the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.253" offset="1336404">For they say in their evidence that only 862 men would be deprived of employment as a result of this merger and these 862 men would be deprived of employment only because they would refuse to transfer to available jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.658" offset="1402023">And under this type of protection, it is our position that they would have to transfer to those available jobs or receive no protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.530" offset="1437445">The appellants do not contend and have never contended that the protection required by the second sentence of Section 5 (2) (f) is an absolute, strict, inflexible job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.495" offset="1497318">The Government described the appellants' position at page 19 of its brief in this language, “The essence of appellants' position is that no employee of a consolidated railroad system should be adversely affected in any respects for a period of four years or less time if his previous employment is less from the effective date of the Commission's order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="368.939" offset="1579133">And at page 17 of the brief, the Government states, “Appellants claim that the general language in which the second section of the sentence is couched has a single, specific, inflexible meaning that an absolute job freeze must be imposed in every case in which the Commission approves a merger.”</text>
            <text syncTime="386.434" offset="1649142">Now, the appellants have never contended that the term, “no worse position with respect to employment” meant such an absolute, strict, job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.069" offset="1683623">We have never can explain than employees could not be adversely affected in any respect under this type of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.818" offset="1714657">For example, a man whose job is transferred is adversely affected if he has to pick up his family and move.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.655" offset="1742033">That's adverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.667" offset="1746004">That's real adverse effect, but he might not be placed in a worse position with respect to his employment as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.385" offset="1776933">It's conceivable, in some instances, it might be better employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.066" offset="1795636">He might be promoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.180" offset="1800129">Also a man must take -- who must take another job, a different job, may be adversely affected, but that doesn't mean necessarily, he's placed in a worse position with respect to his employment.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="434.978" offset="1843284">I don't understand your position on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.848" offset="1850807">I wish you'd explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.690" offset="1858121">I had assumed that the difference between you and the Government was that, although under the plan, a laid off employee got all of his compensation, all of his salary, all of his moving expenses, all of his rights in every other respect that your view was that it still did not satisfy the terms of the Act and that the Government's characterization which you disclaim now is fair characterization of your position that the man had to continue in the position in which he was employed.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_g_mahoney" startTime="478.200" stopTime="642.390">
            <label>Mr. William G. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="478.200" offset="2016214">It is our position, Your Honor, first of all that these conditions do not protect the employee in all aspects of his employment relationship except employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.225" offset="2060309">That is the conditions that were imposed by the Commission do not protect a man in every aspect of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.864" offset="2086849">To the contrary, it causes great harm and it doesn't even provide complete financial protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.424" offset="2113076">He doesn't get paid for all the fringe benefits for instance that he loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.609" offset="2125824">He doesn't get paid, if he is required to move more than once as a result of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.031" offset="2147453">The -- he starts a chain of bumping to seniority, exercising seniority rights which affects many more than just the man who was affected on -- in the particular job which is abolished or transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.557" offset="2197608">Now, all of these things happen and as a result of that adverse affect, he is placed in a worse position with respect to his employment and we feel that the minimum that is required by that phrase, that term is that he be continued in employment in a comparable job at a comparable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.261" offset="2300426">And that is what is not done under the present law or under the -- excuse me, under the present conditions that the Commission imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.203" offset="2332191">Now that is the basic requirement of Section 5 (2) (f) in the second sentence and that is the only position which we have taken and this position, we think, this type of protection allows great flexibility to the Commission in prescribing terms and conditions while retaining at the same time, the employment protection concept which is unchanged from the original language of the Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.589" offset="2445772">For example, in the original Harrington amendment, they prohibited displacement of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.558" offset="2465625">An employee couldn't be given another job.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.383" offset="2472939">They froze him in the job and that isn't done we believe, here.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.427" offset="2489031">As I say this is the same position we took before the Commission and before the District Court at page 181 of the transcript of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.242" offset="2524348">Judge O'Sullivan asked me during that argument and said, “Those employees shall have what you call, their job's frozen for not less than a period of time that they were employed prior to the effective date, is that your position?”</text>
            <text syncTime="617.302" offset="2572622">I answered, “Yes, Your Honor,” perhaps it is semantics, but I really don't believe it can be called job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.638" offset="2593938">They do not freeze the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.738" offset="2602297">They freeze the employment situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.713" offset="2610239">In other words, the -- the employee could not be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.532" offset="2621524">The jobs can be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.393" offset="2628942">The employees may have to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.285" offset="2636466">They may get other jobs, but they have to be comparable jobs at comparable wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.782" offset="2658513">The jobs are not necessarily frozen.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.173" offset="2668022">That is our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.548" offset="5529579">Representative Warren as I say says that this -- this means precisely what the former language meant because 275 members of the House had requested the conferees during the first conference when they heard that they might strike that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.995" offset="5591333">They said they petitioned him to keep it in and the -- and they not only struck that amendment but they struck all -- all provisions about consolidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.788" offset="5670536">If the House wishes to write its bill and wishes its will to be upheld rather than accept a new measure written by 12 conferees where its will was ignored, then you will vote to recommit this Conference Report with instructions to place back in it what you, by overwhelming majorities, had previously voted for and at that point, the congressional record notes that these words were greeted with applause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.099" offset="5759770">Mr. Thomas got up and said he was for continuous employment and for that reason, he was voting for the motion to recommit, because it had the Harrington amendment in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.964" offset="5807208">These are the only words which will relate directly to the phrase, “worse position with respect to employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.545" offset="5829569">Now, if all parties agree that if Harrington's amendment had not been modified in the Wadsworth motion to recommit and we now had the law saying no unemployment, no displacement and no deprivation or impairment of employment rights, there's no question of what that would mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.580" offset="5905742">Then, the men would have to stay and they could not even be changed from one job to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.361" offset="5960808">It means what I would think Mr. Harrison or excuse me, Mr. Harrington and the other members of the House who were the proponents of that type of legislation, intended it to mean and said it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.543" offset="6009501">And in this, we follow the admonition of this Court that is not -- that it is not to the proponents of legislation, but to the proponents that we go to determine what legislation means in the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.978" offset="6923264">The -- there were a couple of excerpts from briefs which were written in 1941, I believe, by members of the firm of which now, I am a member, in which they spoke of -- of compensation, getting down to wages as a matter of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.668" offset="6986062">In the case that was cited, I think it was the Fort Worth &amp; the D.C. case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.996" offset="7007378">There, the adverse effect was going to take place after four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.655" offset="7025977">No adverse effect was going to take place within the four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.304" offset="7040606">This was very early in the game insofar as employment protection or employee protection was concerned, nobody had evolved a specific type of protection for these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.395" offset="7088985">The railroad wanted -- said this means employment protection, but it's limited to four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.011" offset="7107375">And after four years, we have to give them nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.864" offset="7118869">That's all we have to give them, nothing after four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.241" offset="7128377">We're happy to keep them all just exactly where they are for four years and that's all this means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.981" offset="7147290">The RLEA, at that time, had to take a position that these people must be protected and compensation protection certainly applies to them after four years and the few who may be affected during that four years, should also get compensation protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.726" offset="7206327">That was no time that in -- bring this issue in, bring the New Orleans issue in and all the rest because obviously, that -- in that type of situation it just didn't permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.351" offset="7248750">It couldn't achieve anything where you have also so many important issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.353" offset="7268812">Now, the -- I think there was one oral argument that was referred to and that the same problem was there involved on whether the ICC should get involved in -- in seniority problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.633" offset="7325863">And a member again of the law firm of which I'm a member said, “No, they should.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.429" offset="7353135">But in this particular case, it devolved to a question of wages, because the men who were there being affected were not even employees of the carriers which were involved in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.218" offset="7392214">That was the Pere Marquette case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.468" offset="7401200">It was a third carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.204" offset="7412172">So they should get protection as in -- in both of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.791" offset="7426487">In the first case is (Inaudible) case, the Commission disclaimed any or rather, they denied the -- the application and therefore, made no construction themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.873" offset="7474866">Now, in 1950, when the New Orleans case came up, that again, involved what happens after four years, not what happens during the four-year period and there, it had been 10 years then, since Section 5 (2) (f) had been passed and it was quite obvious from the way the Commission reacted as to the type of protection and the -- the time limit on the protection and the way the District Court reacted as to the time limit on the protection, that it would've been legal suicide to raise this issue at that time, as to what -- what type of protection was limited and was required by the -- by the first in the -- during the first four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.521" offset="7645497">There was no reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.684" offset="7650095">There wasn't an issue and it was foolish to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.319" offset="7664619">The -- now, those are the only positions, if you can call them that that have been taken on the statute and the Commission that is meted by everyone that the Commission has never decided this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.308" offset="7720626">It has never been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.165" offset="7728044">There is no dispute on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.584" offset="7733687">The issue is -- has never been raised and it has never been decided and in that respect, that it isn't -- it is in the same category as the statements of -- rather, the same category of the rule which was announced recently by this Court in the Baltimore and Ohio Railway Company against Jackson, where for 60 years, the Interstate Commerce Commission had considered Maintenance of Way vehicles not subject to the Safety of Plants Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.010" offset="7851447">And they said that this was a consistent administrative interpretation which was -- persuasive evidence that Congress never intended them to be covered by that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.022" offset="7895437">This Court, however, held that while it is true that long administrative practice is entitled to wait, there has been no express administrative determination of the problem and we believe that petitioner over speaks in elevating negative action to positive administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.543" offset="7961579">In our view, the failure of the Commission to act is not a binding administrative interpretation that Congress did not intend these guards to come within the purview of these Acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.500" offset="8141406">But Your Honor as I say, when you look at the plain language, the plain language says “employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.902" offset="8162931">Employment in that -- in this statute is not used in any -- as any term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.716" offset="8186232">It just says employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.198" offset="8192188">There is nothing in the -- in 5 (2) (f), in Section 5 or in the entire Interstate Commerce Act, which would indicate that this particular phrase is used in any other sense than its normal, natural, accepted meaning of “state of being employed,” as Webster defines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.390" offset="8264913">In addition, the term “worse position with respect to compensation” was clearly before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.534" offset="8297514">It had been used in the Transportation Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.018" offset="8311411">It had been used in the Washington Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.914" offset="8323009">And had Congress just meant compensation and fringe benefits as the Government and the other appellees -- the appellees contend then it would have been an easy matter just to say “worse position with respect to compensation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.199" offset="8380165">They would've achieved their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.043" offset="8387584">Now, in answer to that in the court below, the Government claimed that you couldn't use “worse position with respect to compensation”, because that entire clause was a -- was a term of art and it implied, as a term of art, continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.161" offset="8456025">And we say that if “worse position with respect to compensation” implies continued employment, then most certainly, “worse position with respect to employment” requires continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.601" offset="8505762">Now, another point in the briefs, the counsel for the appellees have stated that the words, “affected” in Section 5 (2) are very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.242" offset="8556335">That 5 (2) (f) was passed to protect affected employees and how in the world can you protect an affected employee if he's not affected in the first place which he wouldn't be, they say, if there was a strict job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.521" offset="8617462">We say he is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.596" offset="8621746">He's affected by transfers and by giving different jobs, but aside from that, it's significant in the way that Congress used that term, “affected” in relation to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.597" offset="8657795">In the first sentence, which is clearly applicable only to compensation protection, protection which comes after the effect, they say that the Commission shall provide this protection to railroad employees affected, but in the second sentence of Section 5 (2) (f), it's entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.148" offset="8735953">They say that they shall protect employees of carriers affected and keep them in no worse position with respect to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.437" offset="8769076">And we believe that this -- the significant difference in the use of these words in the two sentences is important and significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.689" offset="8806170">Thirdly, if we look to the Emergency Transportation Act, we find that Congress said, “No employee shall be deprived of employment under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.064" offset="8847653">No employee shall be placed in a worse position with respect to compensation for employment, as a result of this Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.049" offset="8879522">So, when they wanted perhaps, to change Mr. Harrington's language and get rid of the displacement problem and permit transfers and so forth, they went back as we must assume they did, to the Emergency Transportation Act and took the two phrases and combined the two phrases into one, thereby accomplishing all that was accomplished by that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.531" offset="8977533">Now, these appellees are confronted with the language of Mr. Harrington, of Mr. Warren and of Mr. Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.600" offset="9017762">And in order to show that “worse position with respect to employment” does not contain the concept of continued employment, they must explain away their language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.363" offset="9060812">Now, the Eerie-Lackawanna explains it away in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.136" offset="9075963">They are driven of the astounding contention that you can't take what these men say at their face value because it was an election year and they were probably just talking for their constituents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.011" offset="9111385">The Government says, “You can't take it at its face value either, because although Harrington and they quote Harrington, they quote the statement that I read where Harrington said, “Job eliminations will come from natural attrition as deaths and retirements, etcetera, occur,” but you can't believe Harrington, because although Harrington told you what the effect of this language was, he didn't tell you why he changed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.078" offset="9199679">We submit that he didn't have to tell us why he changed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.237" offset="9212322">It's obvious that it was changed and it's obvious that he said precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.612" offset="9229772">Now, they don't comment, incidentally on the words of Warren or Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.495" offset="9257357">I don't believe they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.306" offset="9268642">I would like to discuss for a moment, if I may, the -- the two cases upon which relied this -- rely the two decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.545" offset="9301556">Before I get ahead of myself, I'd like to say this, the three times Congress had voted on employment protection, the House Act, they voted on the original Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.431" offset="9341053">They had sent this petition, 275 of them, to the conferees and they had voted on the Wadsworth motion to recommit, which they have been told and which they thought meant employment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.380" offset="9380864">Now, when Mr. Lea came out of that Second Conference Committee, Mr. Lea, one of the most outspoken opponents of this legislation from the beginning in either its original or modified form, when he came out of that House or that Committee, he knew the temper of this House of Representatives and he knew and that if they had removed employment protection, they might well kill the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.375" offset="9476890">Confronted with this House of Representatives that had voted three times for employment protection, he did not say that that protection had been removed and if he thought it had been removed, he was under a compelling and pressing moral obligation to say so and he didn't say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.569" offset="9553690">Now, to the cases -- the opinions upon which we rely, first, there is the opinion in this Court's decision in Railway Labor Executives' Association against United States, 339 U.S. 142 and second, this Court's opinion in the Order of Railroad Telegraphers against the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad Company, 362 U.S. 330.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.424" offset="9657031">In the first case, the RLEA case, the Court was concerned with the type of protection to be afforded after the four-year period referred to in the second sentence, had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.231" offset="9704260">The Court reviewed the legislative history of both sentences, said that the Harrington amendment as originally worded -- pardon me, threatened to prevent all consolidations to which it related and that as reported out of the second conference it contained, a substantial change which limited it to the four years following the effective date -- pardon me, of the Commission's order of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.648" offset="9797987">The only reference in Court's decision to the prohibitory effect of the Harrington amendment was where it said that the Harrington amendment's otherwise prohibitory effect was limited time wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.362" offset="9852844">The -- that were the only reference to prohibitory effect was to the statement that it threatened to prevent all consolidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.101" offset="9883773">No other limitation was considered by this Court in that decision, as we view it, as having been placed upon the Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.292" offset="9916583">And in the ORT case, this Court supported its decision that job stabilization was a bargainable issue under the Railway Labor Act and therefore, not subject to the injunctive procedures under Norris-LaGuardia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.549" offset="9969560">By referring to the second sentence of Section 5 (2) (f) of the Interstate Commerce Act and by reading that sentence in this way, Section 5 (2) (f) requires the Commission to protect employees by including terms and conditions which provide that for a term of years after a consolidation, employees shall not be placed in a worse position with respect to their employment than they otherwise would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.366" offset="10072795">That this statement appears to be a recognition of the employment protection provided by 5 (2) (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.917" offset="10095052">It is confirmed, we believe, by reference to the dissenting opinion in the ORT case, which stated that nothing in Section 5 (2) (f) authorized the Commission to freeze existing jobs and quoted from the Court's opinion of the RLEA case as follows, “So Harrington proviso, this Court said in Railway Labor Executives' Association against United States that it threatened to prevent all consolidations to which it related, but Congress made it workable by putting a time limit upon its otherwise prohibitory effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.147" offset="10219917">The dissent goes on to say, “If Congress did more, it eliminated any power to freeze jobs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.030" offset="10239457">Now, this dissenting opinion seems to us, clearly to recognize that the language quoted by the Court in the RLEA case interprets the four-year limit as the -- time limit as the only time limit placed upon employment protection in the Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.422" offset="10305076">The -- the plain language of this statute, we believe, is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.081" offset="10331721">It requires employment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.952" offset="10339140">It speaks only in terms of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.853" offset="10350738">The legislative history, we believe, is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.298" offset="10364531">Mr. Harrington is the man to whom we must go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.828" offset="10382712">He is the author and to -- also to the proponents of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.351" offset="10400789">And they were quite clear in what they meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.329" offset="10412701">Now, if this were unwise legislation, if this meant that there would be some employees for some time carried over and they wouldn't have any work to do perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.274" offset="10464423">It doesn't mean the railroad couldn't split it up and provide work perhaps, but suppose they wouldn't have any work to do, that as we respectfully submit, is for Congress to decide and not for the Court and I'm sure the Court agrees if it were to find that that is what the law says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.469" offset="10529207">But in this case, that won't happen, because as they have said, “862 men would be the only ones deprived of employment and they would only be deprived because they wouldn't transfer” and under this law, they would have to transfer, as --- as we view it, they would have to transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.237" offset="11088332">In that same period, 12,000 would be created by attrition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.205" offset="11104214">Now, this might not mean there would be 600% in each category of employment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2801.739" offset="11310373">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.175" offset="11344123">In our view, there is only one issue in this case, whether the Interstate Commerce Commission is required to condition all railroad mergers and other consolidations and I shall use those words very loosely, upon terms preserving jobs for all the employees employed before the merger or might permit the dismissal of unnecessary employees upon guaranteeing them against all loss or other prejudice to a system of 100% financial compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.825" offset="11494693">It may give some perspective I think, if I were to state first, our understanding of the statute as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.438" offset="11525099">It appears at page 2 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.924" offset="11547042">The first sentence directs the Commission to require a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interest of railroad employees affected by a merger or consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.007" offset="11599391">These words obviously delegate a very broad discretion, including the power, as this Court held in the Railway Labor Executives' case, to require protection going beyond the statutory four-year minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.616" offset="11653831">Then the second sentence, which is the crux of this -- is the crux of this case, I dwell at the moment only to point out that it fulfills a useful purpose either under the appellants' interpretation or under ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.123" offset="11719868">For under either interpretation, it guarantees a minimum degree of protection below which the Commission may not see -- sink.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.769" offset="11754454">Four years guarantee a minimum in amount, 100% guarantee against financial loss and a guarantee in length of time, the four years that I've mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.353" offset="11804818">Then the third sentence, preserves the right to the parties to engage in collective bargaining upon the consequences of a merger, including as the Court has held although not in a direct interpretation of this Section, including the right to bargain about whether unnecessary jobs will be preserved or at least, will not be discontinued without the ascent of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.132" offset="11915891">I emphasize therefore, that there is no question here either about collective bargaining or about whether the railroad has a duty to protect employees against the consequences of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.238" offset="11976286">The day for arguing those issues is passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.402" offset="11993004">In either event here, there is to be for the statutory period, full protection against being worse off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.242" offset="12028322">The only question is how shall it be achieved?</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.709" offset="12042219">Is it to be achieved by what we have called a job freeze and I accept Mr. Mahoney's interpretation of a freeze of comparable -- a freeze in comparable jobs and comparable wages, which is all we mean by the expression, “job freeze” or is it to be through full financial protection?</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.960" offset="12123199">The Commission's order in the present case not only gives the most elaborate protection ever known in the railroad industry, but a degree of protection which goes far beyond anything known outside the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.214" offset="12180250">Displaced employees, those whose jobs are abolished and who exercise seniority rights to move into other less well-paying positions, are guaranteed a monthly displacement allowance equal to difference between their prior average earnings and what they earned in the new job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.372" offset="12256841">What the Commission calls dismissed employees and what I would call laid off employees because the employment relationship isn't terminated, they still have seniority rights, those who lose their jobs as a result of the merger, are guaranteed a -- the full average wage which they earned in the year preceding the merger, so that they are protected there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.526" offset="12361435">In addition, every employee affected by the merger, whether he's dismissed or laid off, is guaranteed all the other incidental benefits attached to his previous employment, free transportation, hospital and medical insurance, pensions, things of that kind, whatever done through the collective bargaining agreement, though it's not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.386" offset="12452968">Every employee who is forced to move is guaranteed his full moving expenses and finally, anyone who is forced to sell his house or to cancel a lease is guaranteed against any loss by reason of that transaction and these benefits all run for the full statutory period or in some cases, they may run still longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.440" offset="12557145">It's really a little hard to think of any way in which you could do more to prevent employees from being worse off because of a merger, but I would emphasize that in this case in any event, there is no question about the adequacy of the Commission's order, if financial protection can ever meet the statutory requirement because the appellants stipulated in the court below that the only question concerned the interpretation of the statute and if there are any financial inadequacies in the order, they've suggested some in the brief, they are both excluded by the stipulation, but I should also say that, under Section 5 (9) of the statute, they have the right to go back before the Commission and ask for this additional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.554" offset="12749615">And the Commission has authorized me to say that any such request would certainly be considered and if I read the railroad's brief right, they've said that they will grant any additional financial protection, if it were shown that the Commission's order fell short.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.135" offset="12883884">Similarly, because of the stipulation, I would emphasize that there was no question here about the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the Commission's finding that financial compensation is the most satisfactory way of both protecting the employees and permitting the merger to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.075" offset="12963715">There's an explicit finding on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.376" offset="12972910">It's not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.379" offset="12976880">Indeed, the evidence isn't even here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.282" offset="12992449">So that the chief, indeed, the only real difference between the kind of job freeze that the appellants see and the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commission is that the appellants would force the carriers to provide jobs for unnecessary employees, whereas, the order permits a reduction of forces upon consolidating facilities, but guarantees the employees against all forms of financial injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.573" offset="13129644">I would, because of the questions about it earlier, like to speak to the point just very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.591" offset="13153782">I take it that what Mr. Mahoney means by the employees are entitled to comparable jobs, is that an engineer is entitled to continue to be an engineer and an electrician is entitled to continue to be an electrician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.402" offset="13229014">You can't put an engineer toward trek walking or keeping books or doing clerical work, because they would say, “For obvious reasons in the craft history of the industry, that that was not a comparable job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.605" offset="13281782">So what you have to do if consolidation for example, of the -- the yard facilities at Buffalo, which is one of the important parts here, makes it necessary to have only half as many train crews in the yard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.212" offset="13748224">The history begins with the enactment of the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.399" offset="13776959">Section 7 (b), which appears on page 24 of our brief, set a formula below which the number of employees in the industry could not be reduced and then, went on and provided, “Nor shall any employee in such service be deprived of employment such as he had during the month of May,” which was the lease period, “Nor be in a worse position with respect to his compensation for such employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.901" offset="13899003">That would cover the case when he was displaced, by reason of any action taken under the Act and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.713" offset="13934216">Now, this enactment clearly does provide for what I call a job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.095" offset="13967757">I emphasize only that it -- when Congress desired to do this, it very clearly used the language of a job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.552" offset="14001612">In the contrast to the present law, are they -- needs to be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.639" offset="14017912">The next development was the Washington Job Protection Agreement of 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.817" offset="14050617">This was negotiated between about 80% of the mileage of the railroads and carriers and the Standard Railway Labor Organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.076" offset="14091682">And it becomes the basis of all subsequent progress in this field and consequently, I would like to ask the Court to look at it in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.389" offset="14140897">Turning to page 142 of the record, Section 6 of the agreement -- I confine myself to the key section, Section 6 of the agreement --</text>

            <text syncTime="3526.978" offset="14211323">Section 6 is just below the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.256" offset="14224384">It provided what was called a displacement allowance for employees who were kept in service, but transferred to other positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.883" offset="14270882">And it read in the critical part, “No employee of any of the carriers involved in a particular coordination,” which was their word for all mergers, consolidations, leases and everything else, “Who has continued in service, shall prepare to five years, following the effective date of such coordination, be placed as a result of such coordination, in a worse position with respect to compensation and rules governing working conditions” and then over on the next page, paragraph (c), measures the monthly allowance that he would receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.762" offset="14414451">I dwell on this particular section because you will note that the words, “put in a worse position with respect to compensation” were used in speaking of displaced employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.440" offset="14465128">They were never used in speaking of employees laid off or other kinds of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.318" offset="14488639">I think this bears upon the question, well, why didn't they use the language, “put in a worse position with respect to their compensation” in later statutory enactments?</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.154" offset="14528031">They'd had a special position both here and in the Railroad Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.722" offset="14558229">Section 7, at the bottom of page 143, provides what was there called a coordination allowance for employees that were laid off as the result of any consolidation of railroad facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.849" offset="14618728">There are two things about it which are important to later development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.485" offset="14637328">In the first place, the allowance was set at only 60% of the employee's average compensation during prior periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.899" offset="14674944">And in the second place, as shown over at the top of page 144, the period for which you might receive the payment was fairly short, at least in terms of later standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.234" offset="14724263">For example, in order to get a four-year protection, you had to have at least 10 years seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.996" offset="14751326">Whereas, we know under the statute now, four years seniority would give you the four-year protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.274" offset="14776508">Then the other provisions of the Washington Agreement, which I needn't stress at the same detail, cover the points which we find later in the order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.835" offset="14818722">Section 8, at the top of 147, guarantees all fringe benefits, the free travel, transportation and other kinds of allowances, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.730" offset="14862294">At page 148, you will find the reimbursement from moving expenses and then over on page -- bottom of 148 and over on 149 and 150, is the machinery protecting employees in the event of the sale of their homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.860" offset="14934810">Here then, we had a negotiated agreement covering the bulk of the industry which sought to provide partial financial protection, but which did not imply any kind of a job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.883" offset="14994892">Then we come to the Transportation Act of 1940, which wrote into the Interstate Commerce Act, the language involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.968" offset="15035225">At that time, the Congress had before it, two distinct examples, the Emergency Railroad Act of 1933, which had the language of a guarantee of employment and also a guarantee against displacement and the negotiated financial protection of the Washington Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.436" offset="15125086">There's no need to go through the early stages of the legislative history of the legislation of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.814" offset="15154657">It's enough to say that the Committee of Six, appointed by President Roosevelt, which framed the 1940 legislation, the House and Senate Committees and the Senate itself, all clearly went down the road of financial protection based on the Washington Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.177" offset="15236054">The bills which they drafted included language very similar to the first sentence of Section 5 (2) (f), including the language about requiring the Commission to set up a fair and equitable arrangement for the protection of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.886" offset="15306898">And it was in that form that the bill passed the Senate also came to the House floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.573" offset="15333648">On the House floor, there's not the slightest doubt that the House originally switched signals and wrote into the bill, a guarantee of continued employment, despite merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.417" offset="15401044">This was the Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.480" offset="15409298">It put a proviso after the authority to the Commission to prescribe a fair and equitable arrangement, which stipulated that no such transaction shall be approved by the Commission if such transaction will result in unemployment or displacement, not that it's both unemployment and displacement and not just one of the carrier or carriers or in the impairment of the existing employment rights of said employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.505" offset="15525386">There were some Congressmen who asserted that this language was never intended to guarantee employees against layoffs as the result of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.437" offset="15561122">But as I said before, it seems to me that the language is perfectly clear and that if this language had become part of the law, we would all say that it was plain on the face of it that a guarantee of continued employment was the result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3893.741" offset="15678360">That was in the report -- legislative report made by the Interstate Commerce Commission during the Conference Committee discussion, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.104" offset="15715767">There were, I should point out, two sources of support for the Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.725" offset="15742307">One was made up of those who were looking for a job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.710" offset="15758190">The other sources of support were those who said to put it very colloquially, “We don't know whether we can trust these administrative agencies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.339" offset="15792776">We have one notion of what is a fair and equitable arrangement, but quite often, we find that the agencies have different notions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.514" offset="15829452">And therefore, they wished to write into the said statutes some requirement, some rule that would bind the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.838" offset="15870725">As it's been said, the Harrington amendment went into the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.638" offset="15889951">The bill went to conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.605" offset="15897788">And when the bill -- when the Conference Committee reported, it resolved this conflict between the Senate bill which had no Harrington amendment and the House bill which did, by leaving out of the legislation all provisions about mergers and consolidations and therefore, they took no position upon it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.849" offset="15994755">When the report came before the House, Representative Wadsworth offered a motion to recommit to the Conference Committee with instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.485" offset="16041357">And the language of that motion it seems to me to be highly important here, because it is radically different from the Harrington amendment and as we see it, this is really the critical step in the legislative history and therefore, I'll impose on the Court to call attention to it in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.450" offset="16121187">The motion moved to recommit the bill with instructions to the managers on the part of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.171" offset="16152012">There were three instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.284" offset="16160475">The first, that the managers on the part of the House insist on the inclusion in the report of the Committee of Conference, the provision adopted by the House is the -- known as the Jones amendment, which reads as follows, “And then it set out in so many words the Jones amendment which bar upon water carriers and the rate set by them jointly with the rail carriers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.507" offset="16245426">Then the second instruction again instructed the managers on the part of the House to insist upon the exact language of the Wadsworth amendment, just as it has been offered before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.176" offset="16300074">It set out the Wadsworth amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.506" offset="16309373">Then we come to a very different instruction, the third one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.032" offset="16323480">That the managers on the part of the House insist on the inclusion in the report of the Committee of Conference, the -- the provisions adopted by the House relating to consolidations and combinations of carriers, but modify it so that the sentence in Section 8 which contains the provision known as the Harrington amendment read as follows, and then came the language which is quoted on page 33 of our brief in the full text.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.439" offset="16461093">I won't take time to read it all, but I would emphasize that the second sentence which provided with -- within an order including approving a consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.005" offset="16511352">“The Commission shall include terms and conditions, including that such transactions will not result in employees of said carrier or carriers being in any worse position with respect to their employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.265" offset="16568404">Now obviously, this was not just a technical change in the phraseology aimed at simplification or brevity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.104" offset="16599751">The Harrington language had forbidden the approval of a consolidation if there would be any unemployment or any displacement and both those references to unemployment and to displacement were left out of the Wadsworth instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.166" offset="16676028">The Appellants suggest in their brief that the language in the Wadsworth instruction was to come from the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933, but that the language is about -- the language about unemployment and displacement were telescoped and left out apparently, in the interest of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.064" offset="16763591">It seems to me that the significant comparison is just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.688" offset="16778115">That there was an example with a job freeze or an employment freeze and that the Wadsworth instruction or following perhaps the very urging of the Interstate Commerce Commission report that Justice Whittaker mentioned, did not include those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.953" offset="16851153">We submit that one of two conclusions necessarily follows from this change from the language of the Harrington amendment to the Wadsworth instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.239" offset="16896293">One conclusion would be that the Harrington amendment was modified for the specific purpose of avoiding any mandatory job freeze, which would make railroad consolidations impracticable and returning to the idea of financial protection which has been the mainline of development up to that point and the Washington Agreement, the Committee reports, the vote of the Senate and I may add, the support of all the railway labor organizations, except the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.510" offset="17029413">The other possibility that we could conceive of is that the Wadsworth instruction was compromised which left the issue at large, that we will leave it to the Commission to determine how to keep employees from being worse off, allow them to choose within their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.611" offset="17105795">For the purposes of this case, either conclusion would require sustaining the order below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.890" offset="17130977">Because I have said the Commission addressed itself to the question, assuming we have discretion, we find that this is the method of protection which would be most practicable and most to the public interest and that finding has not been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.951" offset="17211225">After the debate on the -- oh, well I should say something one thing more about the debate on the Wadsworth instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.642" offset="17257932">There were three times during the debate that it was pointed out that the language of the Wadsworth instruction was not the language of the Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.999" offset="17307355">This was acknowledged indeed, in one of those instances by Mr. Harrington and it was stated on two separate occasions by Congressman Wolverton, who seemed to be carrying the labor -- laboring oar, in the debate on the labor provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.217" offset="17368273">Congressman Harrington did himself speak of the Wadsworth instruction as if it would freeze employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.886" offset="17414875">I don't think there could be any denying that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.346" offset="17424802">He said a great many things in the course of the speech, but there are one or two sentences which do speak as if he thought that the motion to recommit would involve a job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.650" offset="17469942">As to that, we simply say that in the light of the general course of events, the great significance of the change in language and the other comments made during the debate that the statement by Congressman Harrington is not entitled to any weight here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4378.551" offset="17617586">I didn't mean to imply that he had said anything more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.261" offset="17628453">There wasn't any discussion on the floor by anyone, about the significance of the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.083" offset="17663666">The only thing any of us can draw from the subsequent legislative history is that people made passing comments about the effect of the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.540" offset="17713507">One was Congressman Harrington who did say that it would result in a job freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.337" offset="17732733">He didn't use the words, but he plainly conveyed the idea.</text>

            <text syncTime="4419.326" offset="17780694">It wasn't commented on in -- in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.642" offset="17793964">Similarly, Congressman Lea, several times, attacked the instruction in language which spoke of its compelling a railroad to pay a wage for life to an employee for whom it had no job or an employee who had been discharged and nobody quarreled with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.023" offset="17879437">I -- There -- there just wasn't any debate upon this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.077" offset="17895633">That seems quite possible to me after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.478" offset="17909321">Those who were supporting the instruction were naturally interested in the -- making the most claims for it, in terms of employee protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.024" offset="17955506">Those who were opposing the motion to recommit were naturally content to have it look as bad as it could because they didn't want anything in the bill on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.364" offset="18000854">Now, there were some general statements on the floor to the effect that the Wadsworth instruction would carry out the purposes of the Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.418" offset="18045053">But I submit that those are rather ambiguous because we don't know just what is meant by the purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.528" offset="18073475">But today, in the light of this case, the issue of employment freeze or no employment freeze looks very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.791" offset="18110568">But if you go back and think in terms of the context of that debate in 1940, the great issue was whether you were going to protect the employees at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.500" offset="18149334">There had been nothing in the Conference Report that gave any protection and the Wadsworth instruction, interpreted as we suggest must be interpreted, really was a very great advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.534" offset="18213491">It not only put back in the language about the fair and equitable arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.375" offset="18236897">It narrowed the Commission's discretion by setting a floor below which it could not go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.169" offset="18260093">It went beyond the Washington Agreement by guaranteeing not 60% of your previous wage, but 100% and it gave much greater protection in point of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.107" offset="18311816">So that anyone there who is thinking generally of the protection of employees could say, and honestly say, that this language carries out the purpose of protecting employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.518" offset="18361448">It carries out the great purpose of the Harrington amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.758" offset="18374405">So I see no inconsistency with those general statements in our interpretation of the Wadsworth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.388" offset="18404916">The motion to recommit passed and the bill went back to Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.722" offset="18426232">The Conference Committee reported out what is of course now, Section 5 (2) (f), but made certain changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.237" offset="18472312">The statement of the House managers contains an exposition of Section 5 (2) (f) which seems to me to be -- seems to us to be highly significant and again, worth considering in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.971" offset="18527274">I would like to ask the Court to turn to pages 60 and 61 of the appellants' brief, because what they print and what they omit seems to me to be the key to the essential fallacy in their argument based on the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.454" offset="18621210">The statement of the House managers began with the paragraph at the bottom of page 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.167" offset="18652035">The House amendment included a proviso, the Harrington amendment prohibiting approval of any transaction which would result in unemployment or displacement of employees, or in the impairment of their employment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.229" offset="18712325">There was no similar provision in the Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.861" offset="18726849">Then the statement of the House managers, the so-called Committee report, goes on to explain that in lieu of this provision, the Conference substitute included Section 5 (2) (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.988" offset="18775333">It quoted that in full and then came two paragraphs, which I find very significant, which the Appellants have omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.331" offset="18812740">“The substitute proposal for the Harrington amendment before it began, as recommended by the -- to the conferees by the instructions of the House provided in substance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.076" offset="18863626">I'm emphasizing the, “As recommended by the instructions of the House.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.656" offset="18878046">They knew the difference between the Harrington amendment and the instructions of the House and they quoted --</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="4708.819" offset="18938650">And from a paragraph explaining 5 (2) (f) as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.066" offset="18963623">The paragraph read, “That substitute proposal for the Harrington amendment as recommended to the conferees by the instruction of the House, provided in substance that in the case of consolidations of the unifications,” then I stopped reading because it summarizes the first sentence of Section 5 (2) (f), and the point which I wanted to emphasize was that the House managers observed the distinction between the Harrington amendment and the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.294" offset="19100505">Then the statement went on, “The instruction of the House also made the provisions of the amendment applicable to the case where other means of transportation was substituted for rail transportation and they explained that they had left this out as impracticable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.052" offset="19171558">Then we go on and we find the part of the report bearing directly on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.432" offset="19197053">“The conference agreement on the Harrington amendment includes the provision of the instruction,” again not the contrast between the two, “Which provides that the order of approval shall include terms and conditions providing the transaction will not result in employees being in a worse position as a result -- with respect to their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.000" offset="19279391">The conference agreement qualifies this provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.959" offset="19291199">In other words, the provision of the instruction, not any provision of the Harrington amendment and that explains I think why it is in the -- in a later sentence in this passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.561" offset="19341667">The House managers refer to the time limitation as something that cuts off or terminates the period for which benefits will require -- be required to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.668" offset="19402062">They know that benefits were what were required and not an employment freeze.</text>
