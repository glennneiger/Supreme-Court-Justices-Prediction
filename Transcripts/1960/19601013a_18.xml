            <label>Mr. George Cochran Doub</label>
            <text syncTime="14.823" offset="162670">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.080" offset="175731">This is an appeal from the -- a decision of the Supreme Court of Kansas refusing to recognize a federal right of redemption granted the United States in a federal statute, refusing to do -- sell in a mortgage foreclosure case where the United States held a junior lien and was wiped out by the foreclosure sale of the first mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.291" offset="284505">Now, the appeal presents for the first time, the interpretation to be accorded 28 U.S.C. 2410 (c), and whether it's explicit ground of this redemption right was intended to apply when in conflict with state law and if so, is the directive of the federal statute balanced?</text>
            <text syncTime="71.351" offset="388786">Now these questions were not determined in your recent decision in the Brosnan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.402" offset="413027">There, you dealt with the scope of 2410 and drastically limited its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.572" offset="449703">Here we deal with the interpretation of the statute where it was expressly invoked to subject the United States to process in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.507" offset="513442">I'd like to call your attention to the language of the statute before dealing with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.430" offset="537057">It's found in our main brief at page 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.987" offset="587316">And just to remind you of the terms of the statute, in paragraph (a) it waives the sovereign immunity of the United States and provides that under the conditions defined in the statute, the United States maybe made a party in a suit to acquire a title or to foreclose a mortgage upon property in which the Government claims an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.213" offset="716257">And (b) paragraph defines how that service will be effective, machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.965" offset="743215">And the (c) paragraph with which we deal here, says that the judicial sale of the property will have the same effect as to discharging the Government's lien as state law might provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.010" offset="815417">And then it contains this sentence on page 34, where a sale of real estate is made to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.481" offset="881246">The United States shall have one year from the date of sale within which to redeem.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.511" offset="917400">Now, you'll notice there is only one condition prescribed for the application of that clear and unequivocal directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.296" offset="952508">And that is where that the sale is made to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.405" offset="988975">Now, the facts in this case where these.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.838" offset="1006738">The Farmers' Home Administration, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, under a loan program for the benefit of livestock farmers who could not obtain loans elsewhere, may -- four loans to a farmer in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.487" offset="1093360">Now, three of the loans were unsecured, one of the four notes involved was secured by a second lien subject to a $25,000 mortgage on the farm held by the John Hancock Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.374" offset="1172877">Now, I'd like to point out this, that there are 10 federal agencies making loans to assist farmers and -- and business.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.730" offset="1234317">They are all serving a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.051" offset="1247587">They're not private loans for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.903" offset="1262947">In other words, we -- this -- this little agency alone and the Department of Agriculture has made loans totaling 81 million as I am told.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.039" offset="1303489">But the loans, the Commodity Credit Corporation, the ICC, the RFC, Maritime Administrators, small business administration, about five others, totaling a billion and they all have authority to loan on second liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.582" offset="1377677">So the question here is one of considerable significance to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.187" offset="1408084">Now, the first lien money lender instituted a foreclosure proceeding on its defaulted first mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.452" offset="1445177">And unlike the situation in Brosnan, Kansas law required the junior leinors be made parties to the proceeding of the insurance company made service a process upon the United States under 2410, which was the only way to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.041" offset="1527515">And it's conceded by the appellees in their brief at page 5 that 2410 was invoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.948" offset="2611179">If that occur, then you would have to look, the constitutional question would be, can Congress waive the sovereign immunity of the United States (Inaudible) upon the -- this condition that it have the right of redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.805" offset="2714624">In other words, can Congress impose a not unreasonable condition to waiver of sovereign immunity?</text>
            <text syncTime="660.835" offset="2746702">And when you cast the constitutional question in those terms, you find there is no constitutional question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.803" offset="2778572">Now, the Supreme Court of Kansas on the appeal held first that -- that the Government's motion had properly raised its right to redeem and the trial court had, in fact, assumed jurisdiction and that it overruled their motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.718" offset="2862268">I might say that after we attempted to redeem, the Clerk refused to take our money, we then filed a motion in the Kansas for -- for recognition of their right and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.906" offset="2919006">And as the -- the Supreme Court of Kansas also, as I interpreted the opinion which is not very clear and I think is ambiguous, it ruled that the Government's redemption rights are governed by state and not by federal law because 2410 gave the Government no rights that were superior to those of private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.187" offset="3032168">Now, what did 2410 accomplished and what is the pertinency of your decision in Brosnan?</text>
            <text syncTime="739.308" offset="3060590">It's our position that since the plaintiff utilized 2410 to subject us to process, and this was the only method by which we could -- be brought in to that foreclosure case, the Government was guaranteed its one year redemption right as the statute put it for its protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.292" offset="3148570">And as a matter of fact, the opinion in the Brosnan case says that very thing that the Government is guaranteed a right of redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.329" offset="3192665">And we say that this is a categoric imparity by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.229" offset="3220250">It -- it couched in clear and unequivocal language.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.456" offset="3237177">There's no condition that we think can be read into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.401" offset="3252955">And it's inconceivable that Congress could've intended that this right should be dependent upon a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.792" offset="3298513">As a matter of fact, the -- the legislative history shows that Congress is perfectly aware that in most states, no such right existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.734" offset="3346265">And if there had been a uniform policy of the states to provide such a right in junior lienors or even a general right, there would have been no need for the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.783" offset="4162539">Now then -- and they brought us into the case under 2410.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.994" offset="4187303">In our answer, all we ask for was that -- that our claim to be recognized with the second lien in any excess proceeds be distributed to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.483" offset="4237354">But, under Kansas law, the Court entered judgment on all claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.555" offset="4517595">In a clear case, Mr. Justice Brennan, that's -- you're right in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.301" offset="4540583">Certainly, we point out that in the sentence following the redemption when it says in any case for the (Inaudible) United States, view, United States led by way of affirmative relief for the foreclosure and between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.720" offset="4598262">Now their second contention is that the -- the federal redemption right doesn't apply on any excess proceeds of the sale might possibly or conceivably be -- be applied under state law of the junior lien claim of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.935" offset="4679137">Well, of course there weren't any excess proceeds in this particular case but it is the norm, usual, established policy in an interstate foreclosure laws for any excess proceeds to go to junior lien creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.244" offset="4756355">So if such a condition were written into this federal statute, the redemption right would come so sterilized as to be completely (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.740" offset="4802330">Now, we say there is no such proviso or limitation in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.347" offset="4820720">And it cannot be read into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.431" offset="4841096">The appellee insert that the redemption right was not intended to apply whenever it conflicts with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.672" offset="4878085">And they rely upon the first sentence of 2410 (c) saying that a judicial sale shall have the effect of -- with respect to the discharge of lien as local law provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.252" offset="4948407">Well, under that provision, of course we were wiped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.383" offset="4980903">And the fact general provision dealt with the -- wiped out consequences of a foreclosure sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.368" offset="5024893">But the third sentence of the paragraph deals with a specific redemption right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.701" offset="5054151">And under elementary statute principle, the statutory interpretation and general provision yields through a specific provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.170" offset="5096051">So obviously, that first sentence deals with an entirely different subject from the redemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.649" offset="5153938">So we say that while Congress might have chosen to subject our redemption right to state law and clearly did not do so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.180" offset="5196048">And because whenever Congress did not wish us to have this redemption right, they said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.209" offset="5232201">Their statute which we cite in our brief for that Congress said, "We will not have it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.233" offset="5252263">We shall not have this right in certain specific situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.507" offset="5273370">I'm reminded of what the British (Inaudible) said in quoting our petition, a British Judge in the pleading cases of the common law because I think he summed up a good deal of the law, of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.066" offset="5351633">It says if Parliament did not mean what he said -- it should -- it should have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.598" offset="5381726">And I think that principle here is quite applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.579" offset="5425716">And the final -- their final contention is that if the federal statute conflicts with state law, state law controls in spite of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.897" offset="5474931">I'd like to just point out that when the United States enters into contracts of this kind, informed programs of this kind, do not deserve a commercial purpose, not to enter into private business but to perform a great social public function in exercising a constitutional power and the contract including the notes, the mortgages are means of executing those federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.790" offset="5614529">But as I -- as I pointed out in answer to Mr. Justice Douglas' question, the -- the constitutional question cannot be cast merely in terms of this redemption right, it has to be cast in terms of 2410 as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.521" offset="5709406">Whether Congress has the power to waive immunity and enable the United States to be subject in the state process upon a condition which is not unreasonable or capricious, we say that question answers itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.066" offset="6215659">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.757" offset="6230392">It seems to me that the practice of this matter surrounds a fact which has been under emphasized to say the least insofar as the Government's argument is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.675" offset="6278040">At the time the United States step put inside the courthouse door in Edwards County, Kansas it did so in accordance with our argument not so much as a party defendant but as a party plaintiff seeking affirmative relief against a codefendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.240" offset="6360377">The record indicates and Mr. Douglas indicated in his oral argument that the United States did not merely answer but it filed its classification seeking specific affirmative relief against the Hetzels, the appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.179" offset="6444074">It seems to me then that if a condition upon the waiver of sovereign immunity of United States is a right of redemption that that right of redemption is lost when the United States seeks to assert itself as a plaintiff rather than merely as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.985" offset="6535293">And it is our argument that that is precisely what the United States did when it went into the District Court in the State of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.021" offset="6575417">The question argued by the Government might better be here had they not sought the affirmative relief on the three unsecured notes that are now a part of the subject matter of this action when the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company filed a suite, it did in fact bring the United States in the pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2410.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.557" offset="6681579">But it brought it in only because it held a lien on a piece of property involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.471" offset="6705298">But when the United States filed its answer in its cross petition it was not satisfied to merely answer and concern itself with the piece of the property involved but rather it's opted to seek affirmative relief on three additional notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.651" offset="6769977">Mr. Doub has indicated that those were all Farmers' Home Administration notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.460" offset="6793174">Actually though perhaps the governor of the Farm Credit Administration was in a sense a predecessor of the Farmers' Home Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.169" offset="6832044">It was the governor of the Farm Credit Administration who in fact made the loans for which the promissory notes were issued by the Hetzels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.165" offset="6864018">One of those was made back in 1934, one of them was made in 1936 and the other in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.089" offset="6895679">None of those notes had the least thing to do with the piece of property that was being traditionally foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.767" offset="6922428">So it is our argument then that when the United States sought affirmative relief in the courts of Kansas it subjected itself to the rules and procedures of the State of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.089" offset="6971747">A long line of cases from this Court and from other courts indicate that a sovereign is in no different position than any other litigant when it goes into the forum of another sovereign and seeks affirmative relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.686" offset="7722088">Our general statutes, Section 3107 of Chapter 60 which is included in the appendix of the governor's -- Government's brief indicate that a personal judgment must in fact be made before the lien is imposed on the property that's being judicially foreclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.239" offset="7860328">And that picks us into another portion of the appellees argument concerning whether or not this sale was made to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.120" offset="7915813">Mr. Justice Whittaker's question brought this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.115" offset="7927829">The statute says that the Government shall have its right of redemption at such time as a sale is made, a judicial sale is made to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.005" offset="7983417">It is appellees' position that the sale here was not made just to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States, but were made to satisfy the lien of the United States as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.501" offset="8033364">That's clearly indicated in the judgment of the District Court as shown in page 24 of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.381" offset="8064920">The District Court indicated that following the sale the proceeds were to go first to pay the cost of the actions and to pay the taxes then to pay the first mortgagor, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company and then to pay the second lien in favor of the defendant to the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.742" offset="8146317">So that this then was not a sale made solely to satisfy an entire lien but it was a sale made to satisfy the lien of the United States as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.544" offset="8185501">Then if there were excessive funds they were to be paid out in accordance with the direction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.393" offset="8208906">But it seems to me to be clear from the judgment of the District Court that the sale was made for the purpose of satisfying both the prior lien and the lien of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.491" offset="8273377">Now there is a means that a junior lien holder can protect himself in Kansas and that is by appearing in bidding into sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.610" offset="8309844">Our Supreme Court in the State of Kansas is often held that that is the only way the junior lien holder can be assured that he's not going to lose his interest in the piece of property, because if he should not appear and if the proceeds from the sale did not bring enough money to pay for the junior lien holder's interest and if the defendant mortgagor does redeem the property then the junior lien holder is without any redress as far as that particular piece of property is concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.510" offset="8545364">It is our position that this sale was made to satisfy a prior lien yet, but the lien of the United States as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.128" offset="8599907">The first sentence of the statutory section with which we are dealing says that, in the event of a foreclosure sale the effect of such sale shall discharge liens or encumbrances held by the United States just as it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.603" offset="8681827">Liens are encumbrances held by any other junior lien holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.714" offset="8702203">It's our position that if we read only that much of the statute the answer to our whole problem is obvious that the United States, by virtue of its nonappearance at the sale and its failure to bid at the sale, and the subsequent redemption by the landowner mortgagor has lost of its -- lost its interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.974" offset="8803244">That's the effect of Kansas law by the judicial sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.490" offset="8821321">Then the question is whether or not the United States could have appeared at the sale and bid had it chosen to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.951" offset="8859146">And it's our position that they most certainly could and it's in my understanding from what Mr. Doub had said that he admits that at the Farmers' Home Administration sought to appear at the sale and bid they could have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.823" offset="8914631">Well that is a means by which the Farmers' Home Administration could have protected its interest in this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.472" offset="8941275">The mortgage instrument itself provided that in the event of foreclosure sale the mortgagee, the FHA in this case could have appeared and bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.065" offset="8979623">Moreover 7 U.S.C. 1025 specifically applies to this situation that it -- it permits the Secretary of Agriculture to bid at a foreclosure sale in order that a loan made under any program administered by the Farmers' Home Administration can be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.478" offset="9065305">So that it seems to me that there is no question here that if the United States had sought to comply with the normal rules and procedures in the State of Kansas, it could have done so without any difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.350" offset="9116818">Why they didn't choose to do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.418" offset="9129044">We don't know, but it does seem to us that when the United States sought affirmative relief in the courts of Kansas they were obligated to comply with the rules and regulations and laws of the State of Kansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2336.779" offset="9450454">It -- it seems to me that the Court can decide the case without reaching a question such as they had posed, without reaching any constitutional issue and because the Court normally would avoid a constitutional issue with it to do so, it seems to be that the case can well be decided on these prior arguments as to the applicability of this right of redemption at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.792" offset="9550555">It seems to the appellees that the statute has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.628" offset="9573857">I think we -- in that regard should refer to the legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.624" offset="9597889">Mr. Doub has indicated that as he reads that legislative history it makes clear what the Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.663" offset="9625997">As we read the history, it's not at all clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.180" offset="9640103">This Court had an opportunity to review that history just last spring in the Brosnan opinion and as I read that opinion it was the determination of the Court that 2410 was passed because of all the difficulty that senior lien holders were having insofar as the existence of junior government lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.149" offset="9727979">Now it's true that certain protections were provided the United States perhaps certain conditions although as I've indicated I don't think that this right of redemption is one of those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.752" offset="9778343">Mr. Doub indicates in his oral argument that the history indicates that Congress well knew that there were states that had no right of redemption whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.500" offset="9821393">And it is our opinion that it was those states in which the Congress was concerned in order to be assured that United States would have some means of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.955" offset="9867160">Well the State of Kansas provides a means of protection to the United States by first requiring that it be made a party if its encumbrance is to be discharge as a result of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.183" offset="9916061">We're not going to be faced with any problem as Mr. Justice Clark suggested in his dissent in Brosnan that some morning the Government will wake up having lost its interest in the property without ever having any knowledge of the existence of any judicial or non-judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.449" offset="9981158">That can happen in Kansas, because before the lien can possibly be discharged the Government, the United States must be made a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.851" offset="10018774">Well, if they're made a party then they know what's happening, they know what the laws in the State of Kansas are, they know that if they want to be assured of protecting their interest in that property, the thing to do is appear on the courthouse steps when the property is sold and make their bid in an amount sufficient to protect their interest, although there was nothing in the world that kept the United States from doing that in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.958" offset="10191182">There were -- there were ample means for the United States to protect itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.042" offset="10211558">It seems to me that if the United States can loss its lien without a judicial sale when it has no knowledge of the fact that the sale is being held then it surely could loss its lien when it does have knowledge when it knows exactly what's going on when it knows what the procedure is to be followed when it has statutory authorization to follow that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.070" offset="10311659">Unfortunately again, I think for the United States they simply fail to follow that -- that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.453" offset="10361187">The legislative history of this section again seemed to me to indicate nothing more than that what the Congress was concerned with was to assure that United States some right of redemption in those states where a right is not otherwise it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.195" offset="10444152">Now Mr. Doub in his oral argument and in his reply brief has argued that when the Congress did not intend the right of redemption to acquire, it was very specific in saying so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.111" offset="10507786">He says that the Congress used an ambiguous language and he has referred to two specific statutes in his reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.558" offset="10553553">One of those statutes as I recall is 50 stat 706 now as amended 12 U.S.C. 640L.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.452" offset="10593155">I haven't had an opportunity since receipt of the reply brief to study that as thoroughly as I should like to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.422" offset="10629099">But I have read and reread and reread Section 640L A2 of 12 U.S.C. and the way I read it, it has no application in this matter at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.939" offset="10683120">It provides that Farm Credit Administration or the Federal Land Bank rather may acquire and dispose a property in the transaction of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.475" offset="10721259">And that laws which might otherwise be applicable are not applicable to the Federal Land Bank when it is concern with acquiring or disposing of property under that subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.792" offset="10770578">It doesn't have anything to do with loans so far as I can determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.787" offset="10790536">There surely is no unambiguous language in that section concerning the waiver of a right of redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.760" offset="10834422">There is no -- there is nothing concerning a right of redemption at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.074" offset="10847692">Now the Government relies on that statute for another purpose but we have suggested in our principle brief that from time to time the United States through one of its agencies has appeared in the courts of Kansas and has recognized the exclusive right of United States to redeem during the first 12 months following a foreclosure period or a foreclosure sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.015" offset="10947480">Now it happens that the two cases to which we make reference in our brief are both cases concerning the Federal Land Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.088" offset="10979767">And the Government argues that the Federal Land Bank by statute is excluded from relying on the benefits of the right of redemption in 2410 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.539" offset="11025533">Again, a careful reading of that statutory second indicates nothing about any right of redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.167" offset="11056044">Now I'm not prepared to say whether or not the Federal Land Bank by some other statute has in fact waived its right if it is a right to rely on the right of redemption in 2410 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.200" offset="11120201">At any rate it appears to me that the Government has in Kansas at least taken an inconsistent position in the past by recognizing the exclusive right of the defendant mortgagor to redeem during the first 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.117" offset="11203793">Again, this is not a case where the United States has no rights of redemption whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.896" offset="11230960">We have a fairly complex set of statutes regarding judicial foreclosure sale, mortgage foreclosures in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.173" offset="11272025">A junior lien holder has from the 12th to the 15th month to redeem in the event the defendant landowner has not previously exercised his right to redeem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.497" offset="11337331">It's for that reason that our State Supreme Court has time and again declared that the manner by which the defendant mortgagor protects himself as to appear at the sale and bid in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.924" offset="11399084">Now the United States says actually that the fact that the property sold for just the amount of the lien of the insurance company indicates that the sale was made solely for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.501" offset="11457390">I don't think it so indicates at all it merely indicates that nobody else appeared who is sufficiently interested in that piece of property to bid any larger sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.175" offset="11496051">The fact that it only brought enough to -- to pay off the person in does not showed that the sale was made solely to satisfy that lien, has already been indicated from the judgment of the District Court as shown in the record, the sale was made to satisfy more than just the lien of the first mortgagee it was made to satisfy the lien from United States as well.</text>
