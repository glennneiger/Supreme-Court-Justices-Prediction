            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">William H. Burton, appellant versus Wilmington Parking Authority, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.382" offset="126997">Mr. Solicitor General, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="9.770" stopTime="247.079">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="9.770" offset="144551">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="11.701" offset="152179">Towards the close of the argument on Tuesday, I was beginning to develop those points of state participation or contact which lead us to the conclusion that it is fair to describe this case as one in which the State is operating a single, self-sustaining governmental unit in which the petitioners were denied equality of treatment, and which therefore violated the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.577" offset="267745">I mentioned as the first of those factors, the circumstance that this is state-owned land, that the State retains a connection with it as lessor, and indeed we think that that would be ground enough to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.197" offset="334200">The second significant circumstance is that these leased premises are physically an integral part of the building which is currently operated by the State and currently used by the State for a governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.714" offset="408283">This circumstance seems to me to distinguish all those cases where you have an isolated piece of property which the State may own and lease, and then ceases to have any contact with.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.406" offset="455095">Now I'd like to take a minute to describe in somewhat more detail, since the court below said it could take judicial notice of this building, just what the physical arrangements are.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.878" offset="496891">The parking facility is a building.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.705" offset="512251">It occupies all of one block on the street which it fronts principally, and it reaches back a good two-thirds of the normal block on each of the two streets running at right angles.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.321" offset="570661">On the front, it apparently is about three stories high, and the ground, I think, slopes down behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.647" offset="600022">So there are about three stories and a roof available for parking.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.110" offset="621861">On the front of the building, the upper portion is vertical with the street; that is, it reaches right out to the travel portion of the street and the stores which are along the front, with the coffee shop right in the middle, are recessed back in, so as to form sort of an arcade over the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.789" offset="716528">At either end of this arcade, anyone walking along the sidewalk to get to the coffee shop would see immediately over him, on the upper part of the building, "Wilmington Parking Authority," thus emphasizing that the whole building was a state building and this is true at either end.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.250" offset="794373">Then on the front of the building, directly over the coffee shop appears, "Mid-Town Parking Center," identifying this facility and separating it out from what I understand are some other parking lots owned by the Wilmington Parking Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.116" offset="861874">On the front of the building, on the roof over the coffee shop, are two flagpoles, which on the ordinary days of the week fly the United States flag and the flag of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.106" offset="933867">I emphasize these points for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.092" offset="945779">In the first place, it does seem to me to underscore the integrity, the unity, of this building, and therefore of all the activities which take place in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.498" offset="995412">And second, it seems to me that it makes very plain a point which I mentioned Tuesday, towards anyone who was the victim of discrimination in this coffee shop could not escape the fact that the discrimination took place in a public building and literally, here, under the flag of the United States and of Delaware, and I think that --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="247.079" stopTime="247.881">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="247.079" offset="1093736">I didn't meant to interrupt you –</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="247.881" stopTime="253.470">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="247.881" offset="1096976">-- I just wanted to say I thought that distinguished this case from many others which might be put.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="253.470" stopTime="266.196">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="253.470" offset="1119336">The question I wanted to ask you was, is the restaurant itself, either on its menus or its advertising literature, carry any notation that it's identified in any way with the Delaware --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="266.196" stopTime="352.452">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="266.196" offset="1170223">None that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.332" offset="1174716">It would be identified only by the physical appearance, but I think -- I do want to say, I think anyone who saw this would realize, as I certainly did when I went to see it, that this was truly part of one building, and that, while the architecture is quite different, it was in a public building, almost as obviously as in the restaurant facilities in this Court or in another courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.938" offset="1301149">The third point to emphasize is that, just as the building is structurally a unit, so is the entire enterprise bound up financially into a single project.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.236" offset="1350363">The Supreme Court of Delaware, when it sustained the constitutionality of this statute against the charge that this was leasing for a private commercial purpose, and therefore not within the power of the State, ruled that the leases could be permitted only to the extent that such leasing is necessary and feasible to enable the Authority to finance the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.263" offset="1442523">In other words, this isn't separate or surplus or extra property, of the kind of property mentioned in Derrington and Plumber.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.295" offset="1478572">This property is essential to the conduct of this state enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.815" offset="1504695">The fourth thing that I would call to your attention --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="352.452" stopTime="390.785">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="352.452" offset="1515248">Well, may I ask you -- may I break in?</text>
            <text syncTime="355.766" offset="1528519">That third fact would apply to every leasing because whether the State leases in order to derive money from the leasing or part of the money for maintaining the state enterprise, or whether it's to go into the fisc of the State, into the treasury generally, or whether any deficit is to be covered by taxation or unidentified state funds for purposes of the State Constitution, it seems to be immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.291" offset="1654533">That's merely a choice of how the State does the financing, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="390.785" stopTime="394.240">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="390.785" offset="1668535">That isn't the view that the Supreme Court of Delaware took of it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="394.240" stopTime="411.797">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="394.240" offset="1682432">I understand that, but isn't that true, as a matter of -- as a significant factor, that it's merely an expression or a formulation or an exercise of a financial choice by the State in financing the enterprise.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="411.797" stopTime="445.722">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="411.797" offset="1752649">It's an exercise of financial choice, and I think that I might well be making the same contention, but the fact that this is bound together and is viewed, whereas this would not have been permitted by Delaware had it been leasing of a separate property just to get revenues, whereas it was regarded that it'd be essentially by the State, that it be an essential part of one single enterprise, does seem to me to be another circumstance, perhaps not an essential one, binding it all into a unit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="445.722" stopTime="461.785">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="445.722" offset="1888277">You're not foreclosing, or you don't you want the Court to foreclose, assuming they're with you on these confirming or strengthening items, they're not confirming that any lease of state property is a mode by which the State exercises its power?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="461.785" stopTime="514.611">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="461.785" offset="1952538">No, quite the contrary and perhaps I should say now something that applies not only to this point, but to a number of distinctions that I shall draw, that I think in this field it is important to consider how this case relates to others that it suggests, and that the Court might wish to satisfy itself that there were administrable and rational distinctions between this case and, for example, Justice Harlan's suggestion that this might have been leased for a private park, in all those cases, I think it s important for us to put them to one side.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.073" offset="2097674">It's equally important not to prejudge them.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.916" offset="2109064">In this field under the Fourteenth Amendment, we really can't foretell it's complete application, or even entirely know our own meanings, until experience and time have given us a greater insight.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="514.611" stopTime="526.948">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="514.611" offset="2163816">The implicit starting point, the implicit premise of your argument I take it is that this is precisely a field where case-by-case unfolding becomes not only relevant but essential?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="526.948" stopTime="594.692">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="526.948" offset="2213240">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.515" offset="2227451">Three other points deserve somewhat brief mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.528" offset="2243542">The first is that this property was acquired by a state agency with the power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.143" offset="2278024">It in fact was all negotiated private sale, but the agency did have the power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.445" offset="2307176">And it seems o me that that fact, taken with the financial necessity for these leases, goes far to destroy the argument that's presented here by he appellees to the effect that this is extra property or surplus property.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.244" offset="2378439">Indeed, the Supreme Court of Delaware, in passing upon the constitutionality of this statute, said of these leases, or one of these leases, “Clearly it does not fall within the scope of the rule permitting temporary commercial leasing of public facilities not immediately needed for public purposes” and then went on and said that this, all of this property, was being used for public purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="594.692" stopTime="607.118">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="594.692" offset="2484182">Mr. Solicitor General, supposing this space had been sold, although physically remaining in the same way in which you have described it, instead of leased, would that make any difference in your opinion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="607.118" stopTime="656.333">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="607.118" offset="2533919">I think we'd have a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.608" offset="2551892">What I said to Justice Frankfurter I think would be pertinent here, but in the law the lessor has long been regarded, as the Court knows, as having a continuing relation to the property that he leases, and certain responsibilities in connection with property that he leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.801" offset="2624616">And therefore I would distinguish this case from all those cases in which there is, if I may be colloquial, a one-shot proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.769" offset="2656486">The State sells the land, the State grants a subsidy, or disposes of the chattel.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.136" offset="2693998">Here there is, through this relation of lessor and lessee, a continuing tie, which fits in with these other bonds that I've mentioned.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="656.333" stopTime="660.534">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="656.333" offset="2730778">Of course, you are going to say you would have the same continuing -- these same factors that you emphasize —</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="660.534" stopTime="694.729">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="660.534" offset="2747601">You'd have the same physical tie, but you'd have a relationship that the law had long regarded differently and it might be thought that physical tie was not enough to impose the obligation whereas the relationship of the lessor, who had convented to keep part of this premises in repair is one which frequently carried affirmative duties in relation to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.812" offset="2848643">So I would say that was another of these cases which can be logically distinguished in that we shouldn't undertake to decide them now because they are different case.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.321" offset="3358657">In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that this is a view of the project, curiously, which the Supreme Court of Delaware took when it was passing upon the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.707" offset="3408290">The challenge to the statute was very similar to the argument which is made here, to wit, that these would be private commercial leases and not a state activity and the argument that was made was that the State can't go into the business of leasing its property for private commercial purposes because this would enable it to go into every kind of private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.295" offset="3510585">The Supreme Court of Delaware rejected that argument, using the phrase that I have quoted so often, to wit, that this was not simply an ordinary commercial leasing, but that it was a single self-sustaining governmental unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.929" offset="3577145">And one of the questions that was put to the court was whether it was proper to grant a tax exemption, or to give this Authority the power of eminent domain, and the court answered that question saying, “Since we have held the purpose of the project as a whole to be a public one, the answer must be in the affirmative.”</text>

            <text syncTime="911.707" offset="3752270">In conclusion, I would like to emphasize two observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.799" offset="3776616">The first is that when the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment sought to assure equality for all men in relation to the State, they plainly meant a State in all its activities and all its aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.638" offset="3839937">Similarly this Court has never been grudging in its interpretation of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.732" offset="3864388">It's not strained, as I read the decisions, for fine distinctions concerning the degree of state involvement necessary to call forth the guarantee of racial equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.820" offset="3908692">Quite the contrary, it has struck down every form of discrimination that affected a man in his relation to his government, every form of discrimination between the citizen and his government.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.062" offset="3973684">Since there was unquestionably such a relation here, since this project was one, and a project where the petitioners when they requested service in this restaurant, could not help knowing that they were on the property of the State, we submit that the Fourteenth Amendment is called into play, and that the judgment below should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.175" offset="4154138">It seems to me that the central fact here is that this is a restaurant open to the general public, for which the proprietor has shown no interest in the selection of his customers except for this bit of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.883" offset="4224982">That kind of case seems to me to stand at one end of a rather broad range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.247" offset="4246403">At the other end would go a lease for an apartment or a social club, possibly a lawyer's office or a doctor's office, of state property in this building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.156" offset="4294050">In those situations, clearly there must be taken into account the interest in the private choice of friends, associates, possibly of his clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.797" offset="4348594">Now, the restaurant is a place of public accommodation, in the Nineteenth Century language of William Sumner and others, I'm not quite clear whether the jewelry store or the bookstore belongs in the first category or in the same category as a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.431" offset="4427170">It seems to me that in most of our eyes a restaurant has a somewhat different characteristic from other shops and we must also recognize that there are certainly some stores which do make a choice among customers on non-invidious grounds.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clair John Killoran</label>
            <text syncTime="1142.112" offset="4673870">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.397" offset="4687036">The Wilmington Parking Authority, the appellee that I represent, respectfully submit that there's only one question in this case, that is on the merits and that is whether the action or the conduct of Eagle can fairly be said to be the conduct of the Authority, and thus state action inhibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.882" offset="4784943">As we know, the courts have held on numerous occasions that private acts of discrimination are not as such illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.930" offset="4821096">When, however, governmental discrimination as opposed to private discrimination is charged, it then becomes the duty of the court to examine the facts, and if the facts support the charge, to prevent the discrimination and, of course, the Authority subscribes to those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.585" offset="4891732">The cases cited by all the parties in this case are rested on various grounds, but I think it is generally agreed that general definitions of state action are not apt in all factual contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.262" offset="4962471">Therefore, it would seem appropriate that we examine the pertinent facts, the real facts in this case, to see if those facts support the charge made by Mr. Burton, the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.263" offset="5006461">After the Wilmington Parking Authority acquired the land at Ninth and Shipley Streets in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, on which the subject facility and subject restaurant are located, it retained experts to advise it on what type of structure should be erected to accommodate parking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.495" offset="5099353">The Authority was advised that the streets in this area would only accommodate a certain given number of motor vehicles, and that a multi-level masonry building should be constructed to accommodate that number of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.801" offset="5164659">The financial forecasts were prepared, and on the basis of those forecasts the underwriters concluded that the parking facility as planned could not be financed from parking revenue alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.786" offset="5220561">So then the Authority elected to exercise a right granted to it under the Enabling Act and provide space for commercial leasing in addition to the parking space that was required and recommended by the consulting engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.176" offset="5290151">The parking space itself was not curtailed or diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.468" offset="5307288">The building was redesigned to provide for additional space which would be commercial space.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.349" offset="5338843">With the anticipated revenue from rentals as well as the parking revenues, the underwriters purchased the bonds in the aggregate amount of 2.5 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.777" offset="5400492">Even though the City of Wilmington paid all the consideration for the land, the facility itself was constructed from the proceeds of the revenue bonds, with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.794" offset="5464545">In respect to the commercial space, only roofs and walls and basements were constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.300" offset="5490667">In all the commercial space the tenants had to construct their own facilities, own finishings, own furnishings, own decorations, own air conditioning, at their own cost, without any right of reimbursement from the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.303" offset="5558585">We advertised for public bids for commercial space, and prior to the closing date for the bids a Mr. Rankin, a taxpayer of the City of Wilmington, threatened to attempt to enjoin the Authority from entering the field of private enterprise by leasing commercial space.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.968" offset="5641341">The Authority immediately filed a declaratory judgment action in our Court of Chancery, and under a provision of our State Constitution it was certified directly to our Supreme Court, which is our court of last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.978" offset="5697348">The Supreme Court sustained the right of the Authority to lease commercial space, to the extent but only to the extent that it was necessary and feasible to help finance the contemplated project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.514" offset="5755444">Now the Supreme Court ruled that we did not comply with the requirements of competitive bidding and that we had to request bids again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.599" offset="5791807">Now, after the Rankin case, the Enabling Act was amended in order to permit the Authority to negotiate the leases if after requests for competitive bids were made and none received, or if received, if rejected by the Authority, then the Authority could negotiate leases for this commercial space.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.550" offset="5887624">After we requested competitive bids and none were received, over a period of time, and a substantial period of time, we finally negotiated four leases for the commercial space, one such being that of Eagle which is being discussed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.063" offset="5949691">The Eagle lease appears in the record beginning on page 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.810" offset="5968708">And if you'll examine the lease you will note, few minor items, with the exception of a few minor items that the Authority is to provide, Eagle at its own sole cost expense is responsible for constructing a restaurant, all finishings, all decorations, all fixtures, all air conditioning and Eagle retained its own architect, its own engineers, its own contractors, and paid for the construction of the facility out of its own funds without right of any reimbursement from the City, State, or the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.010" offset="6113426">It's submitted, Your Honors, that the Authority in reality leased four unfinished masonry walls, an unfinished roof, an unfinished floor, and basement to Eagle, and Eagle constructed a restaurant, bars, cocktail lounges, and banquet rooms in and on the property of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.143" offset="6202034">Now, Mr. Cox has mentioned about our signs --</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.550" offset="6323660">It has no control over the restaurant as such and its operations, its policies or whatnot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.767" offset="6380502">Yes, it does have that control, Chief Justice, because in negotiating leases we couldn't have negotiated successfully with Eagle if we're going to have another restaurant right next to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.198" offset="6434210">So in the lease itself, it restricts the use to the restaurant purposes, including bars and banquet rooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.088" offset="6465766">The lease so provides and provides they can only use it for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.697" offset="6488231">Now, when this restaurant was completed, the construction of it was completed, it was not provided, nor is there provided today any public entrance from the parking facility itself to the restaurant, or as a matter of fact, to any of the tenants are there public entrances from the parking facility to the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.775" offset="6568479">The pubic entrance to the Eagle is on the street level on Ninth Street, and you enter directly into Eagle, and on the first floor level it has three large beautiful dining rooms, with a bar and cocktail lounge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.084" offset="6629710">You go to the basement level, it has banquet rooms and accommodations for upwards of 300 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.433" offset="6655101">I bring this out at this time with the purpose of attempting to illustrate that it was not the intent of the Parking Authority to provide service for the benefit of the patrons of the Authority It had only one sole purpose, as expressed in the Enabling Act itself to obtain revenues, rental income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.483" offset="8783350">Eagle spent over 240,000 dollars on this restaurant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.108" offset="8817831">Eagle was not invited there; it's a happenstance it's there, but when it did negotiate this lease, there was no thought or no intent on the part of either party that it should serve a public purpose, namely, serve the patrons of the Authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.653" offset="11392042">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.893" offset="11413044">In order to present the legal argument for the Eagle, it is necessary that I implement and restate certain facts which have already been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.022" offset="11453482">These facts are essential to my legal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.700" offset="11468215">The Eagle was incorporated in 1934 and has conducted a restaurant business in the City of Wilmington, with the exception of few months, since that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.743" offset="11508443">Now, the statute creating the Parking Authority provides power to lease a space in the facility, or spaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.016" offset="11545433">The leases under such provision fall into, and under the statutory provisions, fall into two categories, where the lessee may carry on the sale of gasoline and accessories, and provide service to motorists, that's the first category, as the statute sets it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.269" offset="11610530">Now, the second is where the lease may be for any commercial use and where the leasing is necessary and feasible for financing the operation of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.846" offset="11656819">The statute provides for public notice, for invitations to bid for leasing space.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.827" offset="11676776">Neither the legislative act nor the notice for the bids say anything as to what use is to be made of the space leased; nor is it stated anywhere in the statute or the bidding proposal procedure that the space was to be leased primarily to serve patrons of the parking facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.379" offset="11766951">As was stated, it's by mere chance that the space was awarded to a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.227" offset="11786282">It could have been awarded to any other type of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.552" offset="11799656">And at no time, either in the legislative history or bidding or negotiating procedure was it stated that the Authority would provide a restaurant for the parking facility patrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.131" offset="11849916">The Eagle lease, as well as the leases of its neighbors, a bookshop, a camera shop, a retail food store, and a jewelry store fall into this category; that is, the second category of commercial leasing as provided for in this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.925" offset="11913132">The main and only public entrance to the Eagle and these stores is on the street on which these lessees front.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.530" offset="11947510">There are, as the law provides, fire exits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.006" offset="11961407">Now the street on which these stores front, is basically a street, where shops -- where business of a retail nature is carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.043" offset="12005606">The other two streets that are referred to by Mr. Cox are basically streets with the rear of buildings fronting on another main street, where they have other retail business shops and I pointed that out so that the Court would have that picture, that these are ordinary commercial businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.879" offset="12096930">The Eagle was awarded the space it occupied because it submitted a successful proposal and negotiated for the space.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.102" offset="12129844">The public advertisement for the bid and the negotiations for this space put no restrictions upon the Eagle as to the patrons it would serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.917" offset="12169132">The Authority granted the Eagle a lease for twenty years, and this lease, as well as all other documents, puts no restriction on the Eagle as to what patrons it will serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.377" offset="12210928">The Authority at no time has made a statement of policy in this respect, nor has it attempted to dictate Eagle's policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.019" offset="12245514">As was stated, the Eagle through its own capital furnished substantially all of the furnishings and fixtures, including the air conditioning, to enable it to carry on the business of a restaurant, cocktail lounge, and banquet rooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.834" offset="12296714">In other words, the Eagle leased floor space and bare walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.904" offset="12325031">Now, considering these facts, it is my opinion that the legal issue is, whether the Eagle as a lessee of the Parking Authority, performing a function not related to the parking services of the facility, has violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.855" offset="12400891">Our position is that it has not been -- that there has not been a violation and in sustaining our position, we submit a two-fold approach which is in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.183" offset="12454181">One, there was no state action in this case because Eagle's function as a restaurant, which is unrelated to the function of the Parking Authority, excludes it from the concept of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.599" offset="12503813">Two, if it is established that there was state action in this case, then there is no violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because of the particular factual situation, because of the particular factual situation of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.722" offset="12572359">Now, as to the first proposition, we submit that there is no integral relationship between the activities of Eagle and activities of the Parking Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.723" offset="12612274">The respondent Eagle contends that the best method to determine whether or not a lessee of a state agency is part of state action is to analyze the functions of the state lessor and its private lessee and in this particular phase of the case, legal argument, developing what may be considered the functional answer in reply to the statements made by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.319" offset="12710703">The statute creating the Authority states that the purpose of the Authority is to provide off-street parking for the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.876" offset="12740901">This legislative act further provides that the Authority may enter into a lease when the lessee may carry on the sale of gasoline, motor accessories, and services and again, let me say that this particular service would be part of the function of the Parking Authority, but there is no provision which directed the Authority to provide for any other particular service for its parking patrons, and there is nothing which states that it would provide a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.346" offset="12866811">As already indicated, it happens that Eagle occupies a space in the facility not because it serves food but because it was a successful bidder for that space.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.925" offset="12913100">The area where the Eagle located is a prime area for a restaurant business, which was the situation there before the Parking Authority facility was constructed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.118" offset="12997841">There is no public entrance from the parking area to the businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.112" offset="13013828">The bidding and negotiations, of course, put no restrictions on the Eagle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.242" offset="13034412">It was a bona fide landlord-tenant relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.150" offset="13049981">The lease contains no provision whereby the Authority would be able to control the policies of the Eagle as to what patrons will or will not be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.084" offset="13085717">Nor does the record show that there was any subterfuge in the execution of this lease to control the Eagle's customer policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.380" offset="13122915">There were no collusive practices here in order to carry on discriminatory activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.078" offset="13149769">In the Wilmington area there is an atmosphere of racial tolerance and the motives of the Authority and the Eagle were to enter into a straight landlord and tenant relationship without any attempt to circumvent the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.329" offset="13214762">It is our position that the mere fact that rental income from the Eagle is necessary to finance the parking facility is not sufficient to bring a lessee within the sphere of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.296" offset="13266589">To say that it is a controlling factor is to blow up that fact beyond its true proportions and in my opinion, to torture a landlord-tenant relationship into a possible principal-agent relationship when the principal is an instrumentality of the State, by making; the tenant an agent because the rental income there from is necessary for the landlord's continuance, is an arbitrary breakdown of legal relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.945" offset="13393230">In the Derrington case there was a bona fide lease, but the function of the lessee was to cater to the patrons of the courthouse and that part of the courthouse which the restaurant occupied was planned, equipped, and furnished by the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.673" offset="13460104">The space that the Eagle occupies in this facility was neither planned equipped or furnished by the Parking Authority as a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.282" offset="13494585">To state that rental income alone is the determining factor will lead to the clear conclusion that every necessary business transaction between the State and any private business which furnishes income or service to the State would immediately bring the private business involved within the scope of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.858" offset="13572848">Let me take several examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.291" offset="13582566">Suppose that a CPA firm is called upon to audit the accounts of the Parking Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.433" offset="13615167">This CPA firm comes on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.415" offset="13631049">It begins its audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.534" offset="13639513">It's a known fact that it's auditing the books and this firm has a record of discrimination, engaging in racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.256" offset="13674412">Now, obviously its participating, it's providing services to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.960" offset="13701266">Is the Court going to say that this state action theory will reach out and say to that auditing firm, you are engaged in the discriminatory practices, you cannot carry on this work on the parking facility?</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.701" offset="13764274">Now let's take for example, suppose that they have a breakdown in the plumbing system and the plumber comes along and he puts up his sign that he's doing the plumbing work there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.375" offset="13802935">He is rendering services to the State and they find that the plumber was engaged in discriminatory practices, is the arm of the State to reach out and say, no you can't do this work with the Parking Authority because you engage in discriminatory practices?</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.084" offset="13889766">In other words, what I am saying is that to rest this case on rental income is to lead to such absurdities as I just indicated and furthermore, suppose you had an instrumentality of the State which took some funds put it in a certificate of deposit in a bank, and drew income, interest income from that, is that very fact alone to say, well, this now makes that bank –</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.444" offset="15139150">Now, we look at the function of the Eagle in this situation and ask ourselves, what is the function of the lessee in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.541" offset="15171542">The function of the lessee is to serve the general public, not just merely the patrons of the Parking Authority, but to serve the general public.</text>

            <text syncTime="3814.870" offset="15364848">Then I took, was there any evidence of subterfuge in order to evade the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.321" offset="15390657">And the third thing, is the lessee an integral part of the functions of the governmental lessor and fourth - Is there any statutory or administrative control of the lessee?</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.663" offset="15444052">And when I applied these standards to this situation, it was my opinion that the Eagle should not be brought within the orbit of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.093" offset="15489818">Now, if you take this case and the Boynton case, you'll see very well that it was rightly brought within the sphere of state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="4014.470" offset="16163255">Then you had a matter of a private business and I state that it is difficult for me to really -- to challenge the holding, in one respect, but by the same time and I cite in my brief the Girard Trust Company case to show you that, in examining this whole principle of the matter of the exertion of state power, you've got to look at all aspects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.537" offset="16275581">With that principle in mind, let us review the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.616" offset="16287911">Usually the state action has been broadly and generally defined as an exertion of state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.278" offset="16314556">This definition has been paraphrased to mean a touch of the government's thumb on the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.765" offset="16344440">Now, I develop from that to Berman versus Parker, in which the Court held that private property could be taken and then resold for a public purpose to private individuals and that's the starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.763" offset="16396476">Now, in the Dorsey case, which was a situation where the property was taken by a governmental agency, resold to a private developer who practiced a discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.202" offset="16466275">Now, these are designated as the blighted area cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.092" offset="16481740">Now, they certainly indicate the power of the government was used to acquire a blighted area, clear the site, and then negotiate a resale of the land to private redevelopers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.794" offset="16520610">In this process of governmental action, it no doubt happened that the homes of Negroes were taken, as in the Dorsey case, which was a discrimination against Negroes by private developers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.986" offset="16577348">Yet, the Court was not concerned with violations of the Fourteenth Amendment when it was obvious that, in the Berman and Dorsey cases, there was an exertion of state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.439" offset="16619144">Now, in the Derrington, the Derrington and Ashwander cases, now the Derrington case, of course, is the courthouse space where the space in the courthouse was leased, and the Ashwander case was where the Supreme Court upheld the right of the TVA to sell surplus electricity or to lease surplus electricity to private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.654" offset="16716006">Now, these cases are labeled by us as the surplus property cases in our brief, and in developing this, I say that I am not drawing a direct analogy between the surplus cases or do I want to be taken as to say that this extra space that was set up in the Eagle for business purposes is to be considered surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.934" offset="16805136">I'm only trying to show to what extent the exertion of state power has gone without being considered as being violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.497" offset="16855395">These cases indicate that once surplus property is leased, the lessee is free to deal with its property almost without any possibility of being charged with a Fourteenth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.055" offset="16905655">And I argue by analogy that here we have a private lessee now in charge of the space that has been leased to it by the lessor, the governmental lessor, it is now in the category of a private lessee and has the right to enjoy all the privileges of a private lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.925" offset="16997083">Just to show you to what extent, in trying to determine the boundaries of what is meant by an exertion of state power, look at the licensing cases, where there has obviously been an exertion of state power in granting an individual the right to carry on a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.072" offset="17065733">And in many instances the licensing may be in a discriminatory practice -- the licensee may engage in discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.963" offset="17101260">For example, we have a theater in Wilmington called the Ri-llto Theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.991" offset="17117351">Now, the State granted to that theater the license to carry on a theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.023" offset="17141488">It censors the films that go on in that -- are carried on in that theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.828" offset="17164685">Obviously, in my opinion that s an exertion of state power and yet, that theater engages in discnminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.053" offset="17205645">So I state that -- also I've now covered the Girard Trust use, but I would like to restate that certainly the acts of the Orphan s Court in removing the public trustees and substituting private trustees was an exercise of governmental power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.997" offset="17285371">And yet, that act, or that substitution was not considered violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis L. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="5779.833" offset="23224780">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.080" offset="23241707">I would briefly like to summarize the position of the appellant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5790.887" offset="23268979">However, before I do that I hope the Court will permit me to make one digression which is not in the record, and I would assume to do that only because there have been a number of references made to facts which are not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.334" offset="23338778">Your Honor, the Chief Justice presumed a hypothetical case in which the land on which the facility is now erected had been occupied by disadvantaged members of a minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.314" offset="23406696">This was not the situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.317" offset="23422683">This land was extremely valuable land in the center city which was then used for a commercial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.640" offset="23475973">So that the plaintiff here was not disadvantaged in that manner, but the fact outside the record I'd like to mention is the fact that the plaintiff is a member of the City Council of the City of Wilmington, Delaware, a fact which is well known to all the parties in this matter, and was well known to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.874" offset="23576910">Now, I mention that not as giving him any rights superior to the rights of any members of the class whom he represents, but as indicating that as a member of City Council, which under the statute which creates this Authority, has the right to confirm persons appointed to the Authority, he did have intimate knowledge of the operation of this parking facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.283" offset="23706582">He brought his action merely as a member of the minority group, and the basis of his claim was that this was state property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.842" offset="23760812">Now, we've set forth in our brief all of the indicia of state property which associate with this particular facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.933" offset="23797175">The most important aspect of the relationship of the lessee to the lessor here is that the legislature prohibits leasing except insofar as leasing is necessary to carry out a governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.148" offset="23870004">To that extent, the lessee is an instrumentality of the public lessor for the purpose of carrying out a public function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5950.565" offset="23907725">And it is the position of the appellant here that this instrumentality of the public lessor should be affected by the same constitutional restraints that the public lessor is.</text>

            <text syncTime="5990.178" offset="24066132">Now, may I say – may I go -- however, that is one aspect, that is the fact that this is a public property, was the fact that brought him was the legal basis, that brought him in the court originally, After he got into the Court of chancery, he was furnished a second legal basis to oppose this discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.205" offset="24154216">The defendants defended on the basis of a state statute, and they said that this state statute gave them the right to discriminate against this individual because of his association with the particular ethnic minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.925" offset="24233106">Now, this was state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.739" offset="24252332">That is, the interpretation by the court that this meaning which the defendants ascribed to the statute was a valid meaning, made the statute mean exactly what the defendants said it meant and so by state judicial action giving legal force and effect to a racially discriminatory statute, the defendant brings his appeal, and he bases his appeal on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.299" offset="24386602">And we ask the Court not only to declare that there is state action here because of the fact that the private lessee is an instrumentality of the public lessor in effectuating the public purpose, but also because here is a statute of the State of Delaware which the highest court of the State of Delaware says may be used to discriminate against people because of an extraneous fact like their ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.860" offset="24528812">And we say that time after time this Court has held that this is a violation of the Equal Protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="6114.445" offset="24563190">So for these -- on these two grounds, not only is the defendant in court, but on these two grounds it is our belief that the judgment below should be reversed and we respectfully request such a reversal.</text>
