            <label>Mr. Raymond K. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="26.926" offset="211048">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.209" offset="228185">This litigation represents a quest for equal treatment in the matter of freight rates, equal treatment for shippers who use the Milwaukee Railroad between Spokane and the Twin Cities, the same as received by shippers who use the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.247" offset="312404">It also represents a quest for equal treatment to the Milwaukee Road, the same as is given to the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific in the way of joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.581" offset="357648">The Milwaukee Railroad operates from Chicago and Indiana on the east by way of Milwaukee, the Twin Cities, Spokane to Seattle and Tacoma in the Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.055" offset="411564">The S. P. &amp; S. system is composed of the Spokane Portland in Seattle Railway, the Oregon Electric Railway, the Oregon Trunk Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.269" offset="448449">It operates from Spokane on the east to Vancouver Washington, Portland, Oregon and other points in Southern Washington and in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.509" offset="497455">It is owned jointly by the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.371" offset="520861">Great Northern operates from the Twin Cities on the east to the Pacific Northwest by way of Spokane including Seattle, Tacoma, Portland and other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.263" offset="572374">The Northern Pacific operates partly north and partly south of the Milwaukee's route from the Twin Cities by way of Spokane to Seattle, Tacoma and Portland and other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.945" offset="631202">At Spokane, Washington, the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific have a complete line of joint rates with the S. P. &amp; S. system.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.922" offset="679058">Now, the essential feature of a joint rate is that two railroads have agreed to transport merchandise or traffic from a point on one railroad to a point on another at a combined charge lower than the sum of their two local rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.709" offset="762232">On the other end, the S. P. &amp; S. system will enter into only a limited line of joint rates with the Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.241" offset="800371">On the other traffic which could be interchanged at Spokane, combination rates would apply which because they are higher than the joint rates applicable if the traffic moves over the Northern Pacific or the Great Northern effectively would prevent any large amount or any fair amount of traffic to move by the Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.757" offset="898382">Now, a combination rate, of course, is the sum of the local rate or one carrier to the junction point was the rate of the other carrier from the junction point to destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.680" offset="942059">As a result of this refusal by the S. P. &amp; S. system to enter into a complete line of joint rates with the Milwaukee, the Milwaukee is short hold on 92% of the S. P. &amp; S. system traffic, which it is now endowing at a lost and revenue to the Milwaukee of over $2.5 million per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.469" offset="1037249">Now, that works this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.776" offset="1042474">The Milwaukee, if it has traffic going to the S. P. &amp; S. system originating in the midwest or in the east or in the south can take it as far as the Twin Cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.550" offset="1085524">And there is compelled to surrender the traffic to either the Great Northern or the Northern Pacific who then take under Spokane and give it to the S. P. &amp; S. system.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.613" offset="1125857">In coming the other way, the Milwaukee is not permitted to solicit the traffic at Spokane at joint rates but must wait until the traffic reaches the Twin Cities in order to participate in the hall at the joint rates, which are sought in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.812" offset="1194611">Now, this deprives the shippers the use of the Milwaukee's route between Spokane and the Twin Cities except for the rate penalty in many shipments and it does deprive the Milwaukee with its right to solicit this traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.156" offset="1244035">Accordingly back in 1954, the Milwaukee filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission and it charged that the S. P. &amp; S. system was in violation of Section 1 (4), which requires that every common carrier subject to the Act to establish reasonable through routes with other such carriers and just and reasonable rates, charges and so forth applicable thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.716" offset="1330239">It also charged the S. P. &amp; S. with the violation of Section 3 (1) of the Act and it shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make, give or cause any undo or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, locality, or to subject any particular person, firm, locality and so forth to any undo or unreasonable precedence or advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.888" offset="1414875">It charged the S. P. &amp; S. with a violation of Section 3 for the interstate commerce that requires that all carriers shall not discriminate in their rates, fares and charges between connecting lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.515" offset="1461478">The Milwaukee and both the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 15 (1) of the Interstate Commerce Act which gives the Commission the power and the duty to correct violations of the Act and invoked the power of the Commission under Section 15 (3), which requires the Commission when it finds it desirable and the public interest to establish through routes and joint rates applicable thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.177" offset="1572028">As soon as the complaint was filed, the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern promptly intervened and claimed that under Section 15 (4), the Interstate Commerce Act, the Commission cannot require through routes by any carrier or in connection with any carrier which requires that railroad without its consent to embrace in such routes substantially less than the entire length of its railroad and of any intermediate railroad operated in conjunction and under a common management or control therewith which lies between the termini of the proposed through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.976" offset="1711313">And the Great Northern said, We are under common management or control with the S. P. &amp; S. system and are entitled to the protection of the long-haul over our line as well as over the S. P. &amp; S. system.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.512" offset="1757393">And the Northern Pacific filed their petition for intervention and they said, Well, we are entitled to the protection of 15 (4) because we are under common management or control with the S. P. &amp; S. system, and they both then asserted the same claim each claiming to be under common management or control with the S. P. &amp; S. system.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.632" offset="1833880">And the S. P. &amp; S. system resolved that if I move by answering that they were under common management or control with both the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.976" offset="1867316">So the Milwaukee denied the affirmative allegations of common management or control and put the defendants and their intervenors upon proof with respect thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.312" offset="1908590">At the hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States intervened on behalf of the Milwaukee along with the Western Forest Industries and National Livestock Producers Association, the American National Cattlemen's Association, the National Wool Growers Association and the Chicago Producers Commission Association representing thousands of livestock, growers, cattlemen, wool growers and livestock producers in the western states, also appearing in behalf of the railroad as an intervenor.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.014" offset="2035440">In behalf of the Milwaukee was the Traffic Bureau of Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Association of Shippers and Receivers of great at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.002" offset="2075355">The Milwaukee had to name about 300 railroads as defendants in order that there would be no question of the Commission's jurisdiction to prescribe joint rates and through routes in this case if through routes were necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.280" offset="2128541">Out of these 300 railroads only five, the Chicago Burlington in Quincy which is a subsidiary of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific and the Northwestern and the Minneapolis in St. Louis which is now one railroad and the Chicago Rock Island in Pacific opposed the granting of the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.618" offset="2201893">Intervenors on behalf of the great Northern, Northern Pacific and S. P. &amp; S. consisted of some labor groups of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.794" offset="2238568">Hearings were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.403" offset="2244942">Many railroad witnesses testified and many shipper witnesses testified on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.270" offset="2264482">And two years later in 1956, the examiner issued a proposed report finding that the S. P. &amp; S. system is under common management or control with each of the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.373" offset="2312861">His proposed report found that there are no through routes presently existing except for a joint rates supply and found that, however, the present rates on lumber and fresh fruits, and vegetables and livestock moving from points on the S. P. &amp; S. to points on the Milwaukee and its connections were unreasonable, unjust, unduly preferential and prejudicial and the same pointing was made with respect to Westbound Traffic terminating on the S. P. &amp; S. from points on the Milwaukee and its connections of coal, agricultural implements, iron, steel, grain, beans, grain and hogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.727" offset="2478268">The examiner also proposed the finding that through routes were necessary and desirable in order to provide adequate and more economic transportation to establish through routes and joint rates for these commodities in the directions indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.123" offset="2559875">The following year 1957, the Commission came out with its report and it adopted almost verbatim the examiner's language especially as discussion of the evidence but ended enough saying that we disagree and find that the conclusions of the examiner, the present rates, cost, undue preference of prejudice or unjust and unreasonable is not correct and they found that there were not -- there was no such violation of the Act as indicated by the examiner, and they found that there was no need in order to provide adequate more economic transportation to establish through routes and joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.088" offset="2719744">In due time, a petition for reconsideration was denied by the Commission, the litigation moved to the District Court for the Eastern District to Wisconsin and four issues were brought before the Court and they were stipulated by the parties as issues to be decided by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.738" offset="2786304">Number one, whether the S. P. &amp; S. system is or is not under common management or control with each of the competing Northern Lines, the Great Northern and Northern Pacific within the meaning of Section 15 (4) for the Interstate Commerce Act whether through routes presently exist in any case except where the presently limited line of joint rates apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.145" offset="2887973">Next, whether their -- the present rates constitute a violation of Section 3 of the interstate Commerce Act with respect to preference and prejudice against localities and shippers and with respect to discrimination against the Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.196" offset="2944188">And fourth whether, the evidence required the finding that the routes are needed to provide adequate and more economic transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.835" offset="2982745">In the District Court, the Secretary of Agriculture intervened as a plaintiff as did the National Livestock Producers, the American National Cattlemen, the National Wool Growers, and the Chicago Producers Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.263" offset="3028407">It took two years to get an opinion in this proceeding in the District Court and in 1960, the District Court opinion discussed the first issue only held that the evidence was sufficient to support the findings or provision to the second, third and fourth issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.095" offset="3119731">Now, the first issue was a question of common management or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.769" offset="3134464">And the District Court said that the S. P. &amp; S. system is under common management or control within the meaning of Section 15 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.540" offset="3181484">Whereupon, an appeal is taken to this Court by the Milwaukee and by the Secretary of Agriculture and again, the same four issues are presented for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.609" offset="3221817">After the briefs were field and discussion was held by myself with the attorneys, with the Department of Agriculture, it was determined that since the parties rely upon the same points that their position is in a sense identical that one argument could be presented and I am undertaking to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.175" offset="3304051">The argument, however, represents the views of the Department of Agriculture that incurs therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.206" offset="3332159">And so --</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond K. Merrill</label>
            <text syncTime="818.192" offset="3376149">Now, as in the recent through route joint rate cases, the question of whether Section 15 (4) which puts restrictions on the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to prescribe through routes is a very important feature in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.579" offset="3453680">Of course, Section 15 (4) has no application if the S. P. &amp; S. system is not under common management or control with each of the Northern Lines if through routes already exists by which additional joint rates are now sought, if the refusal of the S. P. &amp; S. system to enter in the joint rates and through routes with the Milwaukee Railroad is a violation of Section 3 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.812" offset="3550647">And even if 15 (4) does apply, if the routes are needed to provide adequate, more economic and efficient transportation, then the Commission should establish those routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.751" offset="3594428">And so, we come to the first question as found by the Commission that the S. P. &amp; S. system is under common management or control with each of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific Railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="932.454" offset="3833187">So it should go back to the Commission with the idea that they would then proceed to consider the case free and clear from the limitations of Section 15 (4).</text>

            <text syncTime="990.919" offset="4067035">I would say this, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.471" offset="4073305">If any of the first three issues are found in our favor, there is a requirement that it'd be remanded to the Commission because 15 (4) would have no application if any of those three as we argue were true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.069" offset="4135685">The statutory language of 15 (4) is as noted by the District Court below, cast in the singular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.582" offset="4169749">It says in establishing any through route that the Commission shall not, and I'm omitting this -- an immaterial part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.562" offset="4197648">Require any carrier by railroad without its consent to embrace in such route substantially less than the entire length of this railroad and of any intermediate railroad operated in conjunction and under a common management or control therewith which -- which lies between the termini as such proposed route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.599" offset="4277791">Now, right away, the question is a railroad and any intermediate railroad operated in conjunction and under a common management or control therewith, the question is what meaning did Congress intend?</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.567" offset="4337664">Do they mean any railroad and an intermediate railroad operated under a joint control?</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.796" offset="4362533">Or does the owning railroad have to be the sole owner or the dominating owner?</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.096" offset="4395760">This Court said in the United States versus American Railway Express 265 U.S. of 431, that this language aptly describes a single railroad system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.897" offset="4442990">And I presume the best -- one of the best sources of determining the meaning of the Act is to look at the legislation from which it emerges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.318" offset="4476635">This language of common management or control was added to the Interstate Commerce Act by the Mann-Elkins Act in the year 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.364" offset="4508818">And in Section 12 of the Mann-Elkins Act which contains this language and which -- also modifies other sections of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Congress had no -- no problem at all about making itself clear when it meant to refer to more than the single railroad system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.440" offset="4589171">It used the term carrier or carrier seven different times and the term line or lines two different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.052" offset="4615607">And if we look at Section 15 (3) which has many subparagraphs, we find that congress again had no trouble in expressing itself when it wanted to refer to more than a single railroad system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.258" offset="4668374">In paragraph (1), it refers to carrier or carriers and to individual or joint class -- classifications, regulations or practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.169" offset="4708080">On a paragraph (3), in paragraph (7), paragraph (8), in paragraph (13), they referred to carriers or carriers connecting line or lines, individual or joint rates and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.385" offset="4752906">Then when they deal specifically with the question of control, which is Section 15 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, they again spelled it out by saying that it shall be lawful with the consent of the Commission or any carrier or two or more carriers jointly to acquire control of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.514" offset="4829393">All -- I think it is also proper to look to whatever explanation the Senate Committee which recommended the enactment of this legislation had to say about the meaning of this short-haul protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.178" offset="4888116">And this Senate Committee had this to say, It would seem to be unreasonable to empower the Commission to require a railroad having a line of its own between two designated termini to allow a portion only of that line to be taken and linked up with other lines for the purpose of creating another through route in competition with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.529" offset="4977455">And I think the emphasis can well be laid on the words having a line of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.672" offset="5006085">The another way of determining the meaning of Congress is to look at the Sections of the Act most closely related to the -- the Section in which the language in question appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.367" offset="5064808">And for that purpose, we can turn to Section 1 and Section 3, which the Commission has said, Are the Sections most closely related to Section 15?</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.159" offset="5107963">Section 1 and particular paragraph (4), the Commission says that the theory of this provision is a carrier should freely interchange rate between their respective lines to the end that Interstate Commerce may move without interruption or delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.931" offset="5163133">And referring to paragraph (3), the Commission -- or Section 3, the Commission says that this provision brought in Section 1 and makes the intent of the Congress claim that every reasonable and proper facility shall be extended equally by a carrier to all of its connections and at no discrimination in its charges shall be made in favor of or against any connecting line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.385" offset="5260936">Well, actually we have to wait for 30 years to go by to get confirmation that Congress did not intend to include joint control but intended only that control by one carrier of another as what was intended by the term common management or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.811" offset="5334601">And in the year 1940, Congress enacted Section 1 (3) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.381" offset="5356857">And in that Section, they provided that in various sections of the Interstate Commerce Act, when the word control was encountered, it was to be given a broad interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.410" offset="5405027">It was to include actual as well as legal control and direct as well indirect control no matter how exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.692" offset="5434180">But the Commission very carefully omitted Section 15 (4) as a section in which the word control should be given that broad connotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.074" offset="5475662">The -- it might have been due to oversight that the Joint Conference Committee that reported out the legislation made it plain that this was deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.550" offset="5513592">And they said, The reason that it is not included is that the Congress is -- does not desire and that it is not desirable rather that any change be made in the present interpretation of Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.648" offset="5573987">So, then it is very important and the apellees concede, it important that we look at and see how the Commission had been decided these questions under Section 15 (4) prior to 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.499" offset="5633337">And the search of the Commission cases, I find that there were 11 occasions in which the Commission ruled on whether or not a carrier was under common management or control with another within the meaning of 15 (4) and in every case one railroad was in control by virtue of majority stock ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.018" offset="5715466">During that same period, there were three cases which arose in which the question of joint control was contended by the parties as constituting common management or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.012" offset="5763427">In the first case, the (Inaudible) case back in 1910, cited -- or 1914, four years after this law was enacted embracing the words common management or control and cited on page 26 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.308" offset="5824554">Two railroads jointly owned eight-ninths of the stock of a -- of a third railroad and together, they elected the majority of the Board of Directors of this railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.899" offset="5870947">And it was contented that this joint control placed one of the owners and the subsidiary under common management or control within the meaning of Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.850" offset="5910758">This notion, the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected and said they were not under common management or control within the meaning of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.601" offset="5953808">The case itself involved -- included evidence, however, that the owning railroads although they had obviously the power of control do not see fit to exercise, they gave a free hand to the subsidiary railroad to run its own affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.272" offset="6020472">The -- to the extent that that evidence is in the record, the appellees here would contend that that distinguishes the case from the present case, that if the railroads in that case had exercised a control actively as the Northern Lines claimed to jointly control the S. P. &amp; S. system, that would have been a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.331" offset="6108662">Well now, that means that the railroad can turn on and off the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to prescribe through routes or joint rates simply one month telling the subsidiary to go ahead and run your own affairs in the next month say, Well, this month we'll tell you what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.036" offset="6171564">I don't think that -- that power was ever vested in the railroads themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.077" offset="6191731">And finally, just before that decision by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the federal court said that, You can't distinguish between this power control and not exercising it and actual joint control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.547" offset="6249514">Because it's vain to say that the subsidiary railroad is not aware of the wishes of the two joint owners and that it's clear that because they are aware of those joint wishes, they are subject to their joint control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.007" offset="6319417">But all that the Commission deciding them that such control does not fall within Section 15 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the case is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.700" offset="6358183">The other two cases involved in the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis along by 15 railroads and as the Commission said, controlled by a majority of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.339" offset="6404681">In two cases in which it was contended, one -- that one of the owning railroads was under common management or control terminal and in the other case that all of the owning railroads were under common management or control of the terminal railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.256" offset="6456404">The Commission said, No, that is not common management or control within the meaning of Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.026" offset="6491512">Now, those are the only three cases in which the Commission definitely ruled that on the question whether joint control was common management or control within the meaning of Section 15 (4) prior to 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.030" offset="6551489">There's another case that comes up later on involving the S. P. &amp; S. system and the question of short-hauling and two cases that came up prior to 1940 involving the S. P. &amp; S. system and the question of joint hauling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.443" offset="6617109">This question -- these three cases are very enlightening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.576" offset="6633723">In the first case, the S. P. &amp; S. system cancelled its through routes with the Union Pacific whereby the S. P. &amp; S. would haul traffic to Portland, Oregon and then turn it or to the Union Pacific to haul beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.024" offset="6703417">Complaints were filed seeking the reinstatement of those through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.130" offset="6719927">The S. P. &amp; S. system came in and said, We are entitled to our full long haul to Spokane of 500 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.407" offset="6760991">They did not claim they were entitled to a full long haul over their line and then the Great Northern over their line and then the Northern Pacific as far as the Twin Cities as they are claiming in this present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.395" offset="6804982">They said, As far as full can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.006" offset="6815431">We point out in this case that the -- no contention was made that they were entitled to that longer haul and that the Commission made no finding they were and the railroad appellees in this case contend well, the Northern Lines weren't parties to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.509" offset="6881364">But the report shows that the members of the Transcontinental Freight Bureau were represented at the hearing and that the Commission's file shows they filed a brief and the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific have always been members of the Transcontinental Freight Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.352" offset="6936743">In the second case, it involved the question or complaints seeking through routes from origins on the S. P. &amp; S. and other railroads to Spokane and then via Canadian routes to destinations back in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.665" offset="7002049">And it was contended that the S. P. &amp; S. system there was under common management or control and that they were entitled to this through routes -- to the protection of their through routes over the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern East to Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.910" offset="7071013">The ICC, however, avoided a decision whether or not the S. P. &amp; S. and the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific were under common management or control within the meaning of Section 15 (4) by saying, We have no jurisdiction to prescribe through routes by its -- by its candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.017" offset="7151470">And so, from the statutory language of Section 15 (4) from the law from which it emerged, from the statute with which it forms apart, from the laws with which it is to be read to most closely in connection with, and from the indication by Congress itself as to what it meant by approving the decisions of the Commission and by reference to those decisions of the Commission, we can come to only one conclusion that Congress intended to refer to a single railroad system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.523" offset="8201488">And under that paragraph, there is no reference to the term common management or control whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.599" offset="8229804">The rulings of the Commission under that Section therefore, have no occasion to interpret the meaning of Congress as intended by the words common management or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.023" offset="8283512">The Commission for its own convenience, however, in prescribing rates sometimes will set up within a limited area distant scale rates where every five miles the rate steps up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.630" offset="8333876">And for two railroads, they will permit a higher rate to be charged and the reason is that there's an interchange of traffic between the two railroads requiring a little extra terminal cost and they reflect that by giving the joint lines a higher rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.225" offset="8400227">And appellee say in those cases, the Commission where there is common management or control, the two railroads have said you must charge a single higher rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.665" offset="8442023">And that the Commission has extended that to a situation where two jointly -- where a railroad jointly owned by two other carriers participates in the hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.577" offset="8493641">Now, I can only point out that that is not the type of a case which involves interpretation of common management or control as intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.128" offset="8535855">And we can also point out what the Commission isn't even consistent in those kind of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.022" offset="8555499">And in a case in which the Southern Pacific owned 50% of its subsidiary railroad, the other 50% was controlled by a State that the Southern Pacific elected two of the directors and the State elected two of the directors and two interest together appointed a fifth neutral director.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.648" offset="8633971">And the question arose whether or not a movement or traffic over the Southern Pacific in the subsidiary line was a joint line haul or a single line haul, the Commission permitted the charging of the joint line haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.737" offset="8694366">Now, the Commission says that seven times we have said that for rate making purposes, the S. P. &amp; S.is a part of the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.016" offset="8751417">Actually, two of those cases are through route cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.727" offset="8766255">I've already mentioned one, I'm saving one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.172" offset="8780048">The other -- the other five, the Commission commented that -- I think in four of them, that for rate making purposes the S. P. &amp; S. system is deemed a part of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.494" offset="8837308">But I cannot determine after reading those cases a dozen times or something less than that, just what they meant by saying that they were a part of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific for rate making purposes except in one case in which they were fixing the valuation of the S. P. &amp; S. system and the Commission said that in computing the cost of transporting material over the Northern lines that is used in the construction of the S. P. &amp; S. system, you will use the company line haul rates rather than the commercial rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.858" offset="8974817">The other cases, the Commission was not prescribing joint line scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.016" offset="8991431">They were not granting arbitraries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.448" offset="9001148">Just what importance the fact that the Commission said they should be regarded for rate making purposes as one line is certainly not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.939" offset="9043153">And in this valuation pace, they neutralize that by an approximately the same time in another case involving the valuation of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific said that the Great Northern and Northern Pacific cannot include in their valuation about the cost of constructing the S. P. &amp; S. system and therefore indicated by that decision that the S. P. &amp; S. system was not to be deemed a part of the Great Northern or the Northern Pacific system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.633" offset="9153912">Now, the lower court and the appellee say if you take away the protection of Section 15 (4) from a railroad which is under common management or control with two jointly owned railroads then they are not -- they're already prevented from getting arbitraries where hauls which the Commission awards to some short lines that are not under common management or control with two standard carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.947" offset="9283166">And therefore, it would be utterly unfair in this case to hold that the S. P. &amp; S. system is not entitled to the short-haul protection under Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.890" offset="9322977">We point out in our brief that the Commission has never had any trouble about giving arbitraries and here, our own arbitrary is that -- is that some additional charge with -- which a railroad which is a weak railroad financially and generally less than 100 miles along the short line has permitted the charge in addition to the regular rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.165" offset="9412002">One railroad, the Camas Prairie jointly owned by the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific, arbitraries was approved -- were approved for that railroad, another railroad, the Oregon-California and Eastern Railroad jointly owned by the Great Northern and the Southern Pacific permitted to charge arbitraries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.412" offset="9476995">Another one the Sunset Railway jointly owned by the Atchison, Topeka, Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific jointly allowed to charge was allowed to charge arbitraries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.226" offset="9516283">And the contour is that the S. P. &amp; S. system itself according to the Commission in a case which we have cited in our brief here charges arbitraries on traffic moving over its own branch lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.256" offset="9580440">So how there would be any discrimination or any ill results as far as the S. P. &amp; S. system is concerned is not and all clear if they were bound not to be under common management or control with the S. P. &amp; S. system with the Great Northern and Northern Pacific Railroad, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.609" offset="9665808">As far as joint line rates are concern, there's no evidence that anywhere ever prescribed in the S. P. &amp; S. territory but the S. P. &amp; S. system doesn't need joint line rates in 14 different tariffs where the rates are figured on a distant scale and the traffic moves over the S. P. &amp; S. and then the Great Northern for the S. P. &amp; S. in the Northern Pacific while they compute the distance over their own line up to the junction point, charge the rate for that movement and then compute the distance over the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern charge the rate for that movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.198" offset="9804152">And they say we'll collect the aggregate charge which is higher, of course, and which they treated themselves as a single line in-charge the rates over the combined distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.740" offset="9850337">And here is that case that I was saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.683" offset="9858069">It happens to be Helix Milling Company case in 1952.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.490" offset="9953364">In that case, joint rates were sought on wheat and wheat products from certain points in Montana on the Great Northern to go to Spokane and then to be hauled by the Northern Pacific from Spokane to Pasco, Washington and to receive milling in transit, and then from Pasco, Washington onto Portland, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.845" offset="10050748">Already existing were through routes over which the shipment can move to Spokane or over the Great Northern and then the Spokane Portland in Seattle railroad on to destination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.355" offset="10264743">And so the Great Northern and S. P. &amp; S. contended that the S. P. &amp; S. would get a short-hauling in this case if the routes were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.811" offset="10310614">The Commission recognized that there was a short-hauling issue because they went -- had to make all the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.079" offset="10335692">They quoted Section 15 (4) and then they made the findings that these routes were necessary to provide adequate and more economic transportation and ordered the routes installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.262" offset="10384384">And certainly, we failed to understand how if the S. P. &amp; S. system is to be treated separately from the Great Northern or the Northern Pacific and again, invoke Section 15 (4) to require the Commission to make the additional findings with short-haul, how they can in this case contend that they are actually only one in the same part of the Great Northern, one in the same with the Northern Pacific and try to invoke the short-haul protection for both the S. P. &amp; S., the Great Northern, and the Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.629" offset="10541850">That takes us to the second point of the through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.620" offset="10561808">Through routes is a rather troublesome subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.564" offset="10577586">The definition is simple enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.336" offset="10584691">It's an arrangement express or implied between two or more carriers for the continuous carriage to goods from a point on one railroad to a point on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.266" offset="10640488">The form of the rate whether it's a combination rate, whether it's a joint rate, makes no difference that was so held by Thompson versus United States, 343 U.S., 549.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.078" offset="10691688">The fact that the route is not commercially opened because the level of the rate is too high to permit a movement does not matter said this Court in Virginian Railroad versus United States 272 U.S., 658, and in a more recent case, Great Northern versus United States, 81 F.Supp.921, which was affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.360" offset="10792835">The Commission itself argued that if a route is commercially closed, it does not necessarily mean there is not a through route and the District Court affirmed position of the Commission and the decision of the District Court was affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.845" offset="10866709">Now in this case, the Milwaukee Railroad enters into a complete line of joint rates with the S. P. &amp; S. system over the Milwaukee's lines from the Twin Cities and east.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.469" offset="10929298">At the Twin Cities, the Milwaukee can take any commodity that originates on the S. P. &amp; S. Railroad, take it anywhere on its system or to points on its connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.257" offset="10968377">And coming from the other direction, traffic going to the S. P. &amp; S. , the Milwaukee can take any commodity over its lines east of the Twin Cities, but would -- in most cases, they're under it to the Great Northern nor the Northern Pacific at the Twin Cities to take on the Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.765" offset="11034415">So the east of the Twin Cities, the Milwaukee is not seeking through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.438" offset="11049148">They're already there or seeking through routes over our line from Spokane to the Twin Cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.755" offset="11078405">Over the route from Spokane to the Twin Cities, joint rates presently apply on lumber and forest products from all S. P. &amp; S. origins to all local points on the Milwaukee Railroad not only along our line from Spokane to the Twin Cities but east of the Twin Cities as far as the point just short of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.284" offset="11160534">And finally, there are joint rates on all commodities over our lines all the way from Spokane, all the way to Chicago and other points on traffic moving in export and import traffic, and that embraces any conceivable commodity that can move by railroad and the same is true on the westbound traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.555" offset="11253635">The Milwaukee already has through routes than on every commodity which can move over its line between Spokane and the Twin Cities and points beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.402" offset="11300968">Now, these routes, of course, do not apply except in connection, as I say, with lumber and forest products to points on the Milwaukee short to Chicago, or they only apply to traffic roaming in export or import traffic via six port cities of the S. P. &amp; S. system, port cities on the western and of the S. P. &amp; S. railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.438" offset="11621125">And export-import goods cover all conceivable commodities that can move in export and import traffic which are the same commodities that can move in domestic traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.087" offset="11667728">Now, we come to that next point, sir, with this observation that the Commission then went further and they said between all points where you don't have the joint rates, routes are available but the shipper will have to pay a combination rate which causes a higher charge and therefore the shippers are not generally inclined to use that kind of a route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.049" offset="11771591">Now, if the Commission says that a route is available, it can only mean one thing, that if the shipper wants the ship that way, he can ship that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.319" offset="11808684">And if he can ship that way, the route is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.625" offset="11825821">Now, if that -- does that mean then that wherever there is a connection that a shipper can move a shipment from a point of one railroad to the line on another and claim there is a through route?</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.796" offset="11874513">Section 15 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act says that a shipper -- that a carrier is bound to accept the shipper's routing where the through route is available and if the through route is not available, then that Section imposes no obligation upon the carrier to accept the shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.882" offset="11958941">And so when this Commission in this case said through routes are available, excuse me, routes are available, if a -- where the joint rates do not apply and to all points from the S. P. &amp; S. to all points on the Milwaukee and its connections, and if you tie that together with the joint rates that are applicable, at least the only one conclusion that through routes now exist over the Milwaukee's entire line in Spokane to the Twin Cities and beyond, and that all the Milwaukee is seeking here is not the establishment of through routes but the establishment of joint rates applicable thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.115" offset="12119855">And if our position is sound, Section 15 (4) no longer applies because Section 15 (4) applies only to the establishment of through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.427" offset="12177115">The two principle cases which our opposition raised, as disputing our position, is the Thompson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.311" offset="12208567">In that case, they sought routes from points on the Missouri Pacific out in Kansas to Omaha and grain and grain products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.631" offset="12245870">They wanted the traffic to move from the Missouri Pacific Origins to Concordia, Kansas and then go in Omaha or the Chicago Burlington in Quincy Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.310" offset="12288606">The evidence did not show that there was any traffic currently being interchanged to Concordia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.031" offset="12315460">In the present case, the record shows that 513 cars a year are interchanged by the Milwaukee Railroad and this S. P. &amp; S. at Spokane indicating that the arrangement for the interchanged of grade at that point is very much in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.798" offset="12382542">In the Thompson case, there were no joint rates applicable over the CBMQ's line to Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.505" offset="12409396">In our case, I have outlined the joint rates which do apply all the way from Spokane to the Twin Cities, to points beyond the Twin Cities and also to points on the connections of the Milwaukee Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.893" offset="12462895">Finally, there was no finding in the Thompson case that routes were avail -- available to a shipper, a combination rate should he wish to ship to Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.114" offset="12511796">And the most recent through route case which was the Ogden Gateway case, the Rio Grande versus the Union Pacific Railroad involved a request for through routes to be established in connection with the Union Pacific from the Northwest to Ogden, Utah then to Rio Grande to points in Colorado and ends connections beyond and in the reverse direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.375" offset="12620884">In that case, only 55 carloads a traffic a year were moving via the Ogden Gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.640" offset="12645961">And the Commission, they move at combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.867" offset="12658813">The Commission said that those are in the nature of isolated shipments and cannot be construed as indicating a holding out by the parties to offer through transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.548" offset="12709595">Here, the interchanges, 513 cars or 10 times as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.926" offset="12731120">The Court in the Union Pacific, Rio Grande case pointed out that the Union Pacific and the Rio Grande had -- had engaged in a long struggle to keep close at Ogden Gateway and the Rio Grande was trying to get it open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.388" offset="12796949">In this case, that struggle hasn't manifested itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.271" offset="12812413">The S. P. &amp; S. has entered into us -- into joint rates with us voluntarily as I have pointed out by Spokane, and the traffic does move via that gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.235" offset="12856299">The Rio Grande case -- this Court and the Commission found that because joint rates presently existed on sheep and goats over the Rio Grande's route that there were therefore through routes in existence on sheep and goats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.544" offset="12929546">Here, we show the joint rates existing on all commodities moving an export-import traffic and on lumber and forest products in particular over the length of our lines, Spokane to the Twin Cities and to certain points beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.064" offset="12995584">So, we point out that our case offers an entirely different situation and involved into the Thompson or the Rio Grande case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.831" offset="13038738">And in the Virginia Railroad case, which I pointed out earlier, says that even if the rates are too high a level to move the traffic, if the shipper can ship that way and these carriers offer service that way, if the shipper wants to use it, there are through routes available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.286" offset="13104567">And in that case, the combination rate was not only admitted by the carrier to be too high to move the traffic, the counsel for the carrier said, "We not only say they're too high, we admit they're impossible."</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.190" offset="13168097">And still, the Court was able to find that the through routes existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.232" offset="13188263">And so here, with the showing where you made of the joint rates applicable, the combination rates that are applicable, we feel strongly that the through routes are presently there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.529" offset="13241448">The remainder of my time, if I have any, I'd like to save for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.981" offset="13719280">This short-haul exception had its origin as counsel has stated, the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.039" offset="13751568">Sergeant Alton explained its purpose as follows on the Florida Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.822" offset="13770689">He said, "The second exception to the grant of this power is one of which has always been recognized in the transportation business of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.232" offset="13804335">The role that initiates the freight and starts it on its movement in interstate commerce should not be required where it is a line not unreasonably long.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.583" offset="13841742">The transports business from its own road of that of a competitor especially when the commerce initiated by it can be as promptly and safely transported by its road as by the line of a competitor."</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.889" offset="13898898">Specifically, it's the initiating carrier to whom shippers look for car supply, rate information, tracing lost cars and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.778" offset="13942471">At the same time as this Court long ago held in the Missouri Pacific case, protection against short-hauling is not restricted to the initiating carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.310" offset="13992626">The Commission -- the Interstate Commerce Commission has repeatedly recommended to Congress elimination or drastic modification of a short-hauling restriction and its power to establish through rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.982" offset="14051349">The various committee reports, which congressional committees have issued on the subject, have not articulated specific reasons as to why Congress persist in maintaining short-haul protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.249" offset="14108400">To find those reasons at least the only way we can find them is to look to the testimony of the object -- of the -- of the objecting railroads before the congressional committees objecting to the -- the elimination of short-haul protection and that's where we find it we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.199" offset="14176214">For example, in 1938, an officer of the appellant Milwaukee testified before House Interstate Commerce Subcommittee against the bill which would have repealed the short-haul clause of Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.481" offset="14233266">And he justified this short-haul protection on the following grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.840" offset="14254686">I like to quote in briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.532" offset="14261478">The Milwaukee road operates from Indiana to the North Pacific Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.801" offset="14278614">It has many mainline secondary mainlines, branch lines, and sub branch lines, all welded into one system to serve the territory traverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.480" offset="14313305">In other words, it is a complete unit in itself from the territory service, built for the purpose of handling the traffic between all points on its lines where the routes are not unreasonably long compared with other routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.974" offset="14363251">Investments made with that purchase in view -- that purpose in view, equipment purchase and terminal facilities built to provide a complete transportation facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.112" offset="14403793">And it is unclear, said Milwaukee in 1938 to enact him to law a requirement that will permit the breaking up of this complete unit by the insertion of other route which would deprive it of its long haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.646" offset="14465964">And the Milwaukee officer went on to say, "There are but few branch lines that are self-sustainable and unless the traffic originating or terminating on branch lines produces long main line hauls."</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.043" offset="14519568">It is only a question of time when their burdens on other parts of the line are so great that abandonment becomes necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.351" offset="14560737">This protection against short-hauling is available not only to a single carrier, to a single railroad but also to any intermediate railroad operated in conjunction and under a common management and control railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.694" offset="14614131">For example in this case, through routes between S. P. &amp; S. and Milwaukee via -- via Spokane could not short-haul S. P. &amp; S. because S. P. &amp; S. Eastern Terminal is at Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.726" offset="14674317">However, the Commission found that S. P. &amp; S. is operated in conjunction with and under common management and control Great Northern and Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.340" offset="14712769">The part is referred to for convenience as the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.460" offset="14729174">And accordingly, it concluded that Great Northern and Northern Pacific were entitled to short-haul protection against the establishment of through routes between S. P. &amp; S. points and Milwaukee via Spokane, routes which with short-haul the Northern Lines by the entire distance between Spokane and Minneapolis, St. Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.049" offset="14827604">The following facts and they are essentially undisputed, support the Commission's conclusion that S. P. &amp; S. is operated in conjunction with an under common management and control with Great Northern and Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.197" offset="14884133">The Northern Lines built S. P. &amp; S. about 1909 and 1910 for the purpose of relieving congestion, avoiding double tracking over the Cascade Mountains and providing a road of low grades along the Snake and Columbia Rivers to the West Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.493" offset="14957380">They have owned from the beginning in equal shares the stock and the bounds of S. P. &amp; S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.883" offset="14982875">Their presidents take turns alternating as president and vice president of S. P. &amp; S. , and they personally act upon the more important matters involved in S. P. &amp; S. S. P. &amp; S. depends substantially upon the Northern Lines for its cursive line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.697" offset="15058108">The freight traffic practices and policies of S. P. &amp; S. are directed and controlled jointly by the traffic departments of Northern Lines, while S. P. &amp; S. enjoys consultable autonomy in local rate matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.534" offset="15113488">Its rates and practices relating to the long haul transcontinental traffic, which is what this intercarrier fight is about, are handled for it by representatives of the two Northern Lines and it has always for the 50 years that -- that S. P. &amp; S. has been in existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3801.818" offset="15310660">So, intermediate between local rates and transcontinental, if the -- the partners disagree S. P. &amp; S. can go ahead on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.033" offset="15347545">But one thing that the partners -- the Northern Lines had always agreed on since 1910 is to preserve for themselves the long hauls on traffic originating or terminating on S. P. &amp; S. points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.469" offset="15413269">In this policy, the result of this policy is shown in the fact that in 1952, Milwaukee interchanged 513 carloads at Spokane with S. P. &amp; S., while in Northern Lines were interchanging 54,000 cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.254" offset="15488397">That's the policy since 1910 and that's how effective it has -- it has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.081" offset="15519744">So with that, the Commission's finding that the traffic policy of S. P. &amp; S. is controlled by its joint parents, the Northern Lines is supported by ample evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.180" offset="15564048">It's scarcely disputed in view of the figures as to interchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.272" offset="15584423">Now, we suggest that the Great Northern alone owned S. P. &amp; S. and controlled its traffic policy that will be admitted that the two carriers would be operating in conjunction under common management and control, so that both will be treated as a unit for the purpose of short-haul protection under Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.880" offset="15674911">That would be same thing if Northern Pacific alone owned and controlled S. P. &amp; S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.544" offset="15705527">In our principle contention here, is that the purposes of Section 15 (4) requires that Great Northern and Northern Pacific as joint owners and jointly controlling S. -- S. P. &amp; S. traffic policy are likewise entitled to -- to protection against short-hauling, the same protection against short-hauling that a single owner admittedly would get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.574" offset="15817644">Well again, that purpose is to provide protection against short-hauling for railroad facilities which even have owned by different carrier corporations are operated as a unit in performing transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.089" offset="15879711">Again, if each of the Northern Lines had financed, built and control as separate railroad from Spokane to the coast, each would be entitled a short-haul protection and traffic to and from points on its separately owned and separately controlled route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.639" offset="15957974">Here, it seems to us clear from the history of the whole matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.660" offset="15973961">For obvious reasons of economy, the two Northern Lines jointly built the S. P. &amp; S. to enable them to provide better transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.015" offset="16019414">Then we submit that they are entitled to the protection of that investment for their reasons which were so well stated by Milwaukee's officer testifying in -- in favor of short-haul protection in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.316" offset="16072600">Now, the briefs of the rail -- of the railroad parties, appellants and appellees have contained some dispute as to the amount of the Northern Lines investment in S. P. &amp; S.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.020" offset="16119411">I don't propose to go into that because by any measurement, the investment is substantial millions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.442" offset="16145115">That investment has not paid off in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.460" offset="16161207">It has paid off substantially in traffic originating on or destined two points on the S. P. &amp; S. traffic which in 1953 produced $22 million in freight revenues for the Northern Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.863" offset="16230797">Now, as Milwaukee testified in 1938 before the House Committee, unless the short branch lines produce long mainline hauls.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.455" offset="16269145">Their abandonment may become necessary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="4635.927" offset="18647124">Now, the appellant's attached great weight to a grammatical analysis of Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.328" offset="18668648">And they urged that the language against short-hauling is in the singular and it applies only to a railroad and to a railroad operated in conjunction and under common management and control of the first railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.692" offset="18754121">And we think that argument is fully answered by this Court's decision in Louisville and Nashville Railroad v. United States in 242 U.S. decided by this Court in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.419" offset="18789021">That case involves the former Section 3, paragraph (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act which then provided that every common carrier shall not discriminate in their rates and charges between such connecting lines, but this shall not be construed as requiring any such common carrier to give the use of its tracks or terminal facilities to another carrier engaged in like business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.359" offset="18884838">Well, you see such carrier, its tracks that that in -- in the old Section 13 (3) that imported the singular too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.988" offset="18923290">Now, that provision is rather germane to Section 15 (4) because both deal with the competitive relationships between railroad carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.078" offset="18963728">In that case, the Louisville and Nashville case, the question that -- Louisville and Nashville, and Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad, which jointly owned the Nashville Terminal Railroad whether they were discriminating against Tennessee Central by requiring their terminal company to switch cars for them, but -- by prohibiting their terminal company from switching cars for Tennessee Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.937" offset="19075114">The Commission had found that difference in treatment toward Tennessee Central to be unjust discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.890" offset="19106983">This Court disagreed, setting aside the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.931" offset="19123075">This Court stated that what one carrier admittedly can do by refusing to switch for another over its terminal fact, said the Court, "We can see that what is true of one owner would be equally true of two joint owners."</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.928" offset="19191097">So we submit that the L.&amp; N. decision stands for the same proposition which indeed we find in the first section of the United States Code, Section 1 -- Section 1 of Title 1 that whether statutory language phrased in a singular should be read to include the plural, it depends upon the purpose of the particular statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.842" offset="19278764">But we think the L.&amp; N. case stands for a bit more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.762" offset="19294438">We think it stands for the principle that two joint owners of a railroad can invoke the same protection against the competition of other carriers which the Act provides for a single owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.055" offset="19351594">In the L.&amp; N. case, two joint owners of a terminal were entitled to the protection of the former Section 3 (3) against allowing use of their terminal facilities by another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.202" offset="19408227">And here, by what we think is the closest of analogies, the two northern lines which owned S. P. &amp; S. and control its traffic policy should we submit the entitle to the protection against short-hauling, which a single owner admittedly would enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.407" offset="19497044">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="4863.807" offset="19558588">I -- I appear here for the appellee railroad companies who were dependents or intervening dependents in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.784" offset="19598503">And the carriers principally involved are the S. P. &amp; S., Spokane and Portland &amp; Seattle Railway and its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Oregon Trunk and Oregon Electric and the Great Northern and Northern Pacific, which equally owned all the bonds and stock of the S. P. &amp; S. The major issue in this case of course arises under Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.558" offset="19709576">That is, whether within the meaning of that Section, two joint owners can sole exercise control over a jointly owned subsidiary to entitle both to the protection against short-hauling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.858" offset="19766836">Mr. Ginnane has argued that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.117" offset="19779793">I am not going to repeat or elaborate to any extent on the argument that we have on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4925.904" offset="19806960">I do want to simply say to the Court that when Congress reenacted the Section 15 (4) in the Transportation Act of 1940, the legislative history shows that they desire to make no change in the interpretation then given to the word control in Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.579" offset="19901733">And so in our brief, we have made or rather elaborate statement of the history of the interpretation of the words common management or control in Section 15 (4) and in Section 15 (1) cases wherein the Commission was prescribing reasonable rates and we have asserted that the interpretation should be uniformed in the administration of all courses of Section 15 to prevent inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.333" offset="20040704">The principal issue that I want to talk about is the existence of through routes and Mr. Justice Whittaker asked what a through route was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.310" offset="20084590">A through route is an arrangement expressed or implied between two carriers whereby they will join in the transportation of a property from point A on railroad A to point B on railroad B.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.390" offset="20148955">Now, that maybe subject to a joint through writ published by the term -- parties in their tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.427" offset="20185109">Or, a through route may exist where the rate applicable over the through route for the through transportation is a combination of the local routes, local rates of each of the two carriers to and from the junction point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.645" offset="20253968">In the usual case of the through routes exist by reason of a publication by carriers in their tariffs of a specific statement of what commodity will be carried from where to where at what rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5071.354" offset="20388760">I didn't say a physical connection would establish a through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.261" offset="20404433">A through route may exist over a route where the applicable rates are a combination of locals and that comes into existence by reason of a practice of the carriers in holding themselves out as this Court has said in two cases as being prepared to give the through transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.523" offset="20485413">But if there is no such holding out, the mere physical track connections do not create a through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.167" offset="20519999">In this case, Mr. Merrill points to the language of the Commission where the Commission did say that routes are available via the Milwaukee from S. -- to and from S. P. &amp; S. points via Spokane, but they are not used because the combination of rate is too high and they are commercially closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.541" offset="20601501">The Commission did say that, but in the very next paragraph, Commission went on to say, But these are not through routes, within the meaning of Section 15 (3) and Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.922" offset="20651029">They are physical routes, but not through routes because there was no evidence that the carriers held themselves out as being prepared to give through service over that route, S. P. &amp; S. Milwaukee via Spokane.</text>

            <text syncTime="5160.805" offset="20746637">Holding themselves out and being prepared to give the through service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.346" offset="20760743">Now in this case, the carriers, the S. P. &amp; S. and the Milwaukee did join in several joint through rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.182" offset="20808077">The one which carried the most traffic was a joint through rate on petroleum products from a point on the S. P. &amp; S. East Pasco, Washington, which incidentally is the terminal of Salt Lake Pipeline where petroleum products originate for rail movement to seven main stations on the Milwaukee in Idaho and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.539" offset="20909537">Now, those are through routes on petroleum products from East Pasco to those particular points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.974" offset="20943287">But those petroleum rates are not evidence of existence of through rates on any other commodities or between any other points on the S. P. &amp; S. system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.601" offset="20977768">And that follows, if Your Honors please from the decision of this Court in the Thompson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.203" offset="21008175">There, there were physical track connections between the Burlington and the Missouri Pacific at Concordia, Kansas and there were through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.937" offset="21051120">The carriers held themselves out as being prepared to give through transportation service from points on the Missouri Pacific, west of their junction to the junction and to points on the Burlington, short of Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.699" offset="21118203">And the Court specifically held that the evidence -- that the existence of though routes to point short of Omaha was not evidence of the existence of through routes to Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.577" offset="21165641">And that is the situation here with respect to every one of these through routes which do exist by reason of tariffs published and contained in the Appendix B of the Commission's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.257" offset="21216423">Lumber, yes, we have through routes on lumber from S. P. &amp; S. origins to local points on the Milwaukee, east of Spokane, but not two points on connections to Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.416" offset="21285073">They have to stop at local points on the -- on the Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.710" offset="21302209">Now, that's exactly the same situation which existed in the Denver and Rio Grande case where in this Court affirmed the order of the Commission which was based on the finding that through routes did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.024" offset="21359470">There were in the Rio Grande case, through routes published on lumber from Union Pacific origins in the northwest via Ogden to local points on the Rio Grande, but not to the eastern termini of the Rio Grande or not beyond the eastern termini of the Rio Grande of so-called common points, Colorado common points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.436" offset="21465109">And not -- they did not apply to destinations on connections of the Rio Grande, east of Colorado common points and the Commission found that there were no through routes except on sheep and goats and that lumber.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.370" offset="21536893">And this Court affirmed the finding on the basis of the Thompson case and reiterated the test in the Thompson case of holding out as being prepared to give transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.503" offset="21601364">Now, the Milwaukee relies on the Virginian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.284" offset="21652459">In the Virginian case, the Court -- the Commission found that through routes existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.730" offset="21686314">How they came into existence or what they were, I don't know, except that only combination rates applied over the Virginian and its connections to the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.218" offset="21732289">But through routes existed and relief was not sought under Section 15 (3) of the Act under which the Commission has a power to establish new routes because as the Court said, Through routes to the west were already in existence and there were through rates by combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.222" offset="21808253">Now, the Virginian case is not applicable here as was pointed out by the Court in the Thompson case where they said in a footnote, Virginian Railroad against United States is in opposite since through routes were found to be in existence but commercially closed solely because the unreasonable discriminatory charges charged by the Virginian over its portion of the route.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.020" offset="21915460">So that the Virginian case is not authority for a finding -- to support a finding that any through routes exist except those which are subject to the published through rates in which the S. P. &amp; S. and the Milwaukee already joined of which petroleum is the outstanding example and the lumber is probably the next important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.149" offset="21999992">I want to comment just for a moment on these export and import rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.280" offset="22016502">Yes, we have a full line of export and import rates with the Milwaukee, but they apply only to and from six Tidewater ports on the Willamette and Columbia Rivers of -- stations of the S. P. &amp; S. and do not apply to or from any other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5499.355" offset="22100825">Furthermore, they apply only on commodities which are to be exported-imported having the -- those traffic characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.958" offset="22139173">It's exactly the same thing as the Thompson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.295" offset="22148577">Those rates certainly are not evidence to the existence of rates on -- routes on lumber from a point such as Eugene, Oregon, 125 miles away from Tidewater.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.082" offset="22203747">They are evidence only of through routes on traffic to and from those Tidewater ports and having those particular characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.496" offset="22245334">The Milwaukee has made quite a point of the fact that 513 cars were interchanged in the year 1952 at Spokane between the Milwaukee and the S. P. &amp; S. of those substantially 500 cars were eastbound, lumber and petroleum products, livestock on which they are joint through rates as included in the appendix B.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.966" offset="22383261">There were less than 15 cars as I remember which moved westbound and there were a variety of commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.275" offset="22408443">Now, except for few cars of livestock, I -- we can't identify as the record now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.332" offset="22444701">What rates were charged on those 10 or 15 cars?</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.280" offset="22460479">But even though they moved on combination rates and there's no evidence in the record that they did move on the combination rates, it's exactly similar to the 55 cars that trickled through and which the Commission in this Court found did not justify acclaiming of the existence of the through read -- route in the Rio Grande case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.527" offset="22549504">The Commission specifically found the record indicates that the foregoing 513 shipments moved on joint through rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.177" offset="22588061">There is no indication of any traffic, has ever been solicited for routing via Spokane over a Milwaukee S. P. &amp; S. route via which a higher combination rate applied or has ever moved over such a route.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.900" offset="22638947">Now, that finding was contained in the examiners' report and incidentally, the finding that the Commission made that no through routes existed were in the examiner's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.413" offset="22701014">The Milwaukee in its exemptions, the examiner's report did not accept either of those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.064" offset="22731630">They did attempt in a reply to exemptions by other parties to raise the question of the existence of through routes, but the Commission sustained our motion to strike that portion of the reply as improper at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.721" offset="22794219">They raised the point again of the existence of through routes on their petition for reconsideration, which was filed with the Commission and was denied, but never until the brief of the Milwaukee in this Court has had taken exemption to the finding that the 513 cars moved on joint through rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.660" offset="22885961">Now, they assert and the Secretary makes the same assertion that only 387 cars moved on joint through rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.289" offset="22920547">Consequentially, they say that 126 cars moved on a combination rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.489" offset="22945311">The witness who testified the 300 -- the particular 387 cars moved on joint through rates did not say that a single car moved to combination rates and there's nothing in the record to indicate where those 126 cars came from, what they cover or anything about them at all or what rates they moved under.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.036" offset="23043532">Furthermore, the inference that any cars moved at combination rates is rebutted by the Milwaukee's own witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.588" offset="23085746">I will not take the time of the Court to spell out that testimony in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.931" offset="23111137">It's in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.427" offset="23121063">But, the conclusions that one must draw from the testimony of their witness Nichols who presented Exhibit 1 that Mr. Merrill talked about developing the 513 cars and the testimony of their witness Hettinger who presented their Exhibit 18, who developed this figure of two and a half million that Mr. Merrill talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.905" offset="23227016">Inevitably, supports the conclusion that those cars moved at through rates for 513 cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.481" offset="23261288">Hettinger was attempting to develop what the increase in the Milwaukee Railway would have been, have they handled in long hauls Spokane all the cars in which they participated to any extent in line haul to and from S. P. &amp; S. points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5805.001" offset="23323355">There were 6300 of them, most of which they either received or delivered to another carrier at Minnesota Transport to Twin Cities after the Northern Lines got their long haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="5815.533" offset="23365465">But there were these 513 cars which were interchanged at Spokane.</text>

            <text syncTime="6850.295" offset="27504515">In answer to some comments by Mr. Ginnane, I want to point out that the S. P. &amp; S. Railroad, an old traffic which interchanges with the Milwaukee Railroad would get the long haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="6862.110" offset="27551848">Now, neither the Great Northern nor the Northern Pacific now have any short-haul protection against each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="6868.176" offset="27576090">Every car which the Great Northern handles of S. P. &amp; S. traffic is competitive with the Northern Pacific and the Northern Pacific is now short-haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.323" offset="27608691">The question is, can you be half safe?</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.361" offset="27620812">And I don't think that the law contemplates that a railroad can reserve only the right to be half protected by Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.212" offset="27656234">Now, the S. P. &amp; S. is now some little short line like Mr. Rockwood indicated that's a 950 mile long railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="6896.896" offset="27690924">It's a class one carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="6915.356" offset="27764799">The Burlington is much longer but I'm saying the S. P. &amp; S. is not just a branch line railroad, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6920.574" offset="27785697">And it's a mainline type of an operation over which through passenger runs as well as free trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.732" offset="27814327">In the Rio Grande case, I would like to point out if I may, that there were through routes found on sheep and goats, both by the Commission and by this Court notwithstanding those through routes were commercially closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6941.279" offset="27868453">Joint rates supplied on those commodities but they were hire and the rates via the Union Pacific and the record show there was no movement as sheep and goats via the Rio Grande, and I will stand on that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6955.217" offset="27924250">In the Louisville and Nashville case referred to by Mr. Ginnane, it was a 5-to-4 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6960.537" offset="27945566">The four dissenters pointed out that if this decision stood, it would affect a grave miscarriage and injustice and Congress responded by repealing that Section of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6972.642" offset="27993945">So I don't see any conflict between the laws that now exist and the interpretation which we request to Section 15 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="6983.715" offset="28038248">In the Rochester case referred to by Justice Frankfurter, the lower court went into the legislative history of the Act under which the joint management or control was brought up and determined from the legislative history that Congress there wanted a broad interpretation given to the meaning of the word "control".</text>

            <text syncTime="7008.993" offset="28139395">And I stand on that argument, and we rely very heavily that Congress did not want to apply a liberal definition to the word "control" under 15 (4).</text>
