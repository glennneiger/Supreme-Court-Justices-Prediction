            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2.480" offset="113246">Before the recess, I had outlined the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.847" offset="130800">Now, these facts are not disputed and upon the basis of these facts, the Commission made a determination which is also not disputed and that is that there was in fact undue preference to the -- people in official territory and in fact undue prejudice to the people in southern territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.996" offset="227349">This conclusion led to an order directing them to do away with the undue discrimination and this has been attacked solely on the grounds of jurisdiction, the jurisdictional issues of course being whether the Commission had any jurisdiction in this situation since both -- both of the rates were international rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.008" offset="327450">Now, briefly, on the jurisdictional question with respect to why we don't believe the unreasonableness part of this case is properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.677" offset="366111">The Commission's decision discusses the unreasonableness of the rate and its report, starting on page 61 and ending on page 79, reaches the conclusion that the rate was unreasonable and also that it would form the basis of a reparations order.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.425" offset="437060">But if you look at the order of the Commission on page 81 of the record, you will see that this order is directed solely to the question of ordering the carriers to do away with the prejudicial rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.994" offset="499336">There is no order directing the establishment of any reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.371" offset="516890">There is no reparations order.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.724" offset="526294">This is not unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.286" offset="532564">What the Commission did was, as far as the reasonableness and reparations point, it issued a preliminary determination here and said, “Filed necessary information pursuing to Rule 1.101 and subsequently, will get around to making reparations order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="125.788" offset="606542">Therefore, the only final action of the Commission which was before the District Court was the action of the Court on page 81 directing these carriers to end the prejudicial rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.123" offset="659832">The reasonableness was not before the Court and as a matter of fact, if a final reparations order had been issued, it still couldn't have come before this Court because it's established by United States against I.C.C. and other cases cited in our brief that final reparations orders do not go to a three-judge District Courts of the type that we had below here, they go to single-judge District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.162" offset="767979">In other words, to the extent that the District Court, the three-judge District Court here, purported to discuss to -- and find improper the Commission's reasonableness finding, they were without jurisdiction because there was no final order on the subject and because there -- that Court would not have jurisdiction if there had been a final order.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.170" offset="900054">The order of the Commission, Your Honor, directs them to eliminate the prejudicial rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.728" offset="922311">This Court has held in the Texas and Pacific case as you're aware that where a Commission order of that nature is issued, there must be an alternative available to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.539" offset="965569">There is such an alternative here.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.976" offset="975287">This order doesn't say which they should take, but they may eliminate this discrepancy in one of two manners.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.035" offset="1003499">They can withdraw their concurrence to the joint rates now in existence to official territory which would mean they would file reasonable and non-discriminatory domestic rates from the border to official territory points and eliminate the discrepancy in that way or if they don't choose to do that and this is their option, they can undo the discrimination by lowering their domestic rates now in effect from the border to southern territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.188" offset="1128155">But they have under this Commission order and this is made perfectly clear in the supplemental opinion that the Commission issued later on, they have this option of eliminating this discrepancy in either way they wish.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="275.716" offset="1206209">Oh yes, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.462" offset="1221256">Now, if as we suggest you vacate the order on reasonableness, that order of the District Court would not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.630" offset="1261902">Presumably what would happen would be that the Commission, while on the proper filings, would issue a reparations order and if the carriers didn't choose to comply with it under the ordinary procedures, the shippers would sue and then that issue would be before the Court in a proper manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.902" offset="1334941">Now, let me get to the merits of my jurisdictional argument with respect to the undue prejudice business.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.131" offset="1367855">The problem here, to the extent there's a problem, comes from the fact that the Interstate Commerce Act, and I suggest primarily is a matter of constitutional requirements, provides that the I.C.C. does have authority over international railroad transportation but only has authority, “but only insofar if such transportation takes place within the Unites States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="341.546" offset="1469524">In other words, it has authority over international railroad transportation insofar as it takes place within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.638" offset="1505886">Now, there have been a series of decisions in this Court of which you will hear more of later.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.933" offset="1527097">The News Syndicate case at volume 273, the Lewis-Simas-Jones case at volume 283, the Great Northern versus Sullivan case at volume 294 in which this Court has passed upon what is the authority of the Commission to determine and hold liable American carriers for the unreasonableness of an international rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.793" offset="1638588">And I think it can be summed up that the present situation on reasonableness is that if the carriers enter into a joint through rate voluntarily, they are liable for the reasonableness of that rate, jointly and severally, with the Canadian carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.649" offset="1718000">If instead they enter into a combination rate, of the type here, or rather they file their tariff from the border and the Canadians file their tariff to the border, then the cases seem to indicate that the carriers usually are only liable for the reasonableness of the part of the order that they have filed from the border to the American destinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.086" offset="1835760">As because of these findings in rate cases, presumably that the District Court thought the only issue in the case, and this appears on page 272 of the record, the only issue in the entire case was whether the Commission had jurisdiction over the portion of the transportation between the Canadian mines and Newport and East Alburgh, Vermont.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.105" offset="1967835">I -- I'm sorry, I mean 242, sir, quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.981" offset="1983300">You see the -- the District Court starts off its opinion saying, “A single question is presented, does the Commission have jurisdiction over the foreign factor because it involves transportation within the United States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="484.202" offset="2040142">Now, we submit that that is an -- an issue, maybe a decisive issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.509" offset="2061458">Certainly, an important issue in deciding whether the Commission could find that the international rate itself here was reasonable or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.479" offset="2109315">But we submit that that isn't the problem and that is out of the case and the question is not whether a rate is reasonable or not but whether the relationship between two rates is such that they cause undue discrimination within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.922" offset="2203042">Because the old case in this Court, United States against Illinois Central at volume 263, makes perfectly clear that even though both of two rates are reasonable and even though some of the carriers participating in these rates are beyond the Commission's jurisdiction, that if one or more carriers that are part of both rates, have it within their power to alleviate the discrepancy that the Commission has it within its power to order that discrepancy be -- be alleviated, then what is the jurisdictional question here, the real jurisdictional question?</text>
            <text syncTime="574.077" offset="2399692">Well, I presume there are two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.333" offset="2412753">The first question would be, “Is the Commission estopped form looking into this situation at all merely because these two rates happen to be international rates?</text>
            <text syncTime="588.557" offset="2457579">Does the fact that the joint through rate is an international rate and the combination through rate is an international rate estop the Commission from looking at the situation at all?”</text>
            <text syncTime="602.048" offset="2511600">The other question presumably would be, “If -- if they can look at it and find what's obviously true that they do result in discrimination, can they do anything about it within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="617.625" offset="2573876">As I understand the argument of the railroads, their argument is primarily the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.694" offset="2598118">They say that we have the right to file a local U.S. tariff from the border to the various points of destination in the United States and if we do that, we're only liable for the reasonableness of that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.430" offset="2669066">And therefore, you cannot look to the international rate for any purpose whatsoever because we're not liable, they say, for the reasonableness of the international rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.459" offset="7125243">We agree entirely with the argument which the Department of Justice has made and the Section 31 point, preference and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.585" offset="7165680">First, I'd like to comment briefly upon the suggestion of the Department of Justice that the issue of the railroads' liability of reparations under Section 1 of the Act was not properly before the District Court or before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.260" offset="7236420">It is suggested that that issue is not just justiciable until the Commission issues a final dollars and cents reparation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.122" offset="7275813">And -- and on the theory that when such an order is finally issued and if the railroads do not voluntarily obey it and pay then at that point under Section 16 of the Act, the shippers may maintain a suit on that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.123" offset="7347911">I don't deny the logic of the suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.566" offset="7365674">However, we are inclined to believe that this Court need not accept the suggestion, that for practical reasons, it could take a contrary view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.531" offset="7417501">To begin with, a determination of liability as distinguished from the computation of damages has been held to be --</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.227" offset="7460237">-- something which the courts can determine separately from the computation of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.985" offset="7483329">Now moreover, since the question of the Commission's jurisdiction with respect to preference and prejudice and is jurisdiction with respect to the reasonableness of the rates, arises out of the same transportation problem, it seems to us unfortunate that the two questions of jurisdiction arising out of the same transportation situation would have to be litigated separately by the parties by separate routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.397" offset="7616972">If both questions are now resolved, there would remain for any court in which a suit was brought on a reparations order, the detail questions as to whether the reparation for -- are accurately computed, whether the responsibility for particular shipments were assigned against the -- the carriers that were truly participated in the shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.406" offset="7725014">If the Court should agree with the suggestion of the United States, then we have a further concern as they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.435" offset="7753122">The opinion of the Court below while disclaiming authority to consider the validity of reparation orders is entirely devoted to discussion of the Commission's jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of the rates which is the very jurisdictional issue which would underlie in a subsequent reparations order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.162" offset="7840057">So we would urge that if this Court should agree with the suggestion of the Department of Justice then it should vacate the decision below insofar as it relates to the Commission's jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.470" offset="7909230">So that in any suit which may later be brought by these shippers on any future reparations order issued by the Commission, they will not then be cut off by a res judicata effect of the opinion of the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.644" offset="7990000">Assuming that Your Honors will hold that the issue of the Commission's jurisdiction as the reasonableness of the rates is properly before this Court, we contend the contrary to the court below that the Commission did have jurisdiction to determine that the through combination rates from the Canadian origins in this case to the southern destination points were unjust and unreasonable and that the shippers were therefore entitled to reparations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.305" offset="8656541">We have no reason to believe that they're anymore indifferent to the interest of -- of shippers than the Interstate Commerce Commission is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.502" offset="8689351">We can leave that to them I suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.411" offset="8708995">Now, the rates in question consist of two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.850" offset="8726758">This cut through combination rate consists of two factors, a so-called proportional rate applicable only on the through traffic, established by the Canadian lines from the Canadian mines, the origins, to East Alburgh and Newport in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.270" offset="8808469">And the second factor of this combination rate, are the various classes or joint commodity rates which the American carriers have established from East Alburgh and Newport to the southern destinations, mostly in North and South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.558" offset="8869595">East Alburgh is three miles south of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.102" offset="8883806">Newport is five miles south of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.000" offset="8895404">The Canadian lines here involved run into East -- East Alburgh and Newport where they physically interchange traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.635" offset="8933961">Now the act for -- Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act specifically provides that it applies to international rail traffic but only insofar as such transportation takes place within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.305" offset="8996551">Now, in this case the shippers attacked the entire through combination rate as unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.120" offset="9023822">They did not attack the factor consisting of the rates from Alburgh and Newport to the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.683" offset="9050154">Now, the appellee railroads raise only a question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.559" offset="9069589">They contend that they publish rates from the boundary to the south, that's the American railroads, and that these rates are not attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.108" offset="9107832">And they contend that the proportional rates of the Canadian lines, the other factor in the combination rate, are not subject to the American Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.773" offset="9158510">The Commission rejected the -- the railroads' contention that they had published rates to the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.258" offset="9188394">Noting the Newport and Alburgh were three and five miles south of the boundary respectively, the Commission held or they had found that the proportional rates maintained by the Canadian lines to these points, that's Alburgh and Newport, obligate those carriers to provide substantial transportation service within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.985" offset="9283271">Now, it's undisputed that Canadian railroad performing transportation service within the United States is just as much subject to the Interstate Commerce Act as -- as an American railroad is or the same as an American railroad performing service in Canada is subject to Canadian law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.280" offset="9356518">However, the railroads contend that as a practical matter, East Alburgh and Newport should be considered as border points because they were right on the Canadian-American border.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.319" offset="9404688">And the court below agreed with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.800" offset="9414614">It said, “Surely the fact that interchange occurs a few miles on one side of the boundary instead of the few miles in the other side is a fortuitous event on which Congress could not have intended that the Commission's jurisdiction should depend.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.509" offset="9481383">Now, we admit that Government regulation around an international boundary, in fact all sorts of business around an international boundary, is a technical business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.644" offset="9521925">It involves arbitrary lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.800" offset="9534568">Now, the Interstate Commerce Commission has routinely treated as border points such places as Detroit, Port Huron, Nogales on the Mexican border which in fact are right adjacent to the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.006" offset="9599352">We haven't taken the position that that the border at Detroit is the middle of the Detroit River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.321" offset="9628609">We have assumed that Detroit right on the boundary river is a boundary point, but a line must be draw -- applied somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.453" offset="9665181">There comes a point at which the Interstate Commerce Act must be applied with Canadian carriers operating within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.898" offset="9698931">For reasons of topography or operating convenience, those interchange points theoretically might be 10 or 15 miles south of the border and as an operating matter as a commercial matter that might be perfectly bona fide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.294" offset="12988583">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Members of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.486" offset="13017318">I hope I can do something to clarify what I think is the very simple issues before this Court and if I may say so at the outset without the slightest disrespect to either of my distinguished opponents, I'm amazed that neither the Department of Justice nor the Commission has seen fit to face up to what we say is the very, very simple issue that requires determination one way or the other by this Court, which we think was determined by the three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.167" offset="13167992">And that is this question of jurisdiction and whether it must be said to be determined on the basis of whether or not a rate applies to the actual international boundary line or whether the boundary line for practical purposes of rate making maybe regarded as some distance away from the exact international boundary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.115" offset="13283871">And because of our thinking on that point, we say that the issue here is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.782" offset="13318457">The Interstate Commerce Commission either had jurisdiction over these complaints and the right to determine among the basis of recognized principles which it's -- usually applies in the conventional cases before it or it did not, in which event the complaints were defective on their respective faces and should have been dismissed forthwith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.220" offset="13416260">Now, that's the simple position that we have taken since the first complaint was filed a number of years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.940" offset="13451160">It's the position we adhered to when four additional complaints were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.635" offset="13473938">It's the position we adhered to in our efforts to have the case reconsidered by the Interstate Commerce Commission and at the position that we, I'm glad to say, adhered to successfully before the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.094" offset="13535796">Now, I think it helps considerably to or should help considerably to this Court's consideration of this matter, if I undertook to talk a minute about the nature of the rates involved and what I understand to be the Court's prior dealing with jurisdictional matters affecting international traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.367" offset="13656795">Now, first of all, as you've already heard, there are such things as joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.113" offset="13679783">A rate that applies as a single entity from a point of origin regardless of whether it's in a foreign country or this country to a destination regardless of where it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.972" offset="13723251">In any event, it's a single entity, one rate, one factor which applies and is made in the first instance by the voluntary agreement of the various railroads participating therein.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.860" offset="13802768">It might be, Mr. Justice Douglas except that I'd like to say this as long as you ask me about it that in case this is of any enlightenment to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.636" offset="13837876">Proportional rates are what I would call a qualified rate whether they'd be a single line rate, made without anybody else's agreement as the Canadian rates were in this instance or whether they are joint rates made up of the agreement of two or more lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.401" offset="13908929">But the significance to me of an -- of a proportional rate is the fact that it's something special, it's a limited rate, it doesn't have general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.045" offset="13951561">In this instance, as I think is clear from the record in the various briefs, if a shipment of this particular commodity were made from one of the origin mines to either East Alburgh or Newport, Vermont, the -- the Canadian factor which is involved in these proceedings would have had no application because there's a specific tariff provision that restricts its application in the case like that and -- or good, bad or in different reasons throughout the -- for more than 50 to 75 years at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.166" offset="14100041">I have no hesitation in saying, it has been -- those -- that type of rate has been referred to in the commerce world as a proportional rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.743" offset="14142360">It's -- they maybe made for a number of reasons, largely, I would say competitive reasons perhaps where one railroad or group of railroads may think it necessary to take something less than they would normally do for purposes of transportation competition or purposes of industrial competition, for purposes if you choose a foreign competition, the production in foreign lands that the railroad industry as such may feel some necessity of attempting to assist the industry, the manufacture on the one hand and itself on the other as transportation agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.309" offset="14316648">Now, the other type of rate of course is a local rate which maybe -- which usually would be a rate published by one railroad for so called local application and that it would be general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.338" offset="14372760">That rate would have -- if that -- if these Canadian rates had been published as so called local rates there would have been no restriction on their use whether the traffic, being shipped under them, were to come to rest finally at East Alburgh or Newport or whether it was to continue which journey down to Charlotte, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.760" offset="14450395">Now, it seems to me that most of the disagreement in the -- involved in this litigation stems from the failure of the Commission and our friends who argue for them to distinguish what this Court has previously said and done with respect to the Commission's jurisdiction over international traffic in the sense that you have heretofore been dealing with reparation cases, cases where rates for the future were not involved and reparation cases in which joint rates were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.220" offset="14628237">And it seems to me, from the beginning and -- and still does, that the law in that respect is crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.537" offset="14657494">As a matter of fact, I think it originated with the Commission itself who first enunciated the general doctrine in a case that's referred to, I'm sure through all our briefs, the so called Black Horse Tobacco case reported in 17 I.C.C. 588, as long ago as 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.494" offset="14753311">And the gist of the generally recognized rule is that American and I -- I emphasize the word American, American railroads have a clear alternative with respect to their participation in international traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.334" offset="14828753">They may publish rates to and from the border, in which event they are liable only for the lawfulness of those rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.604" offset="14877759">And when I say lawfulness, I mean lawfulness whether measured under Section 1, reasonableness or unreasonableness or Section 3 preference or prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.310" offset="14932616">Or they can enter into joint rates voluntarily in which event they become jointly and severally liable for the lawfulness of those rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.449" offset="14993220">And again, it doesn't make too much difference, I don't suppose whether you talk Section 1 or 3 or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.547" offset="15021537">So that I hearsay if I may repeat that the simple question here is the -- is whether the Commission had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.163" offset="15056018">It either did or did not and I say this Court, no more than the three-judge court, doesn't have to journey too far into the woods and fail to see the trees if I may use a common expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.115" offset="15115786">In this instance, you've been told a little bit about already and we have discussed at length in our brief three cases that seems to me are all that need to be examined in order for this Court to make its determination of the issue before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.381" offset="15188929">The first is the so called News Syndicate case reported at 275 U.S. 179.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.576" offset="15229680">The second is the Lewis-Simas case reported at 283 U.S. 654 and the third is the Great Northern versus Sullivan case to which, Mr. Ginnane has already referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.456" offset="15301151">Now, each of those cases was a reparation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.461" offset="15321213">I -- I was inclined to say that reparation here is an incidental aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.190" offset="15348172">That's the tail on the horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.135" offset="15355904">I'm sure my good friend, Mr. Ussery wouldn't agree with me on that point but I do say that before you start to worry about whether the rates have been unreasonable or otherwise unlawful in the past, the big thing to be determined here is the question of whether or not the Commission had jurisdiction to take these complaints and deal with them at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.526" offset="15441481">And you can forget all about the reparation insofar as that particular aspect is concerned because if they didn't have jurisdiction, that's the end of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.478" offset="15485262">If they did, I -- I guess we're at the end of the line and are wasting our time and that of the Court's in arguing to --</text>

            <text syncTime="4270.364" offset="17184789">The point here is whether or not we in fact publish rates to or from the border.</text>

            <text syncTime="4312.949" offset="17355212">The Commission said that their jurisdiction attaches at ports of entry and without going into any considerable detail let me point out that we have listed in appendices (c) -- in appendix (c) of our brief a large number of cases where the Commission itself has in effect followed that statement of principle that they would not deal with the measure of the rate that applied from a so-called border point within the United States to a destination in Canada or vise versa.</text>

            <text syncTime="4375.549" offset="17605569">But for the first time that I can discover in our particular case, they say that that sort of a situation is not sufficient to -- to deprive them of jurisdiction that on the contrary, it gives them jurisdiction because the Canadian factor, says the Commission, obligates the Canadian carriers to perform substantial transportation service within the United States.</text>
