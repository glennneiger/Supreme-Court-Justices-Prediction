            <text syncTime="18.074" offset="175626">With the permission of the Court, I should like this morning to refer Your Honors to several specific places in the record where I think there are contained findings of fact which pretty clearly established what this particular case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.437" offset="229125">First in Volume 4 of the transcript of the record as you all kindly turn to page 88, you will see about two thirds of the way down a portion of the opinion of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.433" offset="293073">I might say incidentally that the District Court states and that in addition to the findings of fact, which it makes specifically that the findings and the statements contained in its opinion, are to be treated as findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.132" offset="331943">Where is that (Voice Overlap) --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_e_kohn" startTime="58.308" stopTime="345.860">
            <label>Mr. Harold E. Kohn</label>
            <text syncTime="58.308" offset="336645">Page 88, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.225" offset="348244">Beginning with the italicized portion, it was the purpose and intent of Messrs, Deegan, Littlefield and Mackie.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.560" offset="381576">Those are all railroad or Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference officials on the one side and Byoir on the other to hurt the truckers in every way possible even though they secured no legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.890" offset="438941">It was their purpose to restrict the activities of the truckers in the long-haul industry to the greatest extent possible and finally, if possible, to drive them out of that segment of the entire transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.882" offset="498918">Now, if you'll turn please to page 100 or just (Inaudible) before this.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.794" offset="526503">The Court states in the first whole paragraph on that page beginning about halfway down, it was a matter of first impression with the court upon the original reading of the complaint when this suit was instituted some four and half years ago that the charges made were rather incredible nature and that plaintiffs herein will have the most difficult test to establish their contentions by a fair preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.196" offset="612185">It is now apparent that with the exception of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, actual bribery of public officials and bribery of officers of public organization, the plaintiffs approved by a great preponderance of the evidence that a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts actually existed its formation, its purpose, and the means by which it was affected and generally in the form and manner as alleged in the complaint, and I will refer to the complaint just a moment or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.151" offset="727960">At page 101, the last paragraph beginning on that page, the Court has found as a fact that the railroads in Byoir entered into a conspiracy and unreasonable restraint of trade, the nature and purpose of which was to injure the truckers and their competitive position in the long-haul freight industry in the Northeastern section of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.321" offset="808626">This of course involves interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.861" offset="818866">The immediate purpose was to create public resentment to the truckers, not only in the minds of the general public, but in the minds of those who utilize the service of the trucks and in such a manner as to interfere with business relations between shippers and truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.378" offset="876857">Then finally, at the bottom of page 102 the sentence beginning about five lines from the bottom instead, "Instead of meeting the competition in the field in giving the shippers what the shippers wanted they," that's the defendants, "determined upon another course of action to injure and/or destroy the truckers and thereby force the shippers to their detriment to continue to use the railroads."</text>
            <text syncTime="218.459" offset="977168">Now, if you could please turn back to page six but I want to show you one or two paragraphs of the complaint which make it quite clear that throughout this case and not only as episode at the end was the problem of our suppliers, shippers, customers and so on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.405" offset="1048952">On page 6 of the same volume of the record to which I have previously eluded, you will see under subheading E of paragraph 16 among the things that we complained that they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.520" offset="1109452">Vilification and defamation of the plaintiffs by the circulation to the public generally, to public officials and to suppliers and customers of the plaintiffs are false and malicious reports of and concerning the plaintiffs in their business of hauling freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.175" offset="1172041">And there were one or two other places where the same thing appeared, which I don't think I referred to you in reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.875" offset="1194924">And then finally, on the findings themselves, the specific findings, if you'll turn please to page 25, finding number 12, the bottom of the page, "On or about May 19, 1949, defendants other than Byoir, I may say here that there's another finding 14 which says Byoir came in to the later day, "acting through the ERPC, as Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference, combined then conspired with the intent and for the purpose and objective of eliminating truck operators including plaintiff trucking companies from the long-haul of transportation of freight and interstate commerce and the eastern territory and monopolizing that portion of interstate transportation in commerce for defendant railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.919" offset="1399097">And on page 27, number 20, the third-person technique was adopted by defendant so as the public, including governmental officials, would not be able properly to evaluate their propaganda thus disseminated and in order to achieve for it, wider distribution and more favorable reception.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.912" offset="1554996">It's not a basic finding such as those that I referred to but it does refer to one of the articles, which I think the Chief Justice may have inquired about yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.027" offset="1591463">And it's simply (Inaudible) perhaps 10 or 15 which covers specific types of material within volume 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.808" offset="1622601">Defendant has also caused to be published in national magazines and other publications, articles by our extensively independent authors, again, repeating the anti-truck propaganda line of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.936" offset="1671084">Byoir prepared or participated substantially in the preparation of such articles and in their distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.913" offset="1703058">In connection of the railroad with such articles was concealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.877" offset="1718836">These articles included.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.424" offset="1725106">And the first one was the one referred to yesterday, "The Rape of our Roads," Frederick G. Brownell, Reader's Digest July 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.265" offset="1760423">Byoir, as the finding indicated, prepared it, got it -- gets -- prepares this article and get some place in magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.488" offset="1793337">And of course, the man whose name as I extensively signed to them gets the usual author's fee from the magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.114" offset="1819878">Now, finally on page 29, number 31, as part of their campaign, defendant's vilified long-haul truckers as Five Percenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.265" offset="1872436">Now, you remember that at or about the time that this campaign was going on, there were legislative investigations with regard to so-called influence on congressional and other governmental agencies here in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.370" offset="1920815">And the term Five Percenter had come in to popular acceptance as a term of Odium at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.835" offset="1946728">Now, they applied that term and their own interoffice memoranda indicate that this was done deliberately and for the purpose of associating with us and having carry over to the truckers who had nothing whatsoever to do with the legislative investigation, then going on underway or the practice of it -- in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.439" offset="2021125">The same term of public disrepute, Five Percenters and the reason was their justification among themselves was that 5% of the trucking industry was composed of the long-haul truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.333" offset="2072743">And that Court continues which connoted fixers and characterized truck operators as evil, sinister, wrongdoers and villains and all --</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>

            <text syncTime="504.570" offset="2121644">That sir is page 29, finding number 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.756" offset="2142438">Now, these findings are not only based on what you saw by way of magazine material in -- in volume 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.878" offset="2182875">In addition to that, there was a tremendous amount of other written material.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.305" offset="2200639">They were literally thousands of pages, as my recollection, of testimony by people on the stand, their people whom we called for cross-examination as a result of which a good bit of this material was developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.220" offset="2252257">For example, they send people around regularly speaking to all sorts of service organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.745" offset="2274304">By that I mean the Rotary, Kiwanis and Lions and so on which are composed of businessmen who are natural customers of the truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.739" offset="2302307">And these people testified on the stand or those who sent them around testified as to the nature of a lot of other material other than these magazine articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.253" offset="2336371">Everything in these magazine articles before any particular article was admitted into evidence was identified by a witness on the stand, either that he orally told what the connection was of Byoir and the railroads from the witness stand or there was a memorandum which he identified from his file which tied every one of these things in -- with the railroads and Byoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.078" offset="2427695">Now, these findings were all sustained by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.367" offset="2444831">As a matter of fact, no issue was even raised in the Court of Appeals as to whether they were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.381" offset="2468864">And as a matter of fact too, I think, it's clear from the record here, and I've gone over the questions presented two or three times both in the brief and in the original petition for certiorari here, that they're not challenged, they're not raised in the questions involved or the questions presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.054" offset="2539604">And those are the findings which are established the facts for this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.998" offset="2575339">Now, we think that the issue is not whether the Sherman Act applies to or covers a legislative campaign, although I indicated yesterday and I will later today that I think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.992" offset="2627375">But whether a conspiracy by the defendants to drive the plaintiffs out of a very important and vital segment of interstate commerce, namely, long-haul trucking and to monopolize it for themselves utilizing what Judge Clary called the "technique of the big lie," in which they actively misrepresent and deceive people as to their role in this campaign, where they seek to destroy the plaintiff's goodwill to alienate its customers is removed from the Sherman Act merely because the defendants also sought to achieve their purpose by procuring restrictive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.606" offset="2793827">The legislation I may say, not at the congressional level but at the state level and that is of some importance here, in order to increase the plaintiffs' expenses of doing business and the price of their service to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.563" offset="2849625">Now, the fact --</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold E. Kohn</label>
            <text syncTime="713.761" offset="2958399">Now, there are number of cases which we cite at page 16 and 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.923" offset="2991104">And at page 2 of our very short, supplemental brief, which hold that even if the main thrust of a conspiracy is to achieve monopoly or restriction by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.123" offset="3047842">But that does not prevent it being a violation of the Antitrust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.913" offset="3067068">And this is what Mr. Justice Harlan mentioned I think asked about yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.950" offset="3091205">In the Sisal Sales Corporation case at 274 US 268, practically the sole method whereby they sought to achieve their purpose was by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.730" offset="3138330">And this Court, I think, then speaking as a matter of fact to Mr. Justice McReynolds had no trouble whatsoever in concluding that that was a violation of the Antitrust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.485" offset="3177305">There are number of other cases, many in the lower courts, which hold the same thing on page 17, the basing page of the brief to which I just referred you.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.176" offset="3212100">There are number of cases in many circumstances, there's been one as a matter of fact, which was tried at some length and went to a great many procedure of step right here in the District of Columbia where a jury, just quite recently after the District Court and the Court of Appeals upheld that the complaint very much like our complaints stated the course of action, where the jury found for the plaintiffs and held that this was a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.105" offset="3307813">There are cases in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.251" offset="3320351">There are cases, a matter of fact one instituted by the United States Government itself and the Association of American Railroad's case in the District of Nebraska, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.029" offset="3359535">Your Honors are familiar with the Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers case where one, incidentally out of the allegation, was that the defendants in that case were doing just what was sought to be done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.916" offset="3411048">That case was disposed off by a consent decree, I think approved by Judge Holtzoff, just a few weeks ago in which one of the things that the defendants were enjoined from doing was engaging or employing any person to present in his own or as any persons other than defendants, the views of defendants concerning the enactment, amendment, repeal or rescission of any legislation or regulation affecting the defendant or from remunerating any person who without disclosing, either that he is presenting the views of defendant or that he is being remunerated by the defendant, makes representations to a legislative or regulatory body or who would be expressed or implied direction or requested defendant makes representations to any organization or association without making either such disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.074" offset="3603623">I think it was Mr. Winston for the Government the other day just before your Court sited the United States versus Borden case as a type of situation where the use of governmental or legislative regulation does constitute a violation of the antitrust laws where the purpose is to drive somebody else out of business or to monopolize a field of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.159" offset="3708008">Now, the background of the Act, I think it was to examine, indicates the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.240" offset="3728384">I think Mr. Justice Black in the South-Eastern Underwriters case pointed out that an organization, I think which was called the "wheel" was started by the farmers and people of that day because the trust and this was an antitrust case, not only were exercising economic power but they're exercising political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.617" offset="3813857">They were influencing the legislatures to the detriment of the people who had to be protected by the legislation which was enacted in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.010" offset="3847398">I think that fact that this Court has been mindful of the prevalence of legislative attempts to achieve monopoly as further indicated by the Socony-Vacuum case in which Mr. Justice Douglas wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.842" offset="3898702">And he pointed out that merely because you achieved your purpose to legislation does not exempt you from the antitrust laws and cited three or four types of specific exemption which Congress granted when it wanted to, to particular industries to proceed to do something through legislation or through state administrative practices, which otherwise would have been prohibited by the -- by the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.697" offset="4002147">You had a somewhat similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.196" offset="4012178">For example, in Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad where the railroads defended on the ground that, "Well, we're not doing anything which is in violation of the Sherman Act because we have to proceed through the Interstate Commerce Commission or the other appropriate regulatory commissions and how can a conspiracy or combination by us to get rates which those agencies must approve, and which must be reasonable because they wouldn't be approved if they weren't reasonable, how can that be a violation of the Sherman Act?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.112" offset="4127848">And the Court held that, while the rates maybe perfectly proper, the combination to eliminate the competition and to seek in incombination a rate free from the free play of competition which should precede the rate making process was itself a violative of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.905" offset="4206947">And in those instances, I say where congress has seemed fit to grant exemptions to the Sherman Act, as in the Bullwinkle Act, as in the Insurance Act and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.699" offset="4242160">Congress has done so, but it's been manifested throughout, from the very beginning, in the -- in the original Trans-Missouri Railroad cases, which were among the first cases to come up under the Antitrust Acts involving the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.104" offset="4299839">That they fully con -- contemplated, that regardless of the means if you sought to achieve the purpose of your conspiracy, if your purpose was to monopolize or to restrict that that was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.688" offset="4346128">Mr. Justice Harlan, I think, in the Northern Securities case, very clearly went into this problem and -- and pointed out that, in that case, similar to the case that we have here where the State of New Jersey had purported to permit the creation of certain trust which were -- by trust I mean large organizations controlling other companies and so on which were illegal under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.899" offset="4466918">It was first pointed out that the State of New Jersey, such as here, had no reason to suspect that those who are taking advantage of its liberal and corporation laws had in view the purpose of destroying commerce and then the Court continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.884" offset="4526895">And I just want to read briefly a line or two stating that, "No device invasion of the provisions of the antitrust laws, however skillfully such device may have been contrived, then no combination by whomsoever form is beyond the reach of the supreme law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.801" offset="4606621">If such device or combination by its operation directly restrains commerce, then later on while every instrumentality of domestic commerce is subject to state control, every instrumentality of interstate commerce may be reached and controlled by national authority, so far to compel it to respect the rules for such commerce lawfully established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.676" offset="4702124">No corporate person can excuse the departure from or violation of that rule under the plea that that which it has done or omitted to be done is permitted or not for -- forbidden by the state under whose authority had came into existence."</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.540" offset="4757504">We repeat that no state can endow any of its corporations or any combinations of its citizens with authority to restrain interstate or international commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.328" offset="5420701">The testimony was and this is testimony on the case that they have very slight regard to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.475" offset="5441285">They're sort of like traffic violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.109" offset="5475767">The railroads themselves had been through the same problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.284" offset="5488515">The Willard Committee of the United States Senate had exposed in the 1940, a very similar type of campaign in other areas and that too is in the record below, in which they had done much the same practices in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.798" offset="5542536">Now first of all as to the misrepresentations, basically, we think -- and there's one real type of misrepresentation that they misrepresented the source of the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.047" offset="5587571">Who was paying for, who was sponsoring and who was behind and then what the motives were?</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.937" offset="5603140">They actually created organizations which had no other purpose, no other function except to distribute their material on the names which were wholly misleading like they set one up called the Empire State Transportation lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.139" offset="5663953">They reactivated and financed a lot of organization to which had been dormant like the New Jersey Automobile owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.915" offset="5691016">And the New Jersey automobile owners was the one and who is named extensively a man was going throughout New Jersey and Pennsylvania and elsewhere making speeches to Rotary, Kiwanis and so on about the damage of the trucks we're doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.775" offset="5738454">They used existing organizations like the Township Supervisors in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.084" offset="5759666">And I think Mr. Justice Brennan referred to yesterday, where they published in the name of the Township Supervisors and ad, which have been and been paid for by the Township Superviders -- Supervisors organization would have been a plain violation of the Pennsylvania statutes which forbid this organization to use its money for any of such purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.530" offset="5849527">And the ad was placed, composed, run everything else by Byoir and paid for by The Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.307" offset="5876590">They had a television program which they ran in the name of the grange, where once again, it was a plain violation of the Federal Communications Act which said that in a program of that type you have to put -- you have to announce who the real sponsor is, who is the advertiser, or who is the sponsor paying for the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.901" offset="5950986">Nowhere that it appeared to the Railroads, in this program were the actual sponsors and this program was put out in the name of the grange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.079" offset="5979721">Then, there were more specific false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.063" offset="5999574">If I may epitomize the -- the subject of the dispute for just -- for just a moment, it's settled by the Maryland Road Test, I don't think that any dispute but regardless whether it's settled by the Maryland Road Test, the Maryland Road Test did prove this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.177" offset="6052028">That the important thing is not what the weight is in the truck altogether but how much weight is on each axle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.799" offset="6074598">It's like a man on snow shoes, 200 pounds, and go over snow but a 50-pound child, just wearing a child on shoes will -- will fall through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.850" offset="6110751">The important thing is, what it is the load on each axle and second what is the subsurface of the road, because as you've seen, sidewalks subjected only the ordinary pedestrian traffic will crack if the subsurface is not properly prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.010" offset="6179401">Now, they represented that this test had shown that the overall weight was the important thing in damaging roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.263" offset="6216391">Now, this was particularly important in Pennsylvania where there was a bill pending which would have increased the weight but decrease the axle load limit to the benefit of the truckers, to the benefit of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.321" offset="6268635">In other words, the truckers could have carried more cheaply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.505" offset="6281383">The roads would have been subject to actually to less damage and the public would have gotten services more cheaply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.241" offset="6304371">They defeated that bill by misrepresentation of this Maryland Road Test saying that it had shown that the increased weight that we wanted was what would damage the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.569" offset="6345644">Now actually, there was on the witness stand in this case, a former secretary of Highway of Pennsylvania who had transmitted a report to the Governor, the Governor's office upon which great reliance was placed by the Governor and be telling this measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.871" offset="6410846">That man on the witness stand still at that late date did not know that the report which had come to him from one of his subordinates had been prepared and written word for word by Byoir people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.272" offset="6464449">We asked him several times and he said, "Well, it seems to have the style of my subordinates so I just -- I assumed, I -- I felt safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.377" offset="6496841">It was prepared by -- by my people in my department."</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.451" offset="6513142">And it was admitted on the record and there's no doubt about this that that report was prepared word for word by the Byoir people containing this sort of misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.829" offset="6546683">The same thing was done with a Federal Bureau of Roads film, which was shown in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.447" offset="6569148">We showed the original film as it was prepared by the Bureau of Roads and then we showed the film as it was put out by some organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.073" offset="6611675">I've forgotten the exact name of it which put this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.172" offset="6632051">And the head of the Bureau of Roads was in the courtroom and he expressed the opinion that it was not the same or substantially the same as the film which he had originally edited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.459" offset="6681161">They prepared televisions scripts, radio scripts, which portrayed all truckers as -- I think their phrase was relating to evil, sinister, wrongdoers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.516" offset="6717419">They'd cast them as heavy and villain, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.679" offset="6738108">They've prepared accident pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.931" offset="6747094">No matter how a truck happened to be in an accident, whether it was the truck's fault or anybody else's fault, that picture was kept in a file and then circulated around as if it was the truck that was responsible for every one of these accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.348" offset="6804773">And they did this through news agencies, syndicating agencies which appeared to be independent news agencies, syndicating agencies, but they're actually owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.116" offset="6855868">We find later a lock, stock empowered by Byoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.094" offset="6867780">There was one called the Central States News Views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.784" offset="6882513">First, they started out a -- remember the text yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.605" offset="6897768">If you look at page 559 (b) of volume 4, they have a young lady called Ms. (Inaudible) of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.315" offset="6940609">And right below her is a road all smashed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.067" offset="6951685">Then they have Ms. Plunging Neckline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.359" offset="6960776">They showed a truck which is bogged down on a muddy road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.857" offset="6978748">Then they continue that sort of thing through 561 (b) where Byoir has distributed, this time to another syndicate called SC syndicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.088" offset="7015737">This horrendous series of pictures, truck terror time and one truck accident every 10 minutes and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.478" offset="7049279">And pictures of automobile -- truck accidents which nobody endeavored to prove and nobody could prove in any of instances were caused by the trucks and which gave a completely misleading picture when circulated in myth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.570" offset="7105703">And their office memoranda indicated that they circulated literally thousands and tens of thousands of pieces of materials of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.819" offset="7142693">Now, if I have just a word about the scope of this injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.946" offset="7159202">I would call your attention to once again volume 4, which we had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.462" offset="7189191">First, at page 164, at the bottom of that page, you will see that whatever is contained in this injunction had application only if two facts first occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.626" offset="7257840">First, the only thing that's prohibited is what they do in combination or conspiracy and secondly for the purpose of driving us, as driving the truckers out of business or severely restricting truck competition, as to the bottom of 164, the top of 165 of volume 4 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.291" offset="7344567">Then you see that the Court even went further at 166, in item number 9 in protecting the rights of the plaintiffs by pointing out that the only sponsoring instigation or support of legislation, which was prohibited, was that where -- or rather putting it the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.863" offset="7430875">It was prohibited unless their opposition be openly and publicly made in the name of the defendants or any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.404" offset="7460968">In other words, if they came out and stood up and were willing to be counted, would give their names then they could ask for this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.575" offset="7485628">If they didn't, then it was prohibited in the context of this case and finally in Article V, Roman numeral five of the injunction on 166, the Court said that they can ask for legislative, administrative or other governmental benefits for themselves in any manner and that where the plaintiffs were asking for legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.083" offset="7571728">They could oppose such legislation by appearing before the legislative, administrative or other governmental body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.542" offset="7605582">So the only thing they're prohibited from doing so far as legislation is concerned, is combining to put it out of business by seeking legislation in this so-called third party technique or not for attribution or big lie manner, everything else they can do by way of seeking legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.621" offset="11373902">I should like to begin my reply by observing that since this is a Sherman Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.807" offset="11398562">The basic question here is whether the petitioners combined and conspired to restrain trade, and I should like to emphasize that the question is not whether the petitioners did something wrong or immoral or against public policy or even may perhaps have violated some statute other than the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.391" offset="11508903">The question is, whether they combined and conspired to restrain trade?</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.406" offset="11528965">Now, the Sherman Act is a statute that is directed at certain specified economic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.178" offset="11560103">So I suggest that what we should, is the -- with the court's permission to consider it, is what the economic consequences were to which this concerted action of the petitioner was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.002" offset="11619349">Now, it is our position that these public relations campaign which the petitioners engaged in was wholly legislative or governmental in its purposes and in its effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.877" offset="11686849">What they were doing was trying to get the state legislature to pass laws that would admittedly limit, cripple the competitive power of the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.906" offset="11742960">Now, we say that that kind of a restraint, a restraint imposed by valid state actions, admittedly valid here is not an unlawful restraint or monopolization within the meaning of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.691" offset="11802102">We also suggest that it doesn't make any difference for the purposes of that proposition what means or methods you use to get State to take that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.723" offset="11850271">They maybe wrong and they maybe unlawful under other statutes but they do not violate the Sherman Act because it restraint itself which the State imposes, does not violate the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.684" offset="12014111">True, one phase of the activity was of the legislatures -- legislative nature but a rather new approach to legislations they believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.172" offset="12048071">The other phase and the more important one of the campaign accepted, your doubt is familiar with it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh B. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2991.031" offset="12067506">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.830" offset="12070640">I was -- in fact that the point of dealing with the contention which is based on what the lower court and the District Court said that this campaign was not wholly legislative in its purposes and effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.428" offset="12133125">Now, what the District Court held in that passage in elsewhere was that this campaign although admittedly legislative in large part was accompanied by a purpose to injure the good will of the trucking industry and that it had the effect of injury in the good will of the trucking industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.458" offset="12221210">Now, I should like to submit that the District Court's own language on what it meant by good will shows what is essentially wrong with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.058" offset="12267604">There is a passage in Volume 4 of the record at 105 where the District Court explains what it means by good will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.330" offset="12308668">It says when it's talking about injury of good will it means that it uses the word good will in two senses, first, in the sense of loss of business, loss of truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.787" offset="12370526">Now, I like to stop and deal if I may with that aspect of the alleged impact and purpose of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.908" offset="12406993">There isn't a scrap of evidence in this record, not a scrap and the respondent's brief and in his -- respondent's argument that we refer to any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.265" offset="12456417">There isn't a scrap of evidence that any single trucker or the trucking industry as a whole never lost a pound of traffic as a result of this public relations campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.700" offset="12502183">There is proof that they lost some traffic that they might have had if the Governor of Pennsylvania hadn't decode a bill, but there isn't any proof that the public relations campaign ever caused them to loss any traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.942" offset="12555160">They have not pointed to any piece of publicity and I -- it was all in my understanding that all of the publicities are here in which the petitioners say -- which was addressed to the shippers and which said the shippers don't ship by trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.896" offset="12619003">We mustn't ship by trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.273" offset="12624436">Stay away from the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.682" offset="12630079">This publicity is all directed to arguments about how much taxes the truck should pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.311" offset="12652648">How heavy -- what weight limit should be imposed on them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.221" offset="12664247">Whether they injure the roads, whether if they are on the bridges?</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.421" offset="12677099">That's what this publicity is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.565" offset="12685667">So I say that you cannot predicate liability in this case where you cannot find the restrain of trade in this case or a purpose to restrain trade in this case on this first definition of good will because there simply isn't any evidence to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.390" offset="12744913">And by the way to make it perfectly clear, we raised in the -- in the first and the third questions presented the correctness of these conclusions that the District Court as to the purpose and the impact of this public relations campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.786" offset="12798516">I think there is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.911" offset="12806980">We -- we attacked those conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.514" offset="12817429">They say that they are clearly wrong and one on the -- the lawsuit, a business is clearly wrong, not in the sense that -- as a preponderance of evidence against it or that there -- there is some evidence to support you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.528" offset="12869465">It's wrong in the sense that's just isn't any evidence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.657" offset="12890049">Now, this Court demonstrated, it was talking about good will in a second sense and this I think is particularly interesting, it's baring on what the Court was really talking about in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.772" offset="12934457">It said that it was talking about injury to good will in the sense that the petitioners brought the respondents of trucking industry into discredit, discredit that done in the eyes of the public, and thus, removing the likelihood that the truckers could gain public support and appreciation and sympathy which the Court said would be essential to avoid the imposition of crippling burdens and restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.437" offset="13057128">It seems I think without any doubt that that last finding of conclusion of the Court expects the good will, speaking of good will in the legislative sense, it couldn't have meant anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.613" offset="13105821">The imposition of crippling burdens of restrictions was purely key to all the evidence in this case about the state legislation which the truckers were seeking or which the petitioners were seeking to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.302" offset="13160573">So that -- I would say furthermore, in response to your question about these conclusions that in our brief, we have made -- it's not very long but it's a detailed analysis of the particularized findings of the District Court as opposed to its general conclusions and of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.111" offset="13243852">And we submit that when that is examined, it appears both from the particularized findings and from the evidence that this campaign was wholly legislative in its purposes and its effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.424" offset="13301112">The evidence, the best evidence about purpose in the record is the documents which the petitioners and the public relations agent wrote at the beginning of the campaign when it was being planned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.983" offset="13347297">Those are the kind of documents that are always used in the antitrust case to prove purposes and they are usually very effective for that the reason that they are contemporaneous and these documents which the District Court made some particularized findings about which are consistent with what I have to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.902" offset="13415006">The documents in themselves show that this campaign was a legislative campaign and that Byoir was detained because Byoir had had a great deal of experience in legislative method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.691" offset="13466102">The District Court himself after he finished describing what he call the campaign of vilification, in a very interesting passage which we've quoted in our brief said, "The cap of the pyramid in each State was legislation" and then it goes on in that passage to specify the various kinds of legislation which this campaign was designed to get -- which it did get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.637" offset="13585951">So that -- we submit that -- that this real issue in this case and I noticed by the way that the greater part of respondent's argument was devoted to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.647" offset="13633912">The real issue in this case is whether if men act in concert to get a state government to impose restrictions on their competitors which will creepily competitive power of their competitors, that action in concert violates the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.895" offset="13714996">Now, I think I have stated our basic position on that earlier when I said that since the restraint, the economic consequence which that action produces is itself lawful and lawful under the -- the Constitution of this country for all purposes if it's valid and they admit this legislation here involved and valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.492" offset="13801305">If it's lawful for all purposes, then the economic consequences it produces cannot be unlawful restraints and monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.916" offset="13835055">And if the consequence is not unlawful, surely the purpose to achieve that consequence is not an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.275" offset="13872462">I might add to the part from that argument which I think stands on its own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.203" offset="13892211">I should like to merely observe in passing that if you hold that that kind of consorted action does violate the antitrust laws, it seems to me the Court is faced with a problem of inquiring into the reasons and motives for the legislative action by the States, because the Sherman Act is a statute that does require some causative showing as between the activities of the alleged conspirators and the economic consequence the -- the statute prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.028" offset="14023450">And I also observe that ever since Fletcher against Peck, this Court and all the federal court, most state courts have been most reluctant in most -- most cases declined to enter into kind of inquiry about legislative reasons and legislative motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.398" offset="14100982">I should now like to come back to the point, deal with it more specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.972" offset="14127208">Before I do that, may I say this, that there were brief many cases that are referred to this morning by counsel on this question of whether you violate the antitrust laws by combining to get to govern -- valid governmental action that helps you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.014" offset="14187395">I think I can say that I didn't seem to meet any of those cases had any bearing on this -- this question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.110" offset="14219786">Those cases in my judgment all represent situations where the alleged restraint or monopolization was an -- was a restraint or monopolization that was imposed or occurred apart from governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.395" offset="14272972">Now, of course if you have a restraint of that kind and you helped to bring it about, not by the governmental action but by something you do in relation to the Government, that is a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.906" offset="14323022">But, in case like the Georgia case where the real question was whether consorted action not subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission was subject to the antitrust laws, that kind of a case which -- where the -- where the restraint was imposed outside of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.649" offset="14393971">That's what this Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.326" offset="14400658">That case has nothing to do with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.017" offset="14415391">Our counsel referred to the Borden case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.284" offset="14424482">I do the indictment of the Borden case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.461" offset="14433259">I think I know something about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.966" offset="14439215">It wasn't tried on merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.861" offset="14446843">The allegation in the Borden case was that certain Government officials in Chicago in willful disregard and disobedience of their statutory duties had joined the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.000" offset="14495326">Well, that's a very different thing from a case in which you are alleged and that are restraint imposed by a state action in an unlawful monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.685" offset="14526151">That was a case where people went outside their official duties and became private really they exercise their private rights joining the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.305" offset="14564603">I can't -- I don't have time to talk about all of those cases but I honestly suggest that when the cases were examined, that they do not bear on his problem, they are cases which we have cited in our brief, Parker against Brown, the California case, the Rock Royal case, American Banana case, Olsen against Smith, which we think taken together, support the argument on principle that I have made this morning to the effect that state action no matter how induced, does not produce an unlawful -- if valid, does not produce an unlawful restraint or monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.020" offset="14723427">Now, I should like to devote the rest of my time to a discussion to a -- the -- what relevance there is in this case to the fact that the Railroads did not disclose the source which is quite true in this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.505" offset="14797406">Now, I submit that the argument is based on that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.448" offset="14817155">It seems to me they rest on a misapprehension about carry through the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.846" offset="14834709">I come back to my basic proposition that it's an act to deal with certain economic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.874" offset="14862817">The economic consequences were here, were to be achieved by state action which is conceded to have been valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.512" offset="14889462">Now, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.521" offset="14893432">It doesn't make any difference if you didn't disclose the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.046" offset="14907538">I think it might have been wrong not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.656" offset="14914017">I'm not condoning what was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.401" offset="14924988">Judge Biggs in the Circuit Court who dissented was shocked by what -- both the truckers and the railroads had done, but that is really irrelevant to the purpose of deciding whether a third-party technique itself restraints trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.194" offset="14984129">Now, our position on that is that since the technique was used to induce valid governmental action and that action doesn't restrain trade with the use of the technique is really irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.722" offset="15038255">I think that our position is the same with the respect to the truth or falsity of the arguments that were made by the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.236" offset="15076289">We don't concede that the -- that these arguments were false and in the District Court, the petitioners offered to prove that what they said about trucks injuring bridges and roads and what they said about the Maryland road test and what they said about trucks not paying their fair share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.662" offset="15158000">The tax is needed to maintain roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.233" offset="15168345">They offered to put in material -- try to put in material to prove that those facts or opinions were true and the District Court excluded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.068" offset="15207633">The offer to the proof were in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.306" offset="15220590">It was excluded on the ground that it was irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3810.858" offset="15346813">The District Court did allow some times that prove him -- which had some bearing on this question of truth for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.952" offset="15383176">He allowed the railroads to introduce stipulated material which showed that these respondents in his case in a three or four-year period had violated the overweight regulation sustained about 3000 times, which was of course proved to justify what have been said in the publicity about trucks frequently operating over the weight limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.825" offset="15474709">But when the respondent -- the petitioners tried to put in proof about how roads are built and how many -- what part of the roads in the -- in the eastern part of United States are constructed on the kind of subsoil or in the way which will enable them to stand up to heavy trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.201" offset="15544195">The judge said, "That's all irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.958" offset="15551195">And I'm not going to admit it into evidence."</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.887" offset="15562898">Now, I think -- I can't -- I don't I should try to explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.292" offset="15588498">But our position does not depend on the truth what was said here because it is our position again, that since what the petitioners were seeking to do in this case was to induce valid state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.634" offset="15661955">Then the fact that in expressing these opinions or they are making these arguments they may -- they did not assumed that they didn't speak the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.299" offset="15696541">The fact still remains that that does not change the character of the restraint which was involved, which was a lawful restraint intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.353" offset="15736769">Their actions were indirect to restraint and the restraint was imposed into a lawful restraint and the character of the restraint is not changed by the character of the methods that the petitioners may be assumed to abused in attempting to persuade the State between (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.610" offset="15829765">I should --</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.714" offset="15886190">There is one further point that I should like to make in relation to the character of this case, and that has to do with the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.454" offset="15953168">Now, both Mr. Price and the counsel for respondents have discussed the injunction and I should prefer not to take the Court throughout in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.860" offset="15994859">But I should like to make this point to the Court that if there is any doubt that this case is about legislative effort and about the public debate and discussion of issues, the public policy, that doubt is removed by the terms of the injunction because the injunction by its terms is not in any material sense directed to commercial practices or the things that are specifically directed to the trucker's customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.562" offset="16125576">Let's say the injunction which is cast in broad terms, is directed to public debate and discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.695" offset="16158177">It prohibits for example the -- Mr. Price pointed, the petitioners in concert, from saying anything that is -- that may create -- present mother hostility to the truckers, irrespective of whether it's true in those provisions of the injunction, irrespective of whether it has to do with the legislative proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.774" offset="16234454">It does enjoin the petitioners from seeking legislation, maybe beneficial to them or crippling to the truckers and I think Mr. Kohn does not misunderstand that subparagraph 9 because subparagraph 9 by its terms says that you -- the petitioners can't seek legislation which should -- is designed to impose weight limitations or taxes or anything that kind, irrespective whether they use a third-party technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.365" offset="16360782">The third-party technique qualification implies to the opposing part -- clause of the -- by its terms which is the last clause in subparagraph 9, but that doesn't -- that's not the point which I'm trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.001" offset="16415326">Now, I'm -- the point I'm making is that this is a legislative case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.922" offset="16431104">It is a public debate and discussion case and you can't -- you can't cure this injunction by trying to regret it because the injunction exactly and precisely mirrors the caue of action here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4114.849" offset="16562761">The -- the injunction is significant because of our judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.877" offset="16578853">It shows what's wrong with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.964" offset="16591182">It is a case in which an attempt has been made to apply the Sherman Act in an area, not of commercial practices, coercive, restrictive, noncompetitive.</text>
