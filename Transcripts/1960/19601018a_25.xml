            <text syncTime="13.522" offset="157445">Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.928" offset="183045">I believe it will be possible for me to be rather brief in my presentation because I think the issue is pretty clear and a pretty concise one, and there is no material dispute as far as the facts are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.173" offset="260054">The petitioner, a 60-year-old native of Greece, was naturalized in 1942 and, later, in 1952, because of this prior admission of membership in the Communist Party during the early years, his naturalization was cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.507" offset="361409">It was cancelled upon the grounds that it was fraudulently obtained, in that, he had not disclosed to the naturalizing court the fact that he had been a member of the Communist Party within 10 years prior to his naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.194" offset="432149">The District Court ruled that the question number 28 in his petition for naturalization which was addressed to the question of whether he belonged to any organization that advocated our position to organize Government should have been interpreted by him as a question calling for his admission or denial of Communist Party membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.481" offset="533295">That was the basis for the finding of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.949" offset="551163">The Court also ruled that his naturalization had been illegally procured because, as a member of the Communist Party, he was a member of an organization which made him ineligible for membership, in that, under the 1940 Act, Congress had amended the 1906 Act so as to provide that teaching or advocating a membership in any organization which teaches or advocates the violent overthrow of the government should bar naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.331" offset="712704">There was nothing, of course, in the 1940 Act relating to Communist Party membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.839" offset="734751">The court, moreover, concluded that it was not necessary to prove that the petitioner actually knew the Communist Party as an organization that engaged in illegal teaching and advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.742" offset="778324">That knowledge was of no significance, that the mere fact that he was a member of the Communist Party plus evidence that the Communist Party itself engaged in such teaching and advocacy was sufficient to bar him from citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.209" offset="848227">The petitioner took an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.137" offset="871946">He was represented on that appeal by my office.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.516" offset="889396">His case was one of approximately six cases of denaturalization that followed essentially the same pattern, the same charges, the same type of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.533" offset="933491">At the time his case was appealed, there was pending, in our Sixth Circuit, three denaturalization cases, the Chomiak case, the Charnowola case, and the Sweet case each of which are referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.158" offset="995976">And each of those cases, the identical issues that have been raised and litigated in petitioner's case were likewise raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.446" offset="1209135">The Government upholds that our request for an extension of time, nevertheless, the Court of Appeals gave us that extension conditioned upon our filing the brief within 30 days after this Court's action in Sweet, Chomiak, and Charnowola cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.686" offset="1270157">This Court denied certiorari in the last three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.144" offset="1291995">It may be that we, as counsel for petitioner, did him an injustice by doing what, I am persuaded, every other member of the bar of this Court has done and every other District Court judge and many Circuit Court judges have done and, that is, to read into a denial of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.987" offset="1367333">Some indication that, of course, this Court has said on several occasions should not be read into such a denial.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.044" offset="2183502">And, that was the primary issue that prompted us, first, to petition for certiorari in Nowak and Maisenberg, and I'm informed that it was the major issue that was discussed at the time of the oral argument in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.240" offset="2240345">I mentioned that only parenthetically to indicate that there were some justification for coming to the Court in Nowak and Maisenberg that, in our opinion, did not exist before.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.725" offset="2282245">Now, following this Court's decision in Nowak and Maisenberg, we became satisfied that the judgment of denaturalization against Polites was clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.328" offset="2328639">We, therefore, filed with the District Court a motion, under Rule 60 (b) (5) and (6), asking that that judgment be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.038" offset="2371480">Among other things, we not only pointed out why we thought the judgment of denaturalization was erroneous, but we pointed out that the Government was trying to take advantage of that erroneous judgment by now regarding the petitioner as an alien and seeking his deportation to Greece and his separation from his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.986" offset="2447339">That was the gist of our motion to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.189" offset="2468133">The Government filed no document in opposition to the motion, certainly, no pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.123" offset="2491852">They did file a memorandum of law in opposition to the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.779" offset="2510451">The District Court, after discussing generally the impact of Nowak and Maisenberg upon Polites, finally decided that it lacked power to grant the relief that we sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.761" offset="2574399">I believe that, therein, we have the primary issue that is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.447" offset="2601148">The District Court, in our case, did not pass on the merits whether or not granted it has the power it should grant this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.209" offset="2644198">It said, "We understand the law to be that once you start an appeal and you dismiss that appeal, you cannot then come to the District Court under Rule 60 (b) and ask for relief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="648.965" offset="2699264">Now, it is our contention that that is not the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.019" offset="2747434">At the time of the recess, I have stated what I consider to be the central theme of my argument that what is involved here is a question of the power of the District Court under Rule 60 (b) (5) or (6) and not whether or not that power has been properly exercised under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.468" offset="2837295">I would buttress that by quoting from what the District Court judge actually said at the conclusion of his -- or near the conclusion of his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.447" offset="2877210">I'm quoting from page 26 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.636" offset="2889958">He said "therefore, since petitioner abandoned his appeal, as he states, because of the controlling decisions in Chomiak, Sweet, and Charnowola, we have absolutely no alternative but to follow the Ackermann decision coupled with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals' statement in Berryhill versus United States which refutes petitioner's reasoning by saying, "It appears to be the subtle law that a change in the judicial view of the applicable law, after a final judgment, is not a basis for vacating a judgment entered before announcement of the change.”</text>

            <text syncTime="736.232" offset="3048260">I was reading from page 26 and 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.995" offset="3067382">And then, the District Court concluded his opinion with the following quotation which appears on page 11 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.562" offset="3105625">“Ordinarily, we would have granted petitioner's prayer, particularly under subsections (b) (5) of Rule 60, authorizing us to do so if it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.698" offset="3174170">But, in our opinion, our Court of Appeals specifically eliminates such holding where the only reason for abandoning the appeal was because of the then status of the law under the controlling decisions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="784.465" offset="3241253">I submit that it's apparent from that that the District Court did not reach the merits of petitioner's case under Rule 60 (b) and that, if I'm correct that this is a question of power then we need not come to the other question, whether or not the order of denaturalization in petitioner's case was actually erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.904" offset="3346996">I submit that it probably would be inappropriate for this Court to rule on that, since all of the facts in petitioner's case are not before this Court, since the District Court which is more cumbersome with the record in petitioner's case will have before it the opinion of this Court in Nowak and Maisenberg and can make that initial determination for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.503" offset="3433409">I submit further, however, that if the District Court came to the conclusion that its judgment of denaturalization was erroneous, that would be one element to be considered by the District Court in deciding whether relief should be granted under Rules 60 (b) (5) or (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="851.027" offset="3507493">I do not argue that that element would be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.300" offset="3520554">It would however, be a consideration that I think should influence, to some extent the District Court in deciding whether to grant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.993" offset="3555349">Again, I do not think it is necessary for this Court to deciding whether or not petitioner was justified in dismissing his appeal in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.283" offset="3600488">There again, I submit that that is an additional element that would or would not influence the District Court in exercising its discretion if it got to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.030" offset="3647509">Now, the Government argues and I might say before I go into that that I have been able to find only two decisions in this Court dealing with Rule 60 (b) (5) and (6) and I don't think the Government relies on any others that's the Klapprott case -- Klapprott against United States which is cited in both briefs and the Ackermann case which likewise is cited in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.633" offset="3757955">In Ackermann, on which the Government places primary reliance, the District Court there did not say, "I do not have power to grant the relief."</text>
            <text syncTime="926.065" offset="3807587">The District Court said "I am denying your motion on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.451" offset="3825142">I have considered all of these extenuating circumstances that you present, and I am not persuaded, in the exercise of my discretion, that I should vacate the judgment."</text>
            <text syncTime="940.926" offset="3867042">And, all that this Court said was, "We find no basis for disturbing the discretion exercised by the District Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="948.891" offset="3898911">So, Ackermann does not go to the question of jurisdiction on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.020" offset="3919496">By necessary implication, I would submit that Ackermann holds that the District Court did have jurisdiction in the sense of power to grant the relief prayed for by the petitioner there and by analogy that the District Court, in Polites case, had jurisdiction in the sense of power to grant the relief prayed by Polites.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.994" offset="4003297">Now, Klapprott, I believe, might be interpreted as actually going to the question of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.760" offset="4030464">There, the petitioner alleged, among other things, that he was imprisoned at the time of his denaturalization proceedings that, through a various unfortunate circumstances, he was prevented from defending his case and, as a result, he was denaturalized by means of a default judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.852" offset="4102771">This Court considered his petition and, among other things, this Court ruled that Rule 60 (b) was intended to give very liberal power to the District Courts to correct manifest injustices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.264" offset="4176436">That ,among other things, it was intended to eliminate some of the restrictions that had been placed upon District Courts in vacating or changing judgments at the expiration of a term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.088" offset="4219695">So that Rule 60 (b) is not, for example, comparable to a bill of review or a bill in the nature of review and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.026" offset="4247489">It goes beyond even those liberal rules that were devised by the old common law -- or the old equity courts, rather, to take care of this case of what happens where a judgment, in its prospective effect, has unfortunate consequences from which the person should be relieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.732" offset="4322304">The court, among other things, in Ackermann decided that, there, the petition had set up sufficient facts which, if true, would warrant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.160" offset="4363995">Accordingly, this Court remanded the case to the District Court to do what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.708" offset="4382177">To frame the issue, to take testimony on whether or not this was a case of extraordinary circumstances warranting the use of Rule 60 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.674" offset="4430033">To that extent, this Court has held, I contend, in Kalpprott that the District Court here in Polites had power, had jurisdiction to do what we have requested should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.873" offset="4482905">Now, of course, all of us are concerned about the finality of judgments and the Government makes the big argument that if this can happen in Polites case, then it's rather difficult to conceive of any situation where judgment of denaturalization becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.273" offset="4568482">I don't experience any difficulty with that argument because I think the whole judicial process is one of balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.606" offset="4597844">Here, we have to balance what petitioner contends is an obvious injustice that results to him based upon an erroneous judgment against the desire to maintain stability of judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.369" offset="4648835">And, I think, in that very balancing process, we are doing what the District Court here has declined to do because the District Court has declined to enter into that balancing process by not actually accepting jurisdiction in getting to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.925" offset="4715081">I could, of course, prolong this argument by going into a differentiation of the various cases cited by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.840" offset="4742771">I think, however, that a simple reading of those cases will indicate that they're distinguishable on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.564" offset="4765654">I would, however, call attention to the Sunal case which is primarily relied upon by the Government and is cited in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.898" offset="4798986">Sunal, I believe, it's called, against Large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.370" offset="4820825">That case was a case where this Court, after denying certiorari, subsequently granted certiorari and, in effect, changed the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.450" offset="4869204">Sunal was charged with failing to report for induction into the Armed Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.098" offset="4895744">Among other things, he contended that he was improperly classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.202" offset="4916224">The District Court ruled, relying upon prior decisions, that the defense of improper classification could not be made at the time of trial, that it had been administratively determined and that was the end to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.334" offset="4968678">Sunal was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.772" offset="4974425">He did not take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.002" offset="4983411">A similar situation, a companion case, was the Kulick case that happened in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.609" offset="5005772">Subsequent to these convictions, this Court ruled that the defense of improper classification could be asserted at the time of the trial for the main offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.690" offset="5054151">Sunal then made application not under Rule 60 (b) but by petition for habeas corpus to have his conviction set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.491" offset="5105351">This Court divided on that issue but the majority opinion concluded that there was not sufficient justification shown for setting aside the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.501" offset="5145370">I'm primarily concerned, however, with the rule that was announced by the majority in that case, and I quote that rule, it was as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.856" offset="5182777">“The rule which requires resort to appellate procedure for the correction of errors is not one defining power but one which relates to the appropriate exercise of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.309" offset="5240560">That rule is, therefore, not so inflexible that it may not yield to exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.013" offset="5291447">I submit that the same considerations should control in applying Rule 60 (b) (5) or (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and that, in its very nature, the District Court is in the most advantageous position to determine whether or not the injustice which the petitioner allegedly will suffer, by giving prospective effect to the judgment or by continuing an operation of judgment which he thinks or which the District Court finds have been erroneous outweighs the desirability of maintaining the stability of judgments and it is upon --</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.698" offset="6398203">It would mean that no controversy could ever be regarded as ultimately settled and that an unsuccessful litigant would have a right at any time in the future to reopen the case when he deemed to be time propitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.160" offset="6468002">Now, in this case, the facts are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.290" offset="6480541">A denaturalization suit was brought against Mr. Polites 10 years after his naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.450" offset="6509171">The suit was commenced in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.613" offset="6521814">A trial took place in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.185" offset="6536129">The trial covered four days and, at that trial, Polites was represented by his present counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.476" offset="6569253">At the conclusion of the trial, Judge Picard of the District Court of Detroit found that the naturalization had been fraudulently and illegally procured, and he ordered the denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.108" offset="6635813">Now, Polites then filed an appeal, but he never completed that appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.858" offset="6662771">Instead, as Mr. Crockett has said, he, first, obtained from the Court of Appeals an extension of his time in which to file briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.368" offset="6696835">And, this was done because the Court of Appeals then had under consideration, three cases involving similar issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.151" offset="6731943">One was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.173" offset="6736018">The others were similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.713" offset="6746258">In the -- in the Chomiak case, the issue was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.526" offset="6761514">In the others, the issues were similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.479" offset="6769246">The others claimed only fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.472" offset="6781262">Chomiak -- they may have claimed both fraud and illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.287" offset="6796518">Cromi -- Chomiak was decided only on the issue of illegality based on Section 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.276" offset="6820446">They were quite similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.162" offset="6827969">Then, when Chomiak, Charnowola, and Sweet lost in the Court of Appeals, they applied for certiorari and certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.075" offset="6867675">At that time, petitioner's counsel who re -- also represented Sweet, Chomiak, and Charnowola voluntarily stipulated to dismiss the appeal of Polites with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.067" offset="6939669">This was the language of the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.703" offset="6950222">And the Court of Appeals, in November of 1954, entered an order on that stipulation, dismissing the appeal with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.505" offset="6993377">That, again, was the language of the order of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.010" offset="7011453">And then, deportation proceedings followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.993" offset="7023365">The deportation order was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.669" offset="7034023">A judicial review to the deportation order was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.548" offset="7049592">And, while the proceedings for judicial review of the deportation order were pending, Polites brought this motion to reopen the 1953 judgment, to reopen it because, as he said, the decisions of this Court in Nowak and Maisenberg had changed the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.072" offset="7139662">Now, this motion, Your Honors, was brought five years after the original judgment and four years after plaintiff, through his -- petitioner, through his counsel, had voluntarily stipulated to abandon his appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.223" offset="7320221">Our answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.033" offset="7323460">We have three facets of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.863" offset="7334849">In the first place, after an order has become final, a judgment has become final, we believe that the Rule 60 (b) itself in its historical context, in the light of everything that went before, in the light of every adjudication on the rule, precludes reopening of the judgment merely because the party thinks that he'd have a better chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.239" offset="7428368">Secondly, we say that, in this case, Polites had a chance to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.606" offset="7449788">He had a chance to present his case to the Court of Appeals and to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.224" offset="7472253">He voluntarily relinquished his right of appeal without any suggestion of broader imposition or impropriety and we feel that he is bound by that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.174" offset="7512064">And, third, we say that, because he voluntarily entered into this stipulation, agreeing to dismiss the appeal with prejudice is bound by the terms of that stipulation, unless something unconscionable appears and we find nothing in this record which even suggests inequity</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="1891.851" offset="7670784">It is -- it may not be very great but there's some difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.089" offset="7683741">But, in any event, we feel that, under each of these theories, petitioner is far close from relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.812" offset="7714670">Now, the motion to reopen was denied by Judge Picard and then appeal followed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which, in the very terse order, unanimously affirmed Judge Picard's order for the reasons that he has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.394" offset="7776946">Now, as I've said the motion to reopen was based on -- it was made in 1958 incidentally and was based on the decisions of this Court in 1958 in the Nowak and Maisenberg cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.704" offset="7826160">We believe those decisions and we shall show later that those decisions are inevitable, but I think it's more important to confront, first, at the outset the propriety of the relief which is sought by the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.009" offset="7895437">We respectfully submit that there is no warrant in Rule 60 (b), or elsewhere, for this effort to reopen a five-year-old judgment made by one who voluntarily elected to dismiss his appeal without any showing of fraud, risk, impropriety, improper activities of government officials, or any other reason for disturbing the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.619" offset="8009853">In fact, in our view, this belated plea lies in the face of the need for an orderly administration of justice and is directly opposed to at least two decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.390" offset="8064920">Now, we agree that naturalization is a precious privilege and that citizenship rights must receive full protection, but it also must be remembered that the right to citizenships through naturalization is granted and may be revoked through a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.005" offset="8155408">The applicant for naturalization is given his day in court when he seeks citizenship and he is also given his day in court when the government moves to revoke that citizenship grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.669" offset="8202010">Polites had his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.346" offset="8212773">He had a full day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.036" offset="8223535">And when the decision again -- went against him, he decided not to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.164" offset="8247986">We believe that under such circumstances, Polites like every other litigant is bound by the judgment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.792" offset="8290513">Now, Rule 60 (b) obviously was not intended as a substitute for an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.806" offset="8314546">In my view, there is no sound basis for supporting the view that this rule grants the right to a defeated party sometime in the future to seek a reopening of the judgment merely because subsequent adjudications persuaded that he now might have a better chance particularly where he voluntarily relinquished the right to test that theory in the original proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.255" offset="8428440">There are many authorities which oppose the position urged by the petitioner here and of course the most telling and convincing authority, in my view is that the decision of this Court in the Ackermann case 340 US I think the Ackermann case is exactly like this but I can't see any possible basis for distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.331" offset="8512658">The Ackermanns -- like this petitioner lost a denaturalization suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.680" offset="8538049">They -- thereafter considered the possibility of appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.109" offset="8567829">They decided not to appeal and voluntarily abandoned the right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.223" offset="8596250">In making this determination they were influenced by the fact that the appeal would be expensive, that it would've resulted in their having to sell their home, and also by the advice of an official of the Immigration of Naturalization Service who told them that in his opinion the appeal would be futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.411" offset="8680991">They relied on his advice and did not take the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.390" offset="8696978">Now, a co-defendant in the Ackermann case, a fellow named Keilbar, did take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.495" offset="8725400">Keilbar was the brother of Mrs. Ackermann.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.868" offset="8742849">He wanted to defend his citizenship rights and, therefore, he took an appeal to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.975" offset="8767300">While that appeal was pending, this Court decided the Baumgardner case which was inconsistent with the theory on which the judgment of denaturalization in the Ackermann case rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.463" offset="8821217">As a result of the decision of this Court in the Ackermann case, Keilbar obtained a reversal of the denaturalization judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.238" offset="8860296">Four years after the original denaturalization judgment in the Ackermann case, the Ackermanns made a motion to reopen the judgment under Rule 60 (b) claiming that, because of the intervening decisions in the Keilbar case and in the Baumgardner case, it was no longer equitable to enforce this denaturalization decree against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.568" offset="8965622">Yet, this Court determined that, under such circumstances, Rule 60 (b) did not afford a basis for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.576" offset="9013687">Now, at page 20 in our brief, we have an excerpt from the opinion of this Court in Ackermann, and it seems to me that the language used by the Court in that case is directly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.408" offset="9057050">I should like to refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.547" offset="9065514">The Court said, “Petitioner made a considered choice not to appeal, apparently, because he did not feel that the appeal would be worth -- would prove to be worth what he thought was a required sacrifice of his home."</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.531" offset="9129462">His choice was a risk, both calculated and deliberate and such as follows in free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.229" offset="9160286">Petitioner cannot be relieved of such a choice because hindsight seems to indicate to him that his decision not to appeal was probably wrong, considering the outcome of the Keilbar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.977" offset="9211277">There must be an end to litigation someday and free, calculated, and deliberate choices are not to be relieved from.</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.176" offset="9460067">Well, Your Honor discretion, I think is a treacherous word here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.621" offset="9469889">I think, in the construction of the rule, the construction by this Court in the Ackermann case, the Keilbar case, the rule of courts relief in a situation of this type of an old judgment, only when there are exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.329" offset="9544704">Now, if the exceptional circumstances support the framework of the discretion, then I agree with you Your Honor that it's discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.929" offset="9571140">But, the rule is that there can be no reopening unless there are exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.528" offset="9597471">And in this case, there are no exceptional circumstances of the type which are contemplated in Klapprott and Ackermann.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.270" offset="9628400">Now, three members of the court dissented in that, but their dissent rested solely on their belief that the right to appeal that -- that the petitioner in that case had been redirected from appealing by the improper action of government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.507" offset="9709380">This, they felt was an exceptional circumstance which justifies relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.787" offset="9730487">Now, in Ackermann, this Court distinguished its prior holding a year earlier in the Klapprott case which Mr. Clark had just adverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.466" offset="9773223">Klapprott also was a denaturalization suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.079" offset="9791718">Klapprott had defaulted in answering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.943" offset="9807182">He had not interposed an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.484" offset="9813347">There had been no trial of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.656" offset="9825991">Judgment by default had been entered against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.050" offset="9843545">Then, four years later he made a motion under Rule 60 (b) to reopen the judgment claiming that he had been prevented from defending by illness, lack of funds by interference of FBI agents, by imprisonment, and by similar circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.888" offset="9942915">Now, the opinions in the Klapprott case were concerned chiefly with the propriety of a default judgment, but they did make some significant observations in regard to the propriety of Rule 60 (b) relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.758" offset="10006444">Originally the courts directed that the default be vacated -- the judgment be vacated and that the case be sent back for a completely new trial of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.196" offset="10056182">However, on reconsideration the court modified its order and merely sent the case back for a hearing to determine whether the default had been deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.333" offset="10104665">A hearing was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.621" offset="10113860">The District Court concluded that the -- that the default had been deliberate and refused to reopen the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.566" offset="10145625">That determination was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and then this Court denied certiorari thus, appears that Klapprott is opposed to the position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.614" offset="10201840">For there, the Court refused to reopen a default in answering where there had been a determination that the default was deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.446" offset="10257115">I think the proper formulation, the proper approach to these cases, was that of Mr. Justice Black in his opinion in the Klapprott case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.638" offset="10305912">In that case, Mr. Justice Black said that a party could be relieved from a default in answering that case or for appealing, as in this case, only if there were a special situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.689" offset="10366098">This was the language of Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.399" offset="10376965">“An extraordinary situation” I believe was the language which, in effect, prevented him from appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.683" offset="10406118">This formulation was adopted by the court in the Ackermann case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.687" offset="10426075">And there, the prevailing opinion said the party can be relieved from his default in appearing -- in appealing, as in that case, only upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.858" offset="10486784">This was the language of the Ackermann case which prevented him from exercising his right to defend or exercising his right to appeal, as in Ackermann.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.590" offset="10541746">Now, it seems to me that there obviously are no special or extraordinary circumstances such as those contemplated by the Ackermann and the Klapprott cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.253" offset="10596394">In the first place, Just -- Mr. Justice Black, in his opinion in the Klapprott case, emphasized that there had been no trial of the issue here, and he felt that the defendant there, Mr. Klapprott, should be given an opportunity to have a trial of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.744" offset="10674343">Here, there was a full trial of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.940" offset="10691166">Secondly, there was -- there is no allegation that the petitioner was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel, as we suggested in the Klapprott case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.958" offset="10743202">Petitioner was represented throughout these litigations by able and experienced counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.147" offset="10771937">These were the same counsels who represented Sweet, Chomiak, and Charnowola in the contemporary cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.773" offset="10802448">These were the same attorneys who represented Nowak and Maisenberg in their efforts -- their successful efforts to reverse a denaturalization judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.354" offset="10844766">Now, there aren't any extraordinary circumstances here such as illness, imprisonment, improper activities of government officers or any of these special considerations which were involved in Klapprott or were alleged in Klapprott and to some extent were alleged in Ackermann.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.890" offset="10934941">Indeed, it seems to me that petitioner's situation is hardly as advantageous as that of Ackermann to whom this Court denied Rule 60 (b) relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3583.936" offset="14439111">Nowak and Maisenberg addressed -- insofar as the finding of illegality is concerned, addressed only the statutory requirement that a petitioner for naturalization must demonstrate that he is attached to the principles of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.298" offset="14520613">Now, the Court, in those cases, found that, although there was substantial and convincing evidence that Nowak and Maisenberg had been members of the Communist Party, although the -- there was a finding, apparently substantiated in the Court's view, that the Communist Party advocated the violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.329" offset="14640671">The lack of attachment which was the basis of the charge of illegal procurement could not be established for the purposes of a denaturalization suite, unless it were shown that the naturalized person himself advocated or was aware of the advocacy of those proscribed doctrines by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.231" offset="14748296">Now, Polites on the other hand was naturalized in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.091" offset="14771702">At that time, the Nationality Act of 1940 had become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.343" offset="14796779">The Nationality Act of 1940 continued to former statute's requirement of attachment to the principles of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.554" offset="14837635">However, the Nationality Act added something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.040" offset="14859577">It added a specific and detailed prohibition against the naturalization of aliens who themselves advocated or who were members of organizations that advocated the violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.090" offset="14927705">This was Section 305 of the Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.721" offset="14946304">Now, in the denaturalization suite before Judge Picard in 1953, the Government contended that Polites had been fraudulently and illegally naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.147" offset="15007953">The Court found that both charges were sustained and based its judgment of denaturalization on both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.018" offset="15039404">However, we believe that, insofar as the charge of fraud is concerned or was concerned at that time, this has become doubtful because of this -- the Court's later decisions in Nowak and Maisenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.018" offset="15103457">Now, we think the resemblance is so great that we do not trust the charge of court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.299" offset="15124564">However, the denaturalization decree also rested on a finding that the naturalization had been illegally procured and that was described in Judge Picard's opinion as the primary charge on which he rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.383" offset="15192900">Now, his finding of illegal procurement was based on this sequence of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.533" offset="15225501">First, that Polites had been a member of the Communist Party, which is not disputed, during the period of 1931 to 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.617" offset="15265834">This was within the 10-year-period preceding the naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.209" offset="15284224">The Court also found that the Communist Party advocated the violent overthrow of the Government and that, too, was not disputed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.999" offset="15319333">That finding is not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.328" offset="15328632">And, then, on the basis of these two prior findings, the Court found that, as a member of an organiz -- organization advocating the violent overthrow of the Government, Polites was disqualified from naturalization under the explicit and direct terms of Section 305 of the Nationality Act of 1940.</text>

            <text syncTime="3931.998" offset="15831333">I agree with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.492" offset="15833318">I think they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.510" offset="15841364">Now, Section 60 -- 305 had not yet been enacted at the time Nowak and Maisenberg were naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.717" offset="15878248">Of course, that Section was not before the Court in Nowak and Maisenberg and is not something which the court can be regarded as having decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.030" offset="15923493">Actually, the controlling precedent at that time were the decisions of the Court of Appeals in the Sweet, Chomiak, and Charnowola cases represented by the same council in which the court -- the three courts in those cases and the District Court had considered directly the applicability of Section 305 in which the Court of Appeals considered the applicability of 305 and in which this Court had denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.759" offset="16050448">Now, we believe that, in attempting to justify this application under Rule 60 (b), on the basis of subsequent decisions of this Court in Nowak and Maisenberg, petitioner is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.588" offset="16121710">We think what he actually is presenting here is an entirely new question, not considered at all in Nowak and Maisenberg and never before considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.374" offset="16172910">And, that question is whether Section 305, in prescribing for the denial of naturalization to members of “subversive organizations” is the certain short-hand term of use, required that the membership be with knowledge of the organization's proscribed dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.752" offset="16266428">Now, we think that this is an issue which he could have raised in the original proceeding and actually did raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.432" offset="16297148">It's been fully argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.365" offset="16308851">This was an issue that he could have raised in the appeal which he chose not to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.649" offset="16333928">And in our view, there isn't any basis in Rule 60 (b) or in any other valid consideration which would support his present effort to renew the controversy which he abandoned five years before his present motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.200" offset="16400175">Now, I should like to devote a few moment to the ultimate merits, if I may use that term, and that is whether, ultimately, he was properly denaturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.891" offset="16458898">And this, of course -- this question is reached only if we are wrong on proposition (a) that this relief is inappropriate, only if we are wrong, I believe, on propositions (b) that Nowak and Maisenberg, in our view, are inapplicable and, that is, attempt to reopen the proceedings relying on those decisions is supported by Nowak and Maisenberg, but if we are wrong on those two assumptions, then we may perhaps get to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.113" offset="16603826">Now, the merits of the case are, and this was developed by the testimony, that petitioner, at the time he applied for naturalization, by his own admission, was a member or had been a member between 1931 and 1938 of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.041" offset="16699538">During that time, he had been an active functionary of the party, serving as Secretary of the Greek Fraction, as a member of the bureau, and in other important capacities that, in 1938, when he left the party, he left it only because the party had adopted a national policy that aliens should get out, and had communicated that policy to him and he obeyed the orders of his superiors in the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.720" offset="16818239">And, he testified that, at the time of his naturalization in 1942, he still believed in the aims and objectives of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.684" offset="16862124">Now, the record demonstrates, in my view, that this membership, I think it's pretty well set forth in the record, was meaningful within the contemplation of this Court's decisions in the Rowoldt, Galvan, and Niukkanen cases for the purposes of the deportation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.494" offset="16953344">It is equally meaningful, I think, for the purposes of Section 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.785" offset="16974555">This was an active membership in the ranks of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.018" offset="16995453">Now, at the trial, the Government produced evidence through witnesses and documents that the Communist Party advocated the violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.368" offset="17052818">The court found that it was such an organization and that finding is not disputed here, as I understand petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.099" offset="17091793">The urgent wish of Congress to bar naturalization to alien communist is underscored in the legislative history of Section 305, which is described in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.759" offset="17142366">The legislative deliberations -- throughout the legislative deliberations, responses of this measure stated very definitely that they were aiming this statute at alien communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.616" offset="17197850">Now, the language of the statute itself and other materials in its background, I think, indicate very decisively that petitioner's argument, which he has not stated orally yet but which is addressed in his brief, that Section 305 was aimed only at members with personal knowledge of the organization's proscribed aims or mem -- or persons who themselves advocated those prescribed -- proscribed documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.204" offset="17344240">Now, I think a number of considerations, which I'll try to summarize briefly, tell us that Congress certainly did not mean to add such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.156" offset="17391992">In the first place, there is not even the suggestion of such a requirement in the language of Section 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.031" offset="17431489">In the second place, the legislative history demonstrates that, at one time, a proposal to include, to add such a requirement of personal knowledge or advocacy was proposed to Congress and that Congress did not adopt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.916" offset="17511006">And third, Your Honors will notice from reading Section 305 that it covers two types of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.563" offset="17545592">First, those who themselves advocate violent overthrow and, second, those who are members of organizations which advocate violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.096" offset="17599718">Now, the Senate report on this measure emphasizes that Congress intended to reach both types of cases, both those who themselves advocated violent overthrow and those who were members of organizations which advocated violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.469" offset="17685295">Finally, I think it is obvious that if Congress intended that the membership clause would require personal knowledge, then the second portion of the statute was utterly meaningless because, in the first statute, it had already dealt with persons who themselves believed in or advocated the violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.695" offset="17774111">Now finally, Your Honors will observe that the pertinent language of the controlling language, the language which we point here, of Section 305 are taken from and, no doubt were taken deliberately, from a resemble and no doubt were taken from the similar language of the Alien Registration Act, deportation provisions of the Alien Registration Act, which had been enacted by Congress only four months earlier and, which this Court has said in the Galvan case, did not contemplate personal knowledge of the party's violent aims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.408" offset="17961044">Now, we believe it is highly in Congress to suppose that, in Section 305, Congress intended to authorize denaturalization of aliens whose deportation it had commanded in the Alien Registration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.109" offset="18043800">It seems to us that, under the explicit terms and the manifest purpose of Section 305, the petitioner who was admittedly a member of the Communist Party, an organization bound by the Court and not disputed hereto, bound to have advocated the violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.705" offset="18130213">With those findings, petitioner was illegally naturalized within the contemplation of Section 305 which made him ineligible to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.491" offset="18185383">Now, from this conclusion, if we are correct in this conclusion, we think it follows that his naturalization is subject to revocation, under Section 338 of the Nationality Act of 1940, as a naturalization which was illegally procured.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.700" offset="18270124">Now that conclusion I think is supported by a number of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.050" offset="18299591">In the Ginsberg case, decided by this Court in 1917 the Court upheld a denaturalization decree based on illegal procurement when the individual had been naturalized in the Court's chambers rather than in open court as the statute require.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.113" offset="18395826">In the Ness and Maney cases which followed, this Court upheld denaturalization decrees but where there had not been attached to the petition for naturalization a certificate of lawful arrival, which the statute commanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.582" offset="18485687">Now, in each of those decisions, the ruling of this Court was unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.372" offset="18508884">Although, later, the latter two of these decisions, the opinions were delivered by Justices Brandeis and Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.615" offset="18545873">We hardly think that Congress was more concerned with these technical procedural requirements than with its vital interest in the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.266" offset="18580459">And, with it, very definitely expressed desire to bar alien communists during the time of national crisis when the Nationality Act of 1940 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.812" offset="18646601">Indeed, we think that, because of its paramount and exclusive authority over naturalization, it was well within the power of Congress to prescribe for the revocation of citizenship which had been illegally procured.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.092" offset="18703757">I think this is highlighted by the observations of this Court in the Ginsberg case, which we have a brief quotation from at page 43 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.804" offset="18750568">There the Court says, “No alien has the slightest right to naturalization unless all statutory requirements are complied with, and every certificate of naturalization of citizenship must be treated as granted upon condition that the Government may challenge it as provided in Section 15 and demand its cancellation, unless issued in accordance with such requirements, if procured when prescribed qualifications have no existence in fact, it is illegally procured and subject to cancellation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.607" offset="18905840">Now, we find nothing in the Schneiderman or the Nowak decisions which is inconsistent with the application of the Doctrine of Illegal Procurement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.532" offset="18953488">In Schneiderman, the Court was addressing merely the requirement of attachment to the principles of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.297" offset="18984521">The Court assumed that illegal procurement would be a valid basis for denaturalization, but found the proof inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.685" offset="19022137">In Nowak, the Court proceeded on like assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.223" offset="19044289">Now, here, we have breach of a direct requirement of a statute, in Section 305, which precluded denaturalization of an alien who was a member of an organization devoted to the violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.118" offset="19103848">We think that this is precisely the type of jurisdictional defect that this Court had in mind in its decisions in the Ginsberg, the Ness, and the Maney cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.912" offset="19147003">Moreover, we think it is precisely the type of jurisdictional requirement that was in the mind of Mr. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in the Schneiderman case, which we referred to at page 47 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.421" offset="19205099">Now, I think these observations are very much in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.606" offset="19221817">Mr. Justice Douglas said, “If an anarchist is naturalized, the United States may bring an action under Section 15 to set aside the certificate on the ground of illegality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.237" offset="19272286">Since Congress, by Section 7 of the Act, forbids denaturalization of anarchist, the alien anarchist who obtains the certificate has procured it illegally whatever the naturalization court may find.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.039" offset="19327561">The same would be true of Communists if Congress declared they should be ineligible to citizenship -- for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.355" offset="19360789">Then, proof that one was not a Communist and did not adhere to that party or its belief would become, like other expressed conditions of the Act, a so-called jurisdictional fact upon which they grant this revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.873" offset="19418885">We hold with Mr. Justice Douglas that where there is omission to comply with a jurisdictional requirement, the requirement specifically required by Congress, prescribed by Congress, there is an invalid naturalization within the contemplation of Section 338 of the Nationality Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.647" offset="19510000">Here, we have such a specific jurisdictional requirement in Section 305 which declared, “No alien shall hereafter be naturalized who belongs to the one of the organizations described in the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.602" offset="19569768">We think that, since there has been a violation of such a jurisdictional requirement, denaturalization was illegally procured and was, therefore, subject to revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.662" offset="19622013">In our view, Judge Picard was clearly right in 1953 when he found that this naturalization in 1942 had been illegally procured, and when he cancelled Polites' citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.367" offset="19688887">We believe, therefore, that the attack on the ultimate merits must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.975" offset="19707277">In our view, the judgments reop -- refusing to reopen the 1953 judgment is clearly correct, and we urge that it would be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. George W. Crockett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4916.654" offset="19769971">Mr. Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.300" offset="19788570">I should like to deal very briefly with one or two points advanced by counsel, which I think are readily answerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.126" offset="19823888">He places, I believe, undue emphasis upon the fact that the appeal in this case was dismissed with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.419" offset="19857011">I do not think any significance attaches to the words with prejudice because the -- the appeal was dismissed approximately one year after it was taken and it would necessarily be with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.376" offset="19904867">He suggests further that this is an attempt by the petitioner to gain a retrial of his denaturalization proceeding under circumstances where he thinks the outcome will be more favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.946" offset="19971114">I deny that because the petitioner is not asking for a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.955" offset="19987205">He does not regard this as a matter of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.820" offset="19998699">I thought I made it clear at the outset that we would suggest to the District Court that, in the light of Maisenberg and Nowak, a reconsideration of the facts in petitioner's case might warrant that Court in concluding that petitioner's case was decided erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.018" offset="20071424">The Court does not necessarily have to conclude that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.951" offset="20083127">The Court might very well say, “Well, in the light of those decisions, I am still not persuaded that the Government has proved the case by clear and convincing evidence and, yet, I do not feel sufficiently doubtful to cancel denaturalization, but I do feel sufficiently doubtful to listen to these other considerations that he is mentioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.724" offset="20174242">The primary one being, should this judgment be allowed to serve as a foundation, as a springboard for the Government to now uproot this man and send him back to another country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.059" offset="20223561">Now, impinging on such a consideration would be such other factors as the fact that the petitioner has been a law-abiding citizen in this country ever since he came here at the age of 16 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.411" offset="20269014">He is 60 years of age now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.603" offset="20277791">He needs a little help and I think the immigration service is aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.366" offset="20292838">I pointed out in our petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.600" offset="20305795">In addition to that, he has no family in Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.059" offset="20315617">His entire family is here, his American-born wife, his two children, and his two grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.108" offset="20343829">He is not employed now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.946" offset="20351143">Now, all of those are considerations that tend to show what, I agree Ackermann and Klapprott point out, must be an extraordinary situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.847" offset="20390745">But, there is another extraordinary situation here that was not present in Ackermann, for example, and that stems from new legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.335" offset="20424704">In Ackermann, the petitioner was not threatened with denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.605" offset="20445811">There was no statute that provided that, for conduct which he had done in the past, he could now be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.855" offset="20474755">Meanwhile, in this case, there is such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.850" offset="20486771">Congress has provided that if, at any time, you were a member of the Communist Party and you are an alien, you can be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.308" offset="20520626">So, we have a combination of circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.203" offset="20532224">Because of his denaturalization, he is an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.318" offset="20544658">Because of an act that he is -- that he admittedly did back in the early 1930s, he admitted membership in the Communist Party, he can now be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.945" offset="20583111">But, that can only follow so long as the judgment of denaturalization is allowed to have prospective application, so long as the judgment of denaturalization can serve as a basis for regarding him as an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.827" offset="20634728">Now, those are factors, which I again submit, are more -- I would not say more capably, but I would say a more easily assessed on the District Court level than they are on the level of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.767" offset="20690422">Now, the Chief Justice asked counsel whether or not, in the Ackermann case, the court there -- the District Court reached and decided the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.096" offset="20735770">And, as I understood counsel's answer, he suggested that there was not a decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.867" offset="20758862">However, I believe an examination of that case will indicate the following, The District Court denied the motion in an order which stated, “There is no merit to said motion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.143" offset="20823960">And then, the court went on to point out why it felt that there was no merit to the application for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.311" offset="20848619">The court clearly indicated, “If there were merit, I have power in the sense of having jurisdiction to grant that relief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.946" offset="20895117">Now, counsel did not set forth, in answer to several questions from the bench, what are the normally recognized standards for granting relief under Section 60 (b) -- 60 (b) (5) and (6)?</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.459" offset="20965230">And, is it an unfailing rule that merely because one fails to appeal, that, in itself, precludes him from getting a relief under Rule 60 (b) (5) or (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.911" offset="21010996">Well, there are several standards for playing Rule 60 (b) (5) or (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.031" offset="21023535">Normally, the Court will not grant relief on either of those sections if intervening rights of third parties have become vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.594" offset="21061778">Let's take one case decided by the government in its brief, Collins against Wichita.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.500" offset="21081422">That was a condemnation proceeding and, incidentally, there, an appeal was taken and this Court denied certiorari, and then an application was made for relief based upon a later decision of this Court which held that the statute providing for notice in the condemnation proceeding was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.582" offset="21153729">The court there denied relief not because an appeal was not taken because an appeal was taken.But there had been intervening rights of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.281" offset="21188524">The city had condemned the property and put in a very expensive water main.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.330" offset="21204720">The court said, “Where real estate rights like that are concerned, we will not disturb it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.555" offset="21221543">And, the same thing is true in these other so-called condemnation cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="5315.574" offset="21365635">The Government was the one that instituted the denaturalization proceeding against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.614" offset="21385801">The Government was the one who trust the District Court to make a judgment, which we contend was an erroneous judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.214" offset="21412237">I don't go into a discussion of why the judgment is erroneous, but let's assume that the judgment was erroneous and that the District Court decides that it was erroneous.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="5335.108" offset="21443793">Why should I make any quick assumption?</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.261" offset="21456436">Since you had a -- since he had a very able knowledge of a counsel who told him that, under the law, it was not erroneous.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_w_crockett_jr" startTime="5348.292" stopTime="5861.220">
            <label>Mr. George W. Crockett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5348.292" offset="21496560">I suppose I turn then Your Honor to the discussion of whether or not the judgment itself is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.224" offset="21520280">I don't feel that it is necessary to get to that point, but since the counsel has spent quite a bit of time talking about it, I would like to do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.228" offset="21548283">He begins by conceding that the judgment is erroneous under Nowak and Maisenberg insofar as it found that my client was had procured his naturalization by fraud or, be it, the Government's brief waits until I think it is the very last footnote in which that concession is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.809" offset="21618604">So, the idea of fraud is completely out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.649" offset="21633964">We go then to the other ground for denaturalization, which was illegal procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.522" offset="21657475">Now, there, the government is on very tenuous ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.234" offset="21672312">First, they quote from Mr. Justice Douglas, but I think they do a disservice to Mr. Justice Douglas in their quotation because at that time, the statute specifically mentioned anarchist and precluded the naturalization of anarchist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.107" offset="21731767">The statute did not pro -- specifically mentioned communist.Mr. Justice Douglas was merely saying “if Congress had said no communist shall be granted citizenship, then, obviously, proof that a man was a communist was all that was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.187" offset="21792162">That is not what the statute says at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.937" offset="21803133">It was not until 1952 that statute was amended to make any such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.186" offset="21824136">So what we have here is a case in which the Court concludes that there is sufficient evidence to show that the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party and that the Communist Party, within the 10-year-period taught and advocated the violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.394" offset="21900936">The Court did not go on to find, and specifically disclaim any intention to find, that this petitioner had knowledge of any such illegal advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.827" offset="21942732">The Government argues that we, on this occasion, do -- that we concede that the Communist Party was an organization that taught and advocated according to this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.350" offset="21980766">We make no such concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.263" offset="21988394">As a matter of fact, in our brief, we point out repeatedly that we are incorporating by a reference, all of the pertinent arguments that we made in the Nowak case and, in addition, on page 21, I think, this -- of our brief where we discussed the insufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.051" offset="22047535">We point out here that the evidence did not show, in our view of the evidence, illegal teaching and advocacy and certainly did not show knowledge on the part teaching and advocacy and certainly, it did not show knowledge on the part of this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.076" offset="22091630">Now, why do I say that the evidence did not show illegal teaching and advocacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.817" offset="22110647">First, because you have here no more than the evidence that you had in the Nowak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5509.168" offset="22140008">And, there, the Court was unable to conclude that the proofs were sufficient to show that the party taught and advocated overthrow the government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.786" offset="22186506">The court said assuming that without deciding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.331" offset="22200717">But, in addition to that, the Court also called attention to its previous decision in Yates versus United States where it clearly pointed out that the teaching and the advocacy must be of a character that incites to action and that in the absence of any such showing of incitement, you could not say this was the kind of teaching and advocacy contemplated by Congress in the use of those words which have come to be words of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.970" offset="22315238">Obviously, when you read the quotations that are set forth in our brief and the references that are made in the Government's brief, I think you come to the conclusion that, here, again, the government has failed to show by clear convincing unequivocal evidence that the Communist Party in 1930 when the petitioner admittedly was a member of it, engaged in teaching in advocacy of the violent overthrow of the government in words of incitement to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.571" offset="22425684">There is no such indication here in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.650" offset="22438013">Now, this whole idea of what constitutes illegal procurement is one that seems to have confused the District Courts for a long, long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.284" offset="22488482">In the Schumer case in the Eastern District of Michigan, I believe you will find the one and only decision with exception of the subsequent decision in Polites' case where a District Court has held that a mere showing of membership in the Communist Party and that the Communist Party was an organization that taught and advocated force and violence without any indication of any knowledge on the part of the petitioner of such teaching and advocacy constituted illegal procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.863" offset="22622856">As a result of those two decisions, I might say, both of those two decisions were considered by Judge Goodman of the Northern District of California who, I might say parenthetically, is regarded in many courts as being an authority on immigration law, has having been erroneously decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.133" offset="22703940">He interprets illegal procurement to mean any instance where the record on the denaturalization proceeding fails to show that all of the requirements of the statute were met before there was a grant of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.603" offset="22781785">And so, he says “Ginsberg?</text>
            <text syncTime="5671.529" offset="22789517">That's correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.581" offset="22793697">The record there clearly showed that he was granted citizenship without the requirement of a hearing in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.815" offset="22822640">He goes on to consider the other cases dealing with residence and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5683.913" offset="22839045">That interpretation makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.108" offset="22847822">Applying that to Polites' case where is there anywhere in the record of his naturalization any proof that the Communist Party -- any proof, one, that he was a member of the Communist Party, and two, that the Communist Party at that time taught and advocated the violent overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.857" offset="22918771">The Court made no such finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.012" offset="22927444">On the record of his naturalization, every requirement made by Congress in the statute was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.872" offset="22954820">Under those con -- circumstances it cannot I contend be logically argued that his citizenship was illegally procured.</text>
            <text syncTime="5727.248" offset="23012394">Now, I desire to take up just one final point and that brings me back to the question of whether or not the District Court here was justified in concluding that merely because of the failure to appeal, there was no power in the District Court to grant the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.839" offset="23094732">And in that connection, I want to call attention to the case cited in the Government's brief the Elgin case on page 29 and point out that in that case an appeal was actually taken and relief was denied but when later a petition was made setting four circumstances that showed an extraordinary situation within the -- within the opinion of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.965" offset="23203192">The court did not say merely because you took an appeal and the issue has already been resolved, we will not grant you relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.640" offset="23229942">Instead, the District Court granted the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.150" offset="23239973">The Circuit Court said, “We see no basis for disturbing the discretion that was exercised by the District Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.197" offset="23268185">So, we submit -- may it please the Court that in this case the appropriate remedy would be to send this case back to the District Court just as was done in Klapprott with directions take testimony and determine whether or not this is an exceptional situation within the prior holdings of this Court, and if you find or if you do not find that this is an exceptional situation then exercise your discretion in determining whether or not relief should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.319" offset="23388662">Thank you.</text>
