            <text syncTime="23.282" offset="196524">I think that this Court has very clear conception of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.868" offset="226826">There are two I think I might mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.798" offset="242604">It is clear that the petitioner was a passenger in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.457" offset="273220">His traveling in interstate commerce would've been in Richmond (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="49.066" offset="299656">He left the bus and came into a private owned and operated restaurant located in the terminal building in Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.772" offset="354408">That privately owned restaurant operated separate facilities for members of each race.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.293" offset="384502">The testimony is specifically clear that the restaurant is in no way affiliated with or controlled by the bus company.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.371" offset="428805">It operates under a lease, just as a lease of any other business establishments at such of its term at least it's on the record but the policies of the restaurant with those other restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.812" offset="486588">Petitioner came into the section which is reserved for white patrons and was informed that he could not be served there, and that he would have to go into the other portion of the restaurant which is reserved for Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.939" offset="539146">He refused to leave the premises and when he refused to do so, he was directly arrested for trespass after warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.875" offset="594840">The Virginia statue is quoted at page 4 of the brief on behalf of the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.303" offset="640606">And it simply provides that it is not a segregation statute at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.572" offset="661608">It is a statute which provides that if any person shall without any authority law go upon or remain upon the grounds of premises of another, after having been forbidden to do so by the owner or the person in control, then he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.607" offset="737782">That statute has been on the statute books of Virginia since 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.492" offset="797341">There have been one or two amendments since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.022" offset="819493">The provision for sign was included after the warning by signs and anyone who is familiar with the legislative history of that statute as to where the fact of that provision was put in there to deal with these unattended parking lots where automobiles were driven in a private property where there was no attendants so that happen to be the reason why that was inserted in.</text>
