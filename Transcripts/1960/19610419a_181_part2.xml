            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Commenting upon the self-revealing opinion of Judge Campbell, our Senior District Judge in the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.137" offset="167894">Judge Campbell's opinion which is quite long finds that there was no physical coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.567" offset="197674">Finds that there was psychological coercion, find -- holds that according to what he deems to have been the criteria of due process in this area in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.998" offset="271339">The confession must fully received, says, that he recognizes that the concept of due process has been expanded in this area and others since 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.075" offset="343646">Matt holds that this case should be judged by the constitutional peanuts and doctrines of 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.352" offset="392756">He says this and I asked the Chief Justice's permission to read some six lines to inform the Court without either adopting or disclaiming the contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.020" offset="459421">He says, â€œCertainly a judge owes a duty to society to apply the law impartially but it seems monstrous when discharge of such a duty results and in endangering that same society.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.964" offset="515218">It cannot be denied that the rights of the individual must be protected but can we not achieve civilized standards or procedure without the necessity of turning dangers, criminals, loose upon society, says that it is his finding that believes that if petitioner is discharged, he will commit another crime that it will be on his Judge Campbell's conscience if that occurs and he holds, I think for the first time in the Annals of Federal Jurisprudence that due process does not require the discharge of a dangerous man even if his conviction was infected by what would deny due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.268" offset="784488">I am just explaining neither adopting nor disclaiming a rationale of the District Judge, I think he may admit to hold recurred of the text of the constitution which says that the writ of habeas corpus will not be suspended except when whether is it war or rebellion, or the perfect safe -- public safety may require and then he thinks that this is a case where in the public safety so requires and therefore suspends a writ that isn't what he says but that would be list of textual apologetic based on the letter with the constitution for what he does.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.331" offset="988662">Well, is that the judgement we review?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_wines" startTime="225.992" stopTime="506.964">
            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="225.992" offset="1007365">No, I think not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.978" offset="1015306">And we discussed that in the opening paragraph of our brief for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.394" offset="1040906">The -- Your Honor's rules of civil procedure provide that findings of a trier of the fact shall not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous adding the language for having do regard for the trier's ability to see and hear are the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.395" offset="1172982">That is in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.358" offset="1180818">Judge Campbell, did read more of the record than did the Supreme Court of Illinois, I have confirmed that and that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.477" offset="1217285">But he saw no more witnesses than -- did the judges of the Court of Appeals nor then Your Honors have seen nor we'll see in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.231" offset="1264306">And we do make the point briefly but we think it's clear that when no federal court has seen or heard any witnesses, the clearly erroneous rule has a -- an entirely different content and aspect from what it has when the time honored function of seeing and hearing witnesses has occurred in the judgment under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.546" offset="1389589">Before I conclude, I am very anxious to say that without assimilating the cases factually because there are differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.665" offset="1438072">We place a principle or reliance on Stein against New York and on Lisenba against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.747" offset="1470360">In the Lisenba case, Lisenba made a confession of guilt of murder under circumstances that all nine of the then members of this Court said denied due process all nine of them said.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.710" offset="1538173">After he had made that confession, however, and I'll admit after talking to a lawyer which did not occur in this case, so I'll admit that Lisenba was an older and mentally more alert and aware defendant in this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.884" offset="1610898">He was confronted by the dumbing confession of a codefendant implicating.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.405" offset="1649037">He then made a confession in which he adopted and reiterated the confession that this Court had held was obtained without due process and a majority of this Court held not without dissent to be sure what a majority of this Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.040" offset="1739525">That voluntarily, confession would sustain his -- his conviction even though he had previously made it involuntary when and in this case, the evidence shows that petitioner made two confessions, the second confession he made to a group of civilians who were neither prosecutors, policeman or public officers, they were composed of the foreman of prior Illinois Cook County, Grand Juries and a group of medical men.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.804" offset="1886542">To be sure, the medical men weren't there as doctors, they made no examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.392" offset="1908903">But what happened was this, he was called in.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.152" offset="1931995">We say that the jury could draw and this Court should not disturb the inference that he could then and would have if this confession had not been voluntary when asked, said, "Well, I know I didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.561" offset="1989569">They made me confess to this crime."</text>
            <text syncTime="475.477" offset="2005243">None of the doctors observed any of the psychological stigmata in his discussion that are supposed to vitiate the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.720" offset="2050278">We say that this case resented only a question of fact that there is adequate basis in the record to sustain the findings of a juries and courts that have held this confession to be voluntary and that therefore, this judgment should be reversed.</text>
