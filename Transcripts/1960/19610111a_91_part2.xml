            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="1.289" offset="108544">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.213" offset="116276">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.333" offset="124740">If Congress had intended to proscribe loans as well as gifts in the original act, it could've done so simply by adding the word "lend" and "loan" as it did 12 years later when after congressional investigations in McClellan Committee hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.204" offset="204152">It appeared that there were a number of loan transactions at which time Senator Kennedy set upon the record as it appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.880" offset="230902">"This isn't against the law but don't you think we ought to do something about this situation?"</text>
            <text syncTime="36.343" offset="248769">And the amendment resulted thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.866" offset="262875">But there is one aspect to this problem which -- about which we can be dogmatic, said this Court in the Bell case, it is that when Congress has the will, it can express it particularly in so simple a matter as an evidence that could do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.474" offset="321285">Indeed, there are two contemporaneous statutes within one year of this one in which Congress was not contempt with the word payment or gift or contribution but did provide lend and loan in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.144" offset="387950">And most significantly Your Honors, in those cases too, the language appeared, payment of money or other thing of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.187" offset="428074">And the Congress did not deem the words "or anything of value" to encompass a loan, and specifically provided the word lend and loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.088" offset="475721">The classic tenant of construction with respect to common words even in none criminal statutes and particularly, I stress in the penal statute which is malum prohibitum and requires fair warning to the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.992" offset="543326">Is that the verbs will be given the limitation of their ordinary market place use, even though linguists and scholars may define larger meanings for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.480" offset="593272">So the word “pay” in market place usage, means "to discharge an obligation," it doesn't mean "to initiate one" as you do when you make a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.760" offset="634441">There are many synonyms for the word pay on the dictionaries but no one will find lend as one of those synonyms.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.878" offset="662862">And similarly, the word “deliver”, in its market place usage which is required for fair warning to the average citizen malum prohibitum statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.970" offset="703300">The word “deliver” is never associated with loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.363" offset="712808">You don't deliver a loan, you make one, as this Court said in the Western Union Lend Group case were the word was ship or commodity, child labor statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.655" offset="753977">Ship did not apply to a telegram.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.458" offset="761187">You don't ship a telegram, you send it.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.319" offset="776652">The statute clearly fails to proscribe and wasn't ever intend to proscribe loans at the time that it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.589" offset="813746">And therefore, it is not proper we think for the Government to presume that this language maybe ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.843" offset="854706">As this Court said in the Bell case when Congress leaves to the judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity, even ambiguity wouldn't aid the Government in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.319" offset="912697">Nor, may the Government presume that in order to effectuate the beneficent purpose of the statute that it should be broadened to cover other categories which Congress in its wisdom might well have found consistent with its general purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.083" offset="983751">This Court has repeatedly rejected that invitation stating at one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.671" offset="1006007">It is Congress which defines the penal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.155" offset="1023979">It is Congress which defines the crime that ordains the punishment, not the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.837" offset="4590738">A statute which says that you may not ship indecent books, papers or writings is not held to apply to a letter because if Congress meant to warn the citizens that he may not send an indecent letter, it should've included the word lend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.317" offset="4648626">A statute which says, "Spirituous liquors or wines are forbidden," in interstate commerce under certain circumstances does not apply to log a beer and this Court even made the observation when they was -- the point made that there was scientific evidence of its alcoholic content.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.003" offset="4739427">Not to get scientific evidence about the degree of alcohol.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.553" offset="4781537">Now, these -- this type of decision, which applies peculiarly in malum prohibitum cases comes with greater impact in this case because it has been held in this case that the criminal intention, mens rea, need not be proved in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="1923.786" offset="7798471">Long before, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.142" offset="7807979">In other words, the sequence here is, the loan is made in 1954, repaid in 1955, McClellan Committee 1957, amendment, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.931" offset="7851133">And Your Honor, the Harvard Law Review, from an academic viewpoint analyzing this also and we quote, it says, "This adds a proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.656" offset="7886033">Loans are now prohibited."</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.040" offset="7895542">And I wish therefore to conclude with this observation, that the most that can be said for the Government position, which is that this was merely clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.106" offset="7931800">Something that already existed in the statute is that if it is necessary to clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.537" offset="7953533">If there is even that much doubt taking it on that extreme posture, then under these prohibitum cases where criminal intention needn't be proved and a citizen should be given fair warning, that in itself is fatal to the kind of a statute which does not give a warning and tell a man that from henceforth, you may not make a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.408" offset="8025004">For under common law, it was not illegal to make even a gift, not only a loan and the citizen should have been told that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.720" offset="8058232">So that it seems to us there's only one other case pending since 1947 to this date involving a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.950" offset="8087176">This is not a matter which involves a large evasion of the purposes of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.659" offset="8105984">In 1959, this amendment was passed and henceforth every citizen knows there can be no transaction involving a loan bona fide or -- or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.314" offset="8144645">So that this is academic, it's a moot proposition involving this one case under circumstances where no warning was given to this citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.707" offset="8178186">It therefore appears to us that there's no need, even if there would be merit otherwise, in a procedure which would send this back for other procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.869" offset="8222804">If it matters in Your Honor's discretion, I should think it would exercise your discretion to close this matter for there is nothing more involved in the case and it was justly construed in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.207" offset="8268152">Thank you --</text>
