            <text syncTime="15.070" offset="163610">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.332" offset="172701">This case is here on certiorari, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to review its judgment in the civil action brought by the United States to recover statutory damages for the fraudulent purchases of government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.874" offset="238843">Respondent Hougham is a used car dealer, the other three respondents are veterans, who had been found fraudulently obtained veteran's priorities certificates and used them to purchase for Hougham some $79,500 worth of surplus trucks and trailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.656" offset="318046">The fraud consisted of misrepresentations and their applications for these certificates that the property was to be used by them in their own businesses whereas in fact they had no businesses in purchasing the property for Hougham.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.372" offset="380844">Those findings were affirmed on appeal and they are not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.851" offset="398817">The only question here is the measure of recovery to which the United States is entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.885" offset="426924">The statute, Section 26 (b) of the Surplus Properly Act of 1944, which is set forth in our main brief at pages 2 and 3, provides three alternative measures of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.343" offset="484707">The defrauder is required to pay either $2,000 for each fraudulent act plus double damages or if the United States shall so elect, a sum equal to twice the consideration agreed to be given to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.136" offset="555865">Or again, if United States shall so elect to restore the property itself and forfeit you on this page.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.224" offset="596302">Now, neither the last option nor actual damages under the first option are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.155" offset="620022">And the choice here is narrowed to recovery of either $2,000 for each act or double consideration damages under the second option.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.340" offset="672684">The Government's claim is that it is entitled to recover under the second option 26 (b) (2) that is twice the $79,500 paid for the property or a total of a $159,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.573" offset="733706">The District Court affirmed by the Court of Appeals held that we were entitled to recover only under the first option that is $2,000 for each act.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.657" offset="3837994">On -- getting to the grounds for the Court of Appeals' decision, which as we understand it is -- it's just that the District Court is not bound by our election.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.075" offset="3895672">I would like to say, first and which I think is a complete answer is that the District Court never made the finding for the Court of Appeals' reports to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.354" offset="3936737">The District Court's conclusions of law explicitly and exclusively are based upon the ground that the original election was irrevocable as a matter of law, not an exercise of discretion by the District Court to choose for itself among the remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.091" offset="4011760">It just held that we were bound by our first election.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.583" offset="4029733">But passing -- passing that difficulty, we think it's equally clear that the District Court does not have the discretion to choose among the remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.305" offset="4064632">The statute on that question is as ex -- as explicit as it is possible seems to us first statute to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.115" offset="4095875">It says that the defaulter shall pay $2,000 or, if the United States shall so elect, shall pay twice the consideration agree could be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.923" offset="4139029">Or, if the United States shall so elect, return the property and forfeit the amount of pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.622" offset="4169853">Now, if the Court of Appeals suggested that the reason for the words at the election of the Government was to make it clear that the remedies were not accumulated, but not -- we think obviously is not an explanation because the disjunctive or by itself makes them alternative instead of cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.829" offset="4254699">And the only possible function for the words, if United States shall so elect, is to make clear who it is and how the choice is to be made, namely is to be made by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.251" offset="4304332">Now, since the statutory expressly gives United States the right to recover whichever of the three alternatives it elects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.041" offset="4335574">We think it's clear that upon a timely and proper election, there's no function that the District Court other than the traditional one of determining whether the Government has proved its case and established the amount to which it is entitled under the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.556" offset="4405582">Now in particular, I would like to say that respondent's suggestion that -- and this maybe behind the Court of Appeals' decision that the Government's election should be disallowed unless the Government affirmatively proves actual damages proportionate to the recovery, which simply defeat the purpose statute which as this Court acknowledge in the Rex Trailer case and through 50 U.S. was to provide a -- a liquidated measure of recovery for damages which are in their very nature difficult or even impossible to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.909" offset="4558973">Now, I don't want to be understood of saying that there are no judicially and forcible limits on what the Government elects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.489" offset="4589380">We can acknowledge this -- the possibility at least of the case arising in which a literal application of one of the remedies would produce a -- a -- recovery so grossly disproportionate to any possible remedial purpose that it might by the constitutional limitations or possibly limitations implicit in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.221" offset="4668270">But, all that mean is that when that happens in any given case, the Court properly can and should disallow the recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.673" offset="4694079">It doesn't mean that the Court has general discretion in all cases to choose among the three alternatives, so long as the Government's choice does not produce an unconstitutionally excessive result or otherwise illegal result if we submit must be given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.757" offset="4770356">I would like also to answer the other arguments on which the respondent seeks to sustain the judgment, which were not adapted by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.258" offset="4816436">I've dealt already with the argument that we didn't raise the issue in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.901" offset="4839006">We did make our election in pretrial order and that was the controlling order under a new case and the Court ruled them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.455" offset="4877145">He makes also another argument which depends upon that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.013" offset="4891460">He argues that the election should not be allowed because the change of election should not be allowed, because of the prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.186" offset="4928136">The prejudice that he claims is that the case was tried on the -- under the first option of the $2,000 pack assessment theory and he says that he would therefore be prejudiced if he now apply a different measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.992" offset="4995323">But the fact is that he made the election before the trial and not after the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.555" offset="5757576">Well, the first of which is suggested by the Court of Appeals, so I don't think that is it's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.279" offset="5780459">The Court of Appeals suggests that it may not be applicable at all to executed transactions only to a transaction where there has been an agreement to purchase which has never been executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.834" offset="5842735">Now, there's nothing in the language of the Section to suggest that distinction and we do not understand why it would ever be more posit in one case that the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.796" offset="5894562">If anything, it's a less burdensome recovery in an executed transaction than in an unexecuted one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.429" offset="5929044">In the executed transaction, the defaulter does end up paying three times instead of twice the price for the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.076" offset="5959659">But, for the third payment, he got the goods and he's entitled to keep them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.438" offset="5977109">And therefore, he got the benefit of his bargain and pays his damages only the same amount that the -- that he would in an unexecuted transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.030" offset="6015457">And certainly, there's no reason to prefer the one who gets the fruit to this bargain over the one who discovered before he's able to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.253" offset="6044400">The respondent's argument here is slightly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.675" offset="6066030">He agrees that it applies generally to execute transactions, but contends that the transaction must, at one point, or a (Inaudible) in time have been executory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.418" offset="6117021">He distinguishes between a bid and award with a high max before payment and an over-the-counter sale with simultaneous payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.542" offset="6157563">Presumably on the ground that the statute refers to consideration agreed to be given and an over-counter -- over-the-counter sale, there's consideration given but none agreed to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.973" offset="6211271">Well, first the record does not support his characterization of these transactions, but more than that the -- the distinction we think is of no substance in over-the-counters -- even in over -- over-the-counter sale, the parties necessarily agreed on the price to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.879" offset="6282846">And there is an agreement which would in fact support a maximum contract if by miscounting the change or otherwise, it turned out to be not paid to full price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.477" offset="6333315">And finally, we think, there is no possible reason to distinguish the measure of recovery on the basis of whether or not there was a measurable (Inaudible) or time between the agreement and the payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.559" offset="6533622">They are all typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.011" offset="6539368">Against the defendant, Owen Dailey had asked for $138,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.351" offset="6560789">That figure is right there on the basis of $2,000, a purchase as alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.909" offset="6587016">In other words, $2,000 an act and the material part of what you inquired about says this, "Plus double the amount of damages which this Court may deem together with cost and interest in cost of this suit".</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.972" offset="6643231">The complaint in no respect, in any place alleges that the Government suffered any monetary damage of any kind or damage of any character except a so-called benefit that it might have been deprived of by having one otherwise not entitled to purchase of product at a fair price, in other words, the selection of the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.380" offset="6764857">It is our position, if the Court please, that this problem that the Government poses has never been properly presented to this Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals or to the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.281" offset="6840508">As counsel says, "It came into the case at a time not when the Government had indicated that -- the Court had indicated possibly that $2,000 per act was -- was improper because an election is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.745" offset="6926399">It came before the Court at a time when the Government was arguing $2,000 an act in response to a motion for summary judgment and the point was made that the allegation -- did -- the complaint would not support a prayer for damages for double consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.912" offset="7011035">Now, that is the status of the case and in the heat of that argument, the Government voluntarily withdrew its motion to file this First Amended Complaint never did present it or any other complaint in which any prayer for damages other than $2,000 per act was sought for by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.470" offset="7217298">It is inserted in that pretrial order out of thin air.</text>
