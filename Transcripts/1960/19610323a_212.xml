            <text syncTime="214.315" offset="960658">Now, we have approximately $6 million in mortgages outstanding against the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.611" offset="985840">They assessed the property at a figure which if we disregard equalization figures and so forth would -- would put these -- put the market value at approximately $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.185" offset="1052087">Now, the Government, in condemning this property, paid in as estimated compensation, $253,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.695" offset="1086151">Grant County sought to obtain actually more money than the total amount paid in by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.581" offset="1121677">The lower court, in this case -- the application was made by Grant County to impress their tax lien against this estimated compensation on the ground that the -- that a lien rested against the leasehold, therefore, the estimated compensation being substituted for the lien and became substituted for the estimated compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.220" offset="1236302">The lower court found and the Circuit Court of Appeals has concurred in the finding that the proceeding followed by Grant County in this matter was discriminatory against a contractor with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.529" offset="1313520">Now, this is the reason for that holding in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.052" offset="1335568">We have a statute that provides, this is R.C.W. 84.40.030, it's cited in my brief and it's in the appendix, "Taxable leasehold estate shall be valued at such price as they would bring at a fair voluntary sale for cash."</text>
            <text syncTime="326.366" offset="1408815">Now, you know of taxable leaseholds.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.072" offset="1415711">They're especially -- they're especially covered by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.500" offset="1433370">In a long line of cases in Washington known as the Metropolitan Building Company cases, the Washington Supreme Court has construed that statute with respect to all leaseholds held from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.428" offset="1501080">And in those cases, which involved state-owned land in the heart of Seattle under 50-year leases, it was sought by the public authorities to tax them upon the basis of the value of the improvements on the property rather than the value of the leasehold as someone would buy it and let someone would pay for it, and that -- those contentions were rejected four times by the Washington Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.387" offset="1640887">And I set out the cases in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.340" offset="1652694">And the Court held in that case that in Washington, in taxing a leasehold, the leasehold must be taxed on its -- on a reasonable market value what a willing seller -- what a willing -- what a willing seller could obtain from a willing buyer considering the burdens and benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.945" offset="1759169">And the Court said that a purchaser would take it (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="418.733" offset="1778291">And that if there was a large mortgage against the property that that mortgage would be taken into consideration, and the method of taxing all leaseholds in Washington, all other leaseholds in Washington, is well-established and that is what would a willing buyer to take -- pay to a willing seller, considering the encumbrances, the burdens and benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.428" offset="1885080">Now, when we got to this matter of the Wherry housing projects, it had considerable litigation over this and the first of these -- these three corporations to be organized were Moses Lake Homes, Inc. and Moses Lake Homes, Inc. obtained, in 1954, an injunction against the efforts of the County to levy upon the buildings as they were -- that's what they were listings, the buildings which were, by the terms of the lease, Government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.407" offset="2040978">And that injunction remained in effect until 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.052" offset="2067623">And so or -- the taxes levied in 1955, 1956, 1957 were all held up the administrative proceedings while that injunction was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.087" offset="2127705">Then about that time, this Court decided a case served as the warehousing case, Offutt Housing Company versus Sarpy County, which is cited -- citations in the brief, in which this Court held that in Nebraska, a Wherry housing project could be taxed at the value of the -- of improvements on the property and the Washington court, having this before it, rather blindly followed that decision of this Court and said that they were bound by the -- for the sake of uniformity and so forth they would follow the decision of this Court and, therefore, a Wherry Act housing project in Washington in this case would be taxed at the basis, that was the leasehold, will be taxed on the basis of the value of the improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.984" offset="2423306">Now, that might have been alright in Nebraska, but in Washington, that is precisely what the Washington Supreme Court, in the Metropolitan Building Company cases, had repeatedly held could not be done in one of the cases which we cite, which we quote in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.230" offset="2508257">The Washington court held in so many words that it was not permissible for the public authorities to take the value of the improvements and use those as the sole basis for determining the tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.074" offset="2591640">Now, in effect, what has happened has been that for Wherry housing projects only, the leasehold is taxed not as the statute says on its market value but it's taxed on the value of the improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.275" offset="2696443">Now, you see what kind of difference that makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.585" offset="2709713">That is the difference between whether we take about $7 million worth of houses here and tax or whether we take our interest in them, which the Government estimated at $253,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.093" offset="2775751">Now, in counsel's brief, they say they actually did not ignore the burdens on this leasehold.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.153" offset="2831966">Now, this is the first time they've said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.518" offset="2841475">And in the court below, in answer to admissions, which we pointed out in our reply brief, they specifically admitted that they did not take into consideration the $6 million worth of mortgages.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.185" offset="2900093">It is the difference between taxing the equity of the lessee and the property and taxing the property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.958" offset="2935202">If you count up what they have actually assessed, if we -- I think any court in Washington would take judicial notice of the fact that equalized values are far or less than the 50% they -- that they seek to get at but if we disregard that and get simply to the -- to the value that they have put on it, they have put a value of some $2 million on this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.571" offset="3045648">Now, we're being condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.704" offset="3050141">We'd be awfully happy to get the Government pass $2 million worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.988" offset="3067277">It just isn't that much but nobody's going to pass that because that just isn't what our -- what our equity is worth but that's what we've taxed for.</text>
