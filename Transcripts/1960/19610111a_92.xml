            <label>Mr. Robert E. Hannon</label>
            <text syncTime="24.554" offset="201540">This involves the claim by three former Korean prisoners of war for pay which they claim as owed to them under two express federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.066" offset="247620">The first to these statutes is, the so-called Prisoner of War Pay Statute, the other is the Missing Persons Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.887" offset="282937">I'd like, in commencing my argument, to read the Prisoner of War Act or Prisoner of War Pay Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.686" offset="318151">This statute is presently found in 37 U.S.C. 242.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.843" offset="338735">However, at the time of filing the petition, it was in 10 U.S.C. 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.694" offset="362141">This particular statute provides that, "Every noncommissioned officer and private of the Regular army and every officer, noncommissioned officer and private of the militia or volunteer corps in the service of the United States who was captured by the enemy, shall be entitled to receive during his captivity, notwithstanding the expiration of his term of enlistment the same pay, subsistence, and allowance to which he may be entitled while in the actual service of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.633" offset="473945">This provision shall not be construed to entitle any prisoner of war of such militia corps to any pay or compensation after the date of his parole, except the traveling expenses allowed by law."</text>
            <text syncTime="104.304" offset="520547">That is the statute in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.692" offset="530160">That statute, as I mentioned is currently subsisting legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.164" offset="551999">In the incident case we're speaking of three former prisoners of war by the facts admitted in the pleadings by the stipulation of facts submitted to the Court of Claims and by the findings of the lower court, the following have been conclusively established.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.153" offset="631933">First of all, that each of the petitioners enlisted in the Army; that is the Regular Army in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.253" offset="664430">Each of the prisoners was captured by enemy forces in Korea in 1950 and 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.738" offset="694314">Subsequent to their capture while they were still prisoners of war, they were, by the Army, promoted to corporal.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.589" offset="725765">They were confined as prisoners of war from the date of their capture until August 23rd of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.609" offset="761814">This is the admission from the defendant's answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.406" offset="772995">It is our contention that they were confined as prisoners of war until their dishonorable discharges in January of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.675" offset="810088">During this period of confinement, the plaintiffs misconducted themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.448" offset="837151">They were ultimately dishonorably discharged January of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.061" offset="867662">In 1955, they returned to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.346" offset="884799">They were arrested by the Army and held pending trials by General Court-martial for violation of Article 104 which is misconduct by a prisoner of war, and Article 105 which is aiding the enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.247" offset="948328">The District Court in California issued a writ of habeas corpus, ruling that they could not be tried by the Army as the Army had lost jurisdiction because of the dishonorable discharge in line with the Toth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.227" offset="1000260">However, the District Court did not rule that they could not be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.562" offset="1017605">They had only ruled that they could not be tried by Court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.423" offset="1033070">The petitioners then and now could still be tried in the Federal District Court in San Francisco or any other Federal District Court where they're located on the charge of treason.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.703" offset="1078209">The Army or the Government to date has not seen fit to bring these persons to trial in a civilian court with a civilian jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.192" offset="1128155">My understanding of the law, Justice Stewart, is that a person guilty of treason or suspected of Treason can be tried in any Court wherever he's located, regardless of where the act was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.567" offset="1189595">We -- in our brief at page -- from pages 10 to 16 in our opening brief, we have pointed out line by line how these -- the facts of this case fully comply with all of the conditions of 10 U.S.C. 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.563" offset="1269635">The petitioners have full complied with all of the requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.950" offset="1287189">However, when they made their demand to their back pay, the Army refused to pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.348" offset="1312789">I should now like to point out that we are asking not only for the pay from the date of their capture to the date of their discharge, but we are also asking for accrued regular pay and accrued combat pay which they earned prior to the date of their capture.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.469" offset="1393246">The Army has refused to pay any of this pay and I feel that --</text>

            <text syncTime="342.946" offset="1475166">Second, the statute that is the Missing Persons Act, 50 U.S.C. 1002 provides all pay due at the time of capture.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.726" offset="1514245">I raised it in my opening brief on pages 8 to 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.228" offset="1532322">That was the opening brief to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.457" offset="1545174">The Court of Claims had before it the findings of the commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.256" offset="1564400">It had before the stipulation of facts attached as an exhibit to the commissioner's report where the pay records or the accounting of the General Accounting Office and it's clearly spelled out there that we were asking for pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.345" offset="1620720">I argued to the Court of Claims that we were asking for combat and regular pay accrued prior to capture.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.683" offset="6250141">Is he entitled to pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.401" offset="6261008">Now, it is the Government's position in this, the pay in the military services is given only and the decisions to this Court will support me, only when there has not been a voluntary abandonment of a military obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.124" offset="6323911">And to illustrate that, I will first take up the fundamental case in this Court which is the Kelly case, that shortly after the civil war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.972" offset="6363303">Kelly was a soldier in the Union Army who deserted for two months as a result of a family situation, came back voluntarily, turned himself in, was never tried for desertion and agreed as the condition not to be tried, that he would serve an additional two months and make up the time that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.500" offset="6433416">He was given an honorable discharge at the end of his service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.035" offset="6451493">He sued for bounty pay which was denied and then this Court gave him the bounty pay and this Court tells that he had come back and he had made up his time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.550" offset="6489527">However, this Court, speaking three years later and referring to the Kelly case made it perfectly clear that in the earlier Kelly case, and I will read this Court's language, "It was not pretended that his honorable discharge subsequently granted, gave him a right to pay during the period of his absence from service."</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.768" offset="6574477">Now in Landers itself, the man came in who had deserted for a period of almost a year and was brought back by the military instead of coming back otherwise, but sued for his pay during the period of desertion i.e the period when he was not serving the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.789" offset="6654516">This Court carefully pointed out that as to back pay as opposed to future pay, the question of whether service had been granted to the United States under the military obligation was one for the Court to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.277" offset="6708433">This was a question of fact whether in fact, the service for which he was being pay -- paid was being rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.175" offset="6740093">Now, this has also been the rule in the Court of Claims and I will refer first to the two cases which involve a somewhat similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.740" offset="6786382">When a soldier is arrested civilly and in essence he is a prisoner in a jurisdiction which the military cannot reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.289" offset="6820551">And the cases in the Court of Claims, there have been pay cases which have considered whether or not he gets pay during the time he is absent without leave and those cases fall into two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.524" offset="6873422">First, if he was absent without leave at the time he was arrested even though he is cleared of any charge thereafter, he is not paid to the time of his absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.075" offset="6931623">On the other hand, if he was on proper leave or in the course of military duty, so that his absence from -- by civil arrest is involuntary in his case, he is entitled to his pay even though he had no military authority to be away during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.538" offset="7009573">So, again, we reach this voluntary concept, namely, that there is a service obligation to be performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.856" offset="7046771">Two other cases, which illustrate this almost directly, are Walsh and Carrington in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.272" offset="7072475">Here, officers were ordered to await a trial by Court-martial after misconduct and they spent some period of time awaiting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.746" offset="7114376">They sued for pay and they were rewarded pay upon the grounds that while they did nothing, their status was subject to orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.996" offset="7147395">In this connection, I call attention to the fact that a prison in a -- an enlisted man in a hospital, on leave or otherwise is always acting according to orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.685" offset="7198072">Whatever his status may be, he is in an order or duty position and the active list self in terms of pay is availability for duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.642" offset="7237987">It is defined militarily in terms of either being on duty or available to duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.724" offset="7262229">Now, that is the point at which this case departs on the facts and that is also the point on which these statutes, very clearly make a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.400" offset="7308936">I would like to take those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.387" offset="7316877">In the first place, the basic pay statute as I have read it indicates an obligation of service, of duty --</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.139" offset="7419904">It's our argument that they haven't proven that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.808" offset="7430562">We have stated in our brief and they have contested it that -- let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.362" offset="7460864">In their reply brief on page 17, they complain of our assertion, our argument that they never became entitled to pay and their argument -- I read now from page 17, “Military pay is accrued daily and paid by monthly unless there is some condition in addition to putting in time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.512" offset="7541426">And what I am now arguing for the Government as is my fundamental proposition is that there is a condition in addition to putting in time, and that is faithful service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.945" offset="7579146">It doesn't mean you have to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.019" offset="7587401">You maybe on leave, you maybe in the country, you maybe at home, but whatever condition you are, you are in a military status of obedience to orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.365" offset="7624808">You've been given leave, you've been allowed to go to the hospital, you've been sent somewhere, you're in a travel status, you've been given a year off to study, but whatever it maybe, you are as these men who were awaiting court-martial were in obedience to a given organizational order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.851" offset="7702758">In other words, they are subject to their military obligation and performing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.001" offset="7723342">Actual work of course is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.972" offset="7731284">Now, in this sense, a prisoner of war performs service also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.357" offset="7752808">A prisoner of war is obligated under the various parts of the -- of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the regulations of the army to be responsive to senior officer present in the military camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.334" offset="7808711">He is obligated to assist his comrades wherever he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.436" offset="7825115">There are various obligations and military law has always continued through a period of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.576" offset="7853641">Now, I can show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.634" offset="7857925">We have been talking here about 242 and I would like to call the Court's attention to 243 and 244, which came a few years later than 242, in order to cover the Navy in the same way that 242 referred to the army and I think the Navy here has somewhat of a more expressive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.380" offset="7960848">First, we have the condition where a Navy ship is lost or shipwrecked and the statement is as follows, “When the crew of any vessel of the United States are separated from such vessel by means of a wreck, loss, or destruction, the pay and the emoluments of such of the officers and men, they shall appear to the Secretary of the Navy by the sentence of a court-martial or by a court of inquiry, or by other status factory evidence to have done their utmost to preserver and after said wreck, loss or destruction to have behaved themselves agreeably to the discipline of the Navy, shall go on and be paid until their discharge or death.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.819" offset="8138689">In 244, they considered the fact that the Navy became prisoners of war as well and their ships were captured and the language is roughly similar and it comes down to this, “That if it'd be shown that they have done their utmost to preserve and defend their vessel, and after the taking thereof to have behaved themselves agreeably to the discipline of the Navy shall go on and be paid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.149" offset="8235969">Now, here you have in carrying material, statutes which show in essence what is meant by the word captivity in 242.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.435" offset="8277138">It is this condition of being agreeable to the discipline of the Navy, agreeable to the discipline of the Army, subjection to the senior officer present, carrying out of his orders, none aid to the enemy, non-communication with the enemy, in other words, no breach of the fundamental military obligation.</text>

            <label>Mr. George S. Leonard</label>
            <text syncTime="2082.829" offset="8434709">Your Honor, it is not at all clear in the statutory history how these three particular parts which were not passed as part of the general chapter here came to be repeated after the Missing Persons Act had been passed which takes in all uniformed services and all prisoners of war and specifically as to prisoners of war since they was a question about that before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.841" offset="8534706">In other words, 50 -- in 50 Appendix 1002 which is part of the Missing Persons Act, it specifically has captured by a hostile force and continues in that status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.894" offset="8582980">So the Missing Persons Act covers for all uniformed services in a uniform manner exactly this problem of capture by a hostile force and retention in captivity and the pay that will be owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.155" offset="8635956">I may say that the Missing Persons Act is interesting in that it goes beyond the military itself and applies equally to “active federal service performed by civilian officers”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.887" offset="8690918">In other words, this active service concept which I am now presenting as a basis for pay under these statutes goes entirely through the cases first the legislation as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.390" offset="8744939">So that under 1002, which is the Missing Persons Act, it is our feeling that the two statutes can be construed together, 1288 and the Missing Persons Act simply because 1288 speaks in terms of service and it speaks in terms of captivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.547" offset="8817560">Now, it has been stated here that it has been admitted that these people were confined as prisoners of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.120" offset="8843891">It has been found as a matter of fact by the court below, by the commissioner below, unobjected to and in fact, stipulated that these men came and went in the prison camp at their own will, that they wore uniforms of the opposing army that they used the PX which was not available to any of the other men and that they communicated within and without the camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.596" offset="8941798">And it is purely on the basis of this stipulation of fact that this question of captivity, if it's physical in its nature has been found against the claimants first by the army and then secondly by the Court of Claims acting de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.279" offset="9012537">So that they were not confined in the same sense as any of the others, they were not prisoners in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.964" offset="9039182">Now this goes back to the earlier question of Mr. Justice Whittaker, namely, what happened after their renunciation of repatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.868" offset="9078888">Well, the claim that is now before this Court is for combat pay following they're going to China and working for the Chinese and live in Korea whenever that may have been as well as basic pay and allowances while they were in fact working in China and not in any camp or otherwise from which they were repatriated later and it includes this entire period as being a single thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.895" offset="9174915">Now, had it been broken up into the period when they were prisoners of war before these particular acts started, the precapture pay which I may say purely technically is not in this case because it's denied in the petition and the Court itself note no amendment has ever been put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.428" offset="9253073">Pre-capture pay is not in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.496" offset="9261328">Actually, it's de minimus, it's really of no concern whether it's to be paid or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.637" offset="9285883">The Army has never denied pre-capture pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.180" offset="9296123">It has denied post capture pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.484" offset="9305318">If we take the post capture period and assume that up until some date, they acted as prisoners of war under the discipline of the United States Army, then we have a very interesting question, the one that was dealt with by this Court in Landers whether you should go beyond the period of faithful service and forfeit as well by judicial, not court-martial, not military or administrative, but by judicial finding of desertion early amounts which had in fact accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.858" offset="9450768">Now, my entire argument has been made on the basis that nothing accrued under any of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.963" offset="9479189">However, the second point here for the Government is clearly that under the Missing Persons Act, it is provided that no person maybe paid who is “officially determined absent from his post of duty without authority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.206" offset="9544182">Well, now, a prisoner has a post of duty in spite of the general remark which was made by counsel for the petitioner -- counsel for the petitioners because this statute only deals with persons who are missing or captured, or are otherwise in a status which can be continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.457" offset="9629236">Every person under orders has a post of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.394" offset="9644910">It may have been in the prison camp, it may have been where the senior officer present wanted them to be, but whatever it was, there is a post of duty and that duty continued whether on a prisoner status or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.660" offset="9697991">Therefore there could and was in fact found by the court below a total absence from the post of duty of these particular petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.942" offset="12795173">Yes indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.228" offset="12800293">I'm not that familiar with the case Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.118" offset="12807816">I just in fact -- I think the essence of the case here is whether or not you can have the unilateral breach of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.388" offset="12848880">Now I cite the Court's attention to -- again to page 32 of my rebuttal brief and not only citing the Grimley case, the Morrissey case, the Wilson case, but also listen to the words the Court of Military Appeals, an agreement to enlist in the armed services is often referred to as a contract (Inaudible) more than a contractual relationship is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.256" offset="12948355">What has really created is a status and as a result, no useful purpose is served by reviewing common law rules of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.590" offset="12985762">(Inaudible) status, when a person was mustered into the service and has not been mustered out of the service, he's entitled -- he is in a status as member of the military; these men have not been mustered, (Inaudible) were not mustered out of the service from 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.865" offset="13046784">We are only asking for pay up until the date that they were mustered out of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.467" offset="13069249">The Court in the Court of Claims which I think is the preponderance of the basic rule and this says aside from this, it has been held by this Court in number of cases that the mere fact that an officer or soldier is under charge, does not deprive him of allowances and such forfeiture can only be imposed by way of lawful court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.975" offset="13159320">As above stated, the uniform decisions of this Court have been that it requires the decision of the court-martial to deprive an officer of his pay and many other cases cited along those same lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.126" offset="13199862">One other quick point that being the question of did we or did we ask for the come back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.968" offset="13223267">I cite the Court's attention to pages 15 and 16 of my rebuttal brief where -- where the stipulation as to damages has laid out and the initial petition by all by demand by Mr. Brown for the back pay of these men, he asked for “all their back pay” which included combat regular pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.086" offset="13307695">In my opening brief at page 80, opening brief to the Court of Claims, I ask for the come back regular pay that's on page 85 -- 8 to 15 of my opening brief to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.248" offset="13352312">The stipulation of damages which was before the Court of Claims --</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.386" offset="13512913">One more alternative would be this fine assessment by a District Court in (Inaudible), they could find that in the District Court more than their back pay.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Hannon</label>
            <text syncTime="3367.162" offset="13572054">It wouldn't be a forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.859" offset="13578846">The only way you have a forfeiture use from the technical sense is by a court-martial conviction and under the statute cited by Mr. Justice Douglas, this can only apply now to pay accruing on and after the date of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.499" offset="13641331">I think that the proper way to dispose of this case is to refer to the Court I think the best long subject that's being left -- used by the Court of Claims in White versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.008" offset="13695352">Practically, the same issue was before the Court there and the Court states that what we think be an almost proceedings to permit this (Inaudible) to the Court we ascertain whether under all of the various provisions with respect to pay and allowances of officers men of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps investigation should obtain to determine whether as a matter of fact, the soldier had by conscientious service earned that the statutory provision will allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.268" offset="13808410">Again, I should like to repeat that I think the most significant effect of this case is the effect on future service men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.588" offset="13841742">If the army can unilaterally, administratively and retroactively forfeit a truth pay whether they say the -- they're not in the status or whether they create a condition in the statute by interpolation we have put the man in a totally untenable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.898" offset="13918960">The dispersing officer said he's not entitled to pay and wasn't entitled to pay for the past four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.568" offset="13945605">The man then must go forward with insurmountable burden of establishing that he was not guilty of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.871" offset="13978833">I think that again this is an unjust and inequitable burden to place upon any serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.138" offset="14007881">I think that the law is and has been that as long as the man is in service, he is in the status of being in the service and those persons from the status of being in the service are entitled to payment provided to the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.765" offset="14062425">The payment provided for the office in this situation, he is never in the service from the date of -- prior to their capture until the date of their -- dishonorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.164" offset="14104012">I feel that that being the case they are entitled to pay of the office.</text>
