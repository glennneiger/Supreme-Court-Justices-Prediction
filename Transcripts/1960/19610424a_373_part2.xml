            <text syncTime="38.671" offset="258069">It includes certainly non-theism.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.727" offset="262248">At the present time, I'm asserting that it includes non-theism.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.762" offset="278444">I will shortly assert that it includes atheism as well, but as of now, I am asserting that it includes non-theism which is not necessarily atheism.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.995" offset="319404">Now, originally, the Maryland law required the declaration of belief in the Christian religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.119" offset="343855">This was -- their initial form in 1776.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.829" offset="358693">In the middle of 19th century, about 1850, as a result of a good deal of agitation that passed, it was known as the Jewish law, which permitted a person who was of the Jewish faith to take the oath even though he did not believe in the Christian religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.059" offset="419610">He will stand that he should -- if he is a Jew, the law said, “He can't profess a belief in the future state of rewards and punishments.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="90.613" offset="465795">A -- a belief in the future state of rewards and -- and punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.190" offset="480110">If he professes to be a Jew, that was the exact language, but if he professes to be a Jew, he may declare a belief in the future state of rewards and punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.936" offset="511143">These brought in all Christians presumably and all Jews or at least, those Jews who professed their belief in the future state of rewards and punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.656" offset="550013">It excluded Moslems or others who were neither Christians nor Jews, then came the present law which requires simply a belief in the existence of the -- of a God.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.864" offset="606856">So that the term "religion" has been expanded originally on Christian to Jew, to perhaps Moslem or -- or -- and now, I am suggesting to the -- Your Honor that within the Constitution, it must include all those who are of a religion whether or not, that religion encompasses or requires a belief in the existence of God.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.927" offset="699120">I suggest too that within the meaning of the First Amendment, it was -- as it interpreted by this Court as barring preferential aid to religion, barring from public office of others who are not within the religious groups constitutes preferential aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.723" offset="782294">Various cases of this Court have interpreted preferential aid to encompass, for example, permission to use public parks which are barred to other religions, like Fowler against Rhode Island or the permission to use public -- schools for religious teachings or perhaps tax benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.732" offset="858258">Certainly, I think that a statutory requirement excluding from public office, all those except in the preferred groups, constitutes preferential aid to religion within the compass and meaning of the First Amendment's No Establishment Clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="247.610" offset="1093778">Well, surprisingly enough, I think the Free Exercise Clause as it was understood by the -- the Fathers of our Constitution encompass those without religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.704" offset="1130141">And I think perhaps the best illustration of that, I have some several of my brief, but I just like to read this one brief sentence from the language of Mr. James Iredell who thereafter, became a Justice of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.114" offset="1183848">And he said, in discussing in the constitutional -- in the -- North Carolina Convention on the adoption of the Constitution and he met the argument that the Article VI appeared to allow those without religion to become president of the United States or to hold office.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.191" offset="1264097">And he says as follows, “But as objected that the people of America may perhaps, choose representatives who have no religion at all and that pagans and Mohammedans may be admitted to -- into office.”</text>
            <text syncTime="302.361" offset="1312789">Then he says "But how was it possible to exclude any set of men, without taking away that principle of religious freedom, which we ourselves so warmly contend for?"</text>
            <text syncTime="313.952" offset="1359182">His -- his understanding of the principle of religious freedom encompasses those having no religion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.503" offset="1389380">And therefore, it's quite clear that he did, and that there were many others too, I think there was a good deal of discussion, as set forth in my brief, could those discussions both in the Constitutional Convention itself and the state legislatures and the state conventions as to the first, the failure to mention "God" in the Constitution and second, the opening up -- the federal office or government law office to those who do not believe in God by Article VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.262" offset="1484466">And a clear understanding of everybody there, at least it was undisputed that encompassed within the protection of Article VI, this was before the First Amendment, encompassed within the protection of Article VI are those who disbelieve in the existence of God and who have in the words of Iredell, "No religion at all."</text>

            <text syncTime="655.451" offset="2725177">I said were it not for the -- the statement in Zorach against Clauson, that we are a religious people whose institutions presupposes Supreme Being, I think it would not be seriously contended that the atheist is outside the scope and ample protection of the Bill of the Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.896" offset="2806993">This language, whatever it means, I do not think can be interpreted as the Court of Appeals of Maryland seeks to interpret it and as the State of Maryland's brief seeks to interpret it, cannot be interpreted to mean to authorize Government or federal law state, to compel a belief in a Supreme Being as a prerequisite for Government or office.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.969" offset="2899257">Were it so -- were it so, it would be directly contradicted by Article VI, which specifically prohibits such a test of -- of oath in respect at least, to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.905" offset="2959026">Now, I think the whole history of establishments both in Great Britain and the United States indicates quite clearly that a bar -- a test for -- religious test for office, was an inexplicable element of what is meant by an establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.662" offset="3054007">The -- every established religion had -- if it had nothing else, had two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.995" offset="3079398">One, compulsory support of the so-called established religion whatever it is, also important to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.351" offset="3100818">And second, either barring those not of the particularly favored religion or at least giving preference to those of the favored religion in respect to public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.318" offset="3140629">The qualification of adherence to religion as a qualification of public office is the inescapable stamp of establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.960" offset="3175215">And I think it is quite clear that when the arguments in the state Constitutional Conventions regarding the Article VI took place, the basis for the defense of that provision was that the jurisdiction of secular government, the private government, the political government under our Constitution, must be limited to the secular purposes set forth from the preamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.175" offset="3292035">That the Government has no jurisdiction -- these are -- master of phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.845" offset="3314709">It has no jurisdiction in the matters of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.876" offset="3326830">And therefore, it cannot determine public office on the basis of belief or non-belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.827" offset="3366640">It is its -- it has anyone's active government in the United States which I think marks the end of establishments, it was the Virginia Statute of Religious Liberty enacted in 1786, upon which the First Amendment of this Constitution was based as this Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.419" offset="3441037">And I think it is highly significant that the Virginia Statute of Religious Liberty proscribed as aspects of establishment, which it was destroyed to -- to -- two powers of Government, one, the power to compel monetary taxation for religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.122" offset="3531839">The other's the power to disbar from Government law office those not within the favored religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.009" offset="3555453">And I will just take this one moment to read from this great statute.“Therefore, just as the proscribing of any citizen as unworthy of public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he professed or renounced this or that religious opinion in depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow students -- fellow citizens he has a natural right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="893.213" offset="3676244">This is the preamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.319" offset="3680632">Then the upward section read as follows, “No man shall be enforced, restrained, molested or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief, but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinion in mass religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.862" offset="3754820">And that the same shall in no way diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="919.286" offset="3780524">This is what we are urging here.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.136" offset="3787943">We are urging that the State of Maryland cannot use the beliefs -- religious beliefs to enlarge all prejudice or diminish in any ways, civil capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.776" offset="3850428">Now, we also urge and this is inextricably connected with the first ground, that a law requiring belief in God has a condition for serving public office, consonant to a law prohibiting the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.135" offset="3919914">I've already suggested that the First Amendment and the free exercise as well as in the establishment provision, encompasses non-religion, non-theistic religion as well as religion, the Court need not go any further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.520" offset="3969442">If wishes to, I would go further and says -- say it encompasses the denial of the existence of a God as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.293" offset="4000580">The State of Maryland argues and it's been argued by the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.720" offset="4018239">First that (Inaudible) in the argument that the First Amendment protects freedom of religion, not freedom from religion, I do not think this is an accurate understanding of what the First Amendment was intended to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.003" offset="4067349">But more important, the State suggests that there is no infringement upon free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.013" offset="4091382">Mr. Torcaso says this -- court below in the State of Maryland, can believe or disbelieve anything he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.419" offset="4113011">He has a right, any kind of right to believe whatever he wants, but he cannot be a Notary Public or other public official in the State of Maryland, unless he declares a belief in God.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.689" offset="4158151">And the denial or withholding from him of his privilege to serve the State of Maryland in particular capacity, does not infringe upon his free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.948" offset="4211127">I think that this is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.463" offset="4225233">I think that the withholding of the right or privilege, I don't think it's important why it's called, the holding of -- the withholding of the right of privilege to serve the Government constitutes an impediment to the free exercise of religion if that grant or denial is conditioned upon the acceptance or rejection of any particular religious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.342" offset="4332753">I think there are quite a number of cases, it set forth in our brief, which indicates that the concept of free exercise of religion goes much beyond putting a man in jail, if he does not profess a particular religious belief or if he professes a contrary religious belief that the sanction of barring from public office constitutes an impairment or an infringement upon the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.925" offset="4451035">I think it's important also to note that we are concerned here not with action, but with belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.704" offset="4486144">The State of Maryland is not even going too far, so far to say that anybody who openly -- avows atheism or preaches atheism shall be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.190" offset="4524178">It demands that you believe in the existence of God and if you don't believe in the existence of God, you are barred from serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.662" offset="4558033">For the first time, a state has imposed a test in respect to religious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.616" offset="4589798">Now, this Court has said that, “Freedom of belief is as absolute -- at least as absolute as any freedom can be.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Speiser</label>
            <text syncTime="1700.802" offset="6906546">Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.929" offset="6919084">For the question as to whether atheists are permitted to affirm, there has been one decision that I know of in which the issue was specifically raised and that was a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision, petitioned (Inaudible) which summarily reversed without opinion, a denial of naturalization of an atheist, which originally arose in the District Court of Hawaii, as cited on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.832" offset="7022738">The Government confessed error on it, on the grounds that the word, “oath” included affirmation and there was no other inquiry to go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.814" offset="7054608">And there was in the record that the man was an atheist and he was subsequently naturalized by making affirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.048" offset="7083551">I'm going to discuss the questioning of the reasonableness of the classification that's been made by this position of the Maryland Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.663" offset="7114062">In order to do so, we must look at the -- the groups that are affected by it, the group that's carved out in the purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.708" offset="7138200">As has been stated, the declaration of belief in God covers all office holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.131" offset="7167875">It is not restricted to Notaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.098" offset="7175816">It's not restricted to those who give oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.549" offset="7185533">It covers the Governor, Secretary of State, judges, council men, clerks of court, register of wills, all state officers acted in general, all of them were covered by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.386" offset="7228897">The Court of Appeals below raised the question as to whether Notaries were in a different position, because they give an oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.690" offset="7254183">And the answer to that is, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.582" offset="7261706">And Mr. Pfeffer pointed out others beside Notaries do give oaths and take statements under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.551" offset="7285530">But a Notary or any of the others that do this are barely performing a ministerial duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.668" offset="7310085">It's not their function to look into the religious beliefs of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.601" offset="7333804">They aren't supposed to be religious teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.246" offset="7344358">As a matter of fact, there is a provision Article 39, which provides that various -- that individuals can make affirmations, that's the most effectual confirmation by the attestation of a divine being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.378" offset="7412903">Now, you would think that if that's the case that they would perhaps have a qualification on the part of notaries or others to have some knowledge of religious practices of what the various sects hold, what's the best way in which a -- an attestation may be made, but they have no requirement like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.466" offset="7485210">And I think that a requirement such as that would be unreasonable, but they -- they haven't done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.442" offset="7521155">Now, 42 other states and the Federal Government and England, even with an established church, permit oaths to be given by judges and the other individuals without determining if they believe in a Supreme Being or in moral accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.558" offset="7601612">The Clerk of this Court just when this session started, swore in attorneys to be members of the Bar of this Court and the members of this Court do not know whether that Clerk believes in a Supreme Being or moral accountability, that members of this Court don't know what the other members of the Court believe in this respect, even though you've all taken an oath when you assumed your role as Justices of this Court, because the Constitution forbids a religious test for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.424" offset="7725119">Now, the -- the question has been raised, “Well shouldn't you believe in the -- in the sanctity of the oath at least, which is equated by the Court of Appeals below?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.153" offset="7763989">But that isn't what the -- the oath says -- that the declaration says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.833" offset="7782693">It says that you must have a belief in the Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.696" offset="7794186">The court below equated it to include a belief in a -- in the sanctity of oath and -- and some other things perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.511" offset="7821458">Now, from this entire group of officers of -- of the State, you're carving out several -- several types of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.012" offset="7859388">You carve out first of all, nonbelievers in the existence of God.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.058" offset="7875584">You carve out nonbelievers in moral accountability under dispensation of God.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.538" offset="7897527">They took from the section covering witness and jurors, an -- an additional qualification which seems to exist and said that this is equated to a belief in God.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.141" offset="7943920">Now, this is one of the dangers that can be shown when we get into this question as to trying to determine what God is being sworn to by the various meanings of what is God and the fact that the court below appended a qualification in addition to the fact that the -- the oath, the Maryland Declaration of Rights says, “No religious test shall be required other than a belief in God.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.234" offset="8040260">They tacked on a belief in sanctity of oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.587" offset="8057710">Agnostics are barred as well, because agnostics can't say they believe in God.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.458" offset="8077249">Agnostics have some doubts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.256" offset="8084355">They don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.610" offset="8089788">As Mr. Pfeffer pointed out members of non-theistic religions are barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.638" offset="8105880">And then finally, there is the group, those who just object to test those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.947" offset="8123120">Who may in fact, believe in God, who may in fact, believe in moral accountability, who may in fact, believe in a -- a system of rewards and punishments, but who'll take the position, it's none of the business of a state to ask me to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.280" offset="8176515">Now, they are covered here, because this is a declaration of belief in God, which is required under Article 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.639" offset="8201906">All these are based on beliefs, not based on passed acts, on associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.197" offset="8220191">They're based on none of those factors, only beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.160" offset="8235969">Now, in order to determine whether this classification is reasonable, we have to look at -- at history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.547" offset="8261569">We have to look at -- at the purpose of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.641" offset="8269928">And implicit in this is the question, “Is it reasonable to disbelieve or mistrust all of these that I've mentioned?”</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.324" offset="8360626">The States are -- are barred under the Fourteenth Amendment from depriving individuals of equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.946" offset="8387166">And I'm raising the question of a classification that's made here irrespective of the -- of the First Amendment arguments that have been made already.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.540" offset="8417573">Now, the broad sweep of history is very much against the fact that we cannot trust in public office, nonbelievers or we cannot believe nonbelievers in office, who take an oath that they will support and defend the Constitution or to perform the functions of their task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.424" offset="8489044">Article VI, I think, is a good argument in favor of this point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.851" offset="8506807">We have the President of the United States, who maybe a nonbeliever, because our Constitution forbids us to find out whether he's a nonbeliever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.319" offset="8556648">Yet, he takes an oath of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.930" offset="8567097">We have to rely on his good faith in taking that oath -- oath of office without finding out whether he believes in the Supreme Being or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.298" offset="8600534">All of federal officers, all of the judges, again, we rely on this without knowing whether or not, they believe in a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.574" offset="8633657">This is an Article VI and it was thought of in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.771" offset="8662497">We've eliminated in most states, many of them did not have it, disqualification based on belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.632" offset="8689873">England, which even now has an established church, doesn't require such a statement as this of a belief in God.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Thomas B. Finan</heading>
          <turn speaker="thomas_b_finan" startTime="2778.951" stopTime="3063.619">
            <label>Mr. Thomas B. Finan</label>
            <text syncTime="2778.951" offset="11219153">Mr. Justice -- Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.643" offset="11245902">It is the contention of the State of Maryland that Article 37 of the Declaration of Rights of Maryland, which requires of anyone who might abstain to or aspire the whole public office, office of profit or trust in the State of Maryland, must take an oath or rather make a declaration that he believes in the existence of God, that this does not violate the First Amendment of the Constitution in any respect either with regard to the establishment of a religion or the prohibition of the free practice thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.794" offset="11386546">That is the first division of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.987" offset="11403368">Secondly, we contend that the appellant in this case, Mr. Torcaso, has not been denied due process of law or equal protection of the law as afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.988" offset="11451329">And thirdly, our contention is that Article 37 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution does not violate a Sixth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.423" offset="11505037">Now I would like, may -- may I please, Mr. Chief Justice to address myself to our first two divisions of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.955" offset="11547146">A declaration of -- a belief in the existence of God as set forth in our Constitution in Maryland is something which we feel is more or less an important parcel to what has been recognized as the universal philosophy of this nation that we are a religious people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.405" offset="11665011">I know that in the appellant's brief, they seem so much to treat in cavalier fashion or in their reply brief, the analogies which we have made in our brief to the parts of the Declaration of Independence, wherein it is stated and it is acknowledged that there is a creator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.782" offset="11758529">We'll refer to this very basic document of ours because certainly there, we have the voice of not one individual, but of the people speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.796" offset="11802520">Now, we know that it appears no less than three times where we recognized a creator as a people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.951" offset="11827179">And the use of the term “supreme judge,” bringing down acknowledgement of a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.899" offset="11858944">And the final clause of supplication for the support of this declaration with the firm reliance on the protection of divine providence initially pledged to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.311" offset="11912652">The supplication or the protection of divine providence is expressly set forth in the Declaration of Independence, wherein we recognize the existence of a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.760" offset="11966464">Now, in the appellant's brief they indicate that so far, so good, that it is mentioned the implication -- on an implication, but the expressed avowal of the existence of a creator of a Supreme Being is mentioned in the Declaration of Independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.260" offset="12036368">But they say there's no mention of it in the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.918" offset="12059042">And certainly there is ample reason to take that implicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.244" offset="12088299">There is the recognition of a Supreme Being even in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.873" offset="12110869">I would like to respectively call the Court's attention to a very excellent dissertation on this and the Virginia Law Review, which has been published since the filing of our brief with this Court, which is a March issue, Volume 47 and the whole line of cases treating on this subject and specifically with regard of the Torcaso case, is fully outlined in that article.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.824" offset="12214627">But at one point it states this, “A guarantee to the Constitution itself, presupposes a higher or natural law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.099" offset="12247751">Indeed the Constitution has the classic historical case of the great social contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.759" offset="12274395">And 17th and 18th Century contract theorist would be hard for us to demonstrate a binding nature of civil laws promulgated under a government created by the social contract, unless an obligation to observe that contract itself was imposed by a higher authority than man.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.702" offset="12546173">No, sir -- Your Honor or Mr. Justice, we -- I wouldn't go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.978" offset="12563310">The State of the Federal Government could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.437" offset="12573132">I -- I would like to state this and I -- I think this question resolved itself into this premise, can a state constitutionally exclude an atheist from public office?</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.314" offset="12624645">It probably resolved itself into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.038" offset="12635512">And the appellants in their brief have relied heavily on the question of whether or not the atheist is encompassed by the First Amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.007" offset="12699355">We feel that religion as defined and as not defined, but is mentioned in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, that certainly as a group, it does not include the atheist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.538" offset="12761527">It -- it certainly, we -- we have a decision and the language of the United States Supreme Court in several cases wherein they have indicated that any definition or any idea of religion must relate itself to some type of a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.067" offset="12847626">In the case of Davis versus Beason, which was a case many years ago, decided with regard to plural marriages out in the territory of Idaho and the celestial marriages as they call them, under various forms of -- resumed at that time the Mormon religion and other types that of religious sects that believed in plurality of wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.666" offset="12942085">And the decision in that case the Court says, “The term "religion", as referred to ones views of his relations to his creator and to the obligations they impose of reverence for his being and character of obedience to his will.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.411" offset="12997047">And again, Mr. Chief Justice Hughes -- Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, in the case of United States versus Macintosh, and I know that that has been later overruled by Schwimmer case but nonetheless, in that particular case, Mr. Chief Justice Hughes did mention his idea of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.659" offset="13078026">And he says, “Both the essence of religion is belief in the relation to God, involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.808" offset="13114598">I would certainly seem to take care of what are -- the appellants have talked about regarding humanism and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.345" offset="13148766">And we feel that -- that when this particular sanction is placed upon an atheist with regard to public office in Maryland, that we are not setting up some preference of religion or preference of theism over non-theism, whatever you might wish to call it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3824.615" offset="15401880">Actually, as it has been discussed here previously, the State of Maryland provides for an affirmation for a Quaker or assembly of Friends.</text>

            <text syncTime="3864.555" offset="15561644">And that goes clear back to the earliest inceptions of our Government, in this country and in Maryland, where we find that tradition just to this Court opens with the salutation, God save the United States, in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4458.571" offset="17937638">A writ of mandamus was then issued, petition for writ of mandamus was then issued and the State of Maryland through the Clerk, filed a demurrer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.472" offset="17981210">The demurrer was sustained in the lower court and a final order was passed, dismissing the petition for writ of mandamus coming up on the demurrer.</text>

            <text syncTime="4487.298" offset="18052577">However, I think the question as to what the religious belief or lack of religious belief of the appellant is -- was assumed through all the courts hated by oral argument or otherwise that he was an atheist.</text>

            <text syncTime="5266.220" offset="21168253">We, in all good faith, did not realize the significance of this because all other of our elective officers of course, do not expire at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.700" offset="21210154">They expire at another time, but the Notary Public has a two-year office whereas, our elective offices are for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.240" offset="21260309">If Your Honors please, I would like to relate to the provisions of Article VI of the Constitution of the United States, which my brothers representing the appellant contend or read into and made part of the Fourteenth Amendment and therefore, applicable to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.186" offset="21344110">We feel that this is a very violent assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.580" offset="21361664">We feel that there is no support for that provision anywhere as in the cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.208" offset="21404191">And we further feel that the terms of the Article VI manifestly, themselves, do not lead to such a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.181" offset="21440136">The provisions of Article VI, Section 3, provide that the members of the state legislatures must in their oath of office, agree to support the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.522" offset="21497501">Now, the second sentence which refers to the test oath only applies to officers under the United States, merely and purposely we say, excluding state officers because the first clause thereof, related to State officers, the second clause is absolutely silent as to state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.642" offset="21589974">And we would think that the old Latin term, “expressio unius est exclusio alterius” would clearly apply to that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5410.951" offset="21747127">Because of the manner in which the first sentence and the second sentence of that clause of the Constitution or stated, the first sentence relating to both federal and state officers, the second sentence relating purely to federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.086" offset="21807731">Now, if Your Honors please, I'd like to -- in concluding our argument, state why we think this is a reasonable provision and why it has been in our Maryland Constitution for all these years, it's been in the Constitution expressly of some seven other states and many other states in their constitutions have clauses which, “And so help me God.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.084" offset="21927685">Even the Virginia Constitution, which my brothers claim that the Virginia statutes were so pointed towards preventing their constitution on the oath of officers ends with the language, “So help me God.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.731" offset="22006262">We think that all of these references to God in this Court, in our legislative bodies by our Executive, in our state constitutions, in the preambles of our state constitutions show that this is a religious nation, that we are a religious people and being a religious people isn't it a reasonable requirement that our public officers have a religious foundation?</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.951" offset="22135202">Now, we say that Your Honors -- please Your Honor, that this does have a reasonable relation to the circumstances of life as we know them and therefore, is not an unreasonable restriction or qualification for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.335" offset="22208763">This has been shown many times by this Court in the most recent case, the Zorach case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.752" offset="22238333">Mr. Justice Douglas in his majority opinion stated that this is a religious people whose institutions are based upon the presumption of a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.060" offset="22291623">We have many other factors which this Court has upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.498" offset="22309386">In the polygamy cases in Idaho and Utah, it was so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.983" offset="22351287">Now, if Your Honor please, we'd like to just mention to the Court something that was overlooked by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.144" offset="22379917">It's a case of Church of the Holy Trinity versus United States, which was written by Mr. Justice Brewer in the 1890s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.755" offset="22418369">In that case, Mr. Justice Brewer in the opinion for a majority of this Court expressly cited the very provision that is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.789" offset="22466539">He cited this in connection with other state constitutions, which had references to the Supreme Being, to our recognition and reliance upon a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="5601.841" offset="22510738">And this is what Mr. Justice Brewer said, “There is no dissidence in these declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.204" offset="22544175">There is a universal language pervading them all having one meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="6837.700" offset="27454151">As far as this, “So help me God,” as it patched to oath, we covered this in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.277" offset="27476511">There are a wide span of oaths, some of which are set out in -- in law which have the words, “So help me God”, some did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6850.179" offset="27504097">This doesn't affect whether it's an oath or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.427" offset="27517053">As a matter of fact, in the provision of the Maryland code itself, which sets out the oath of office on page 4 of the transcript of record, they don't have the words, “So help me God” there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.445" offset="27581106">It's on top of page 4 and they set this out completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.816" offset="27598660">Now, as far as Hamilton versus University of California, there you had a problem in which the -- you had before the Court the question of the -- the right of a country to protect itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.608" offset="27633768">The war power of the State versus the religious beliefs of individuals and the Court has held that the right to be a conscientious objector is a matter of grace and that was the issue that was before the Court in University of California, the Hamilton case in which ROTC was considered a part of self-preservation of -- of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.962" offset="27727182">Now, as far as the coercion aspect of this, may I refer the Court to the Cummings case in which -- Cummings versus Missouri, 18 L.Ed 356 in which at some length, they traced the history of religious test oaths, they traced the question, the denial of public office, denial of all sorts of benefits is a form of compulsion, is a form of penalty, they make the flat statement "disqualification from office maybe punishment" and they cite the history of -- of test oaths in England and France.</text>
            <text syncTime="6941.957" offset="27871169">Other examples would be denial of a tax exemption even more of a privilege if you want to put it on a privilege basis than the -- a public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6952.847" offset="27914742">In Speiser versus Randall, you held that denial of a privilege there can infringe on constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6960.184" offset="27944103">In the Dowd case, it was -- which -- which covered political leaders that it was -- the Court said that denying office of a political leader will infringe, but they determine whether or not, that it's reasonable under the -- under the conditions that existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.629" offset="28017873">I listened.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.506" offset="28021426">I did not hear the opposing counsel say why this was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6984.276" offset="28040443">They -- they kept emphasizing this is a reasonable qualification for office and I fail to hear one word as to why this was a reason for qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="6992.522" offset="28073462">What this provision has to do with ensuring that an individual is going to do the job is going to perform the task of a Notary Public or any other public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="7003.085" offset="28115675">There was no word made in their argument covering why it was a reasonable qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="7010.617" offset="28145873">In conclusion, I'd like to say that this case was anachronism of the 20th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.887" offset="28162905">Many of the arguments that were made here were made in 18th and 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="7019.756" offset="28182444">And I urge the Court that this provision be sent back to the 18th and 19th century where -- with some emotion and fervor people argued about religious test oaths of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="7033.951" offset="28239182">Such an oath as this does not belong in the 20th century.</text>
