            <label>Mr. Gary Thurlow</label>
            <text syncTime="20.321" offset="184613">Beginning in 1949, a number of Puget Sound canneries began to equip ships with refrigeration equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.610" offset="217840">At the beginning of the summer each year, these ships would head to Bristol Bay at the beginning of the red salmon fishing season in Bristol Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.796" offset="258591">Bristol Bay is a large bay in Western Alaska, a very shallow bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.362" offset="276773">These ships would load on about seven to 17 catcher boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.247" offset="296312">These catcher boats are fishing boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.443" offset="305194">They're 30 to 32 feet long.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.622" offset="313866">They're about 10 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.693" offset="322121">These boats would be carried to Bristol Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.114" offset="335809">When the ships reach Bristol Bay, they would anchor approximately three miles from mean low tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.644" offset="373948">They would align themselves in order to give the catcher boats rooms -- room.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.911" offset="395055">They didn't want to have the anchor lines or the freezer ship followup the gill nets which the catcher boats use in catching salmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.080" offset="435702">Homer Kyros, who is the -- who was the captain of the Arctic Maid, stated that he designated his anchorage beforehand and that when the Arctic Maid reached Bristol Bay, it anchored at this anchorage which has already been selected and then the fishing effort would begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.240" offset="516368">After the freezer ships had anchored, they would launch their catcher boats and the catcher boats would fish between the freezer ships and along the shores of Bristol Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.241" offset="560358">They fish right along the beaches, right along the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.872" offset="574882">The fisher -- the catcher boats were manned by two fishermen each.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.146" offset="599960">When the catcher boat load a salmon or when the fishermen were ready to come back to the freezer ship, they would return to the freezer ship, the freezer ship would lower the net onto the catcher boat, the fish will be thrown on the net.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.123" offset="651891">The net would be hoisted through the ship and dumped into a brine tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.969" offset="675297">There, the fish will be frozen and after the fish were frozen, the fish will be transferred to another part of the ship where it would be stored until the end of the Bristol Bay red salmon fishing season or until the freezer ships were through with their Alaska operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.240" offset="748335">The freezer ships spend from 25 to 65 days in Alaska waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.640" offset="777906">The freezer ships purchase some fish from independent fishermen.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.712" offset="790235">The record doesn't indicate how many they do purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.237" offset="800371">There's no evidence at all on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.162" offset="844048">They -- they probably purchase -- purchase most of them in Bristol Bay while they're anchored from three to four or five miles outside of mean low tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.019" offset="903398">The freezer ships also carry on some operations off of Kodiak Island and in Southeast Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.563" offset="933595">When the freezer ships operate in these areas, they anchor within the three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.836" offset="954702">The freezer ships sometimes fish during the Bristol Bay king salmon fishing season.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.116" offset="983855">But for the most part, freezer ships are engaged in catching red salmon during the Bristol Bay red salmon fishing season and they fish for the most part in Bristol Bay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.914" offset="4486980">The Ninth Court of Appeals granted a rehearing at the respondent's request and they simply found that the tax was on the freezing of the fish and that this is an integral part of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.000" offset="4539329">Their theory apparently was that the loading of the fish is similar to stevedoring that the rule of Joseph versus Carter &amp; Weekes would apply to the loading of the fish and that since the fish are there in the (Inaudible) of interstate commerce when they are loaded that the activities which occurs subsequent to that and freezing does occur subsequent to the loading would also be interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.950" offset="4731173">I think the problem is in giving the proper weight to the facts and then properly characterizing the nature of freezer ship operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.948" offset="4771192">The Ninth Court of Appeals saw a freezer ship operation apparently as a freighter that calls from port to port that -- that goes from Seattle and goes to Alaska and loads up with the cargo and then returns to Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.083" offset="4823751">But by categorizing freezer ship operation in that manner, they ignored the most significant aspect of a freezer ship operation which is the fact that its very reason for existence is to catch fish by means of its catcher boats and because it does catch fish, it necessarily follows it has to preserve the fish as they are caught.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.337" offset="6588688">And if it's shipping, it's a very peculiar type of shipping because before the shipping can be done, the shipper has to catch the fish and hold the fish for the remainder of the fishing season.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.952" offset="6635186">The -- actually, the freezing and the loading is keen directly to the catching of the fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.833" offset="6658696">I think that these freezer ships could successfully operate without ever leaving the Alaska waters or the vicinity of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.084" offset="6695685">They catch and freeze salmon for the duration of the fishing season and then sell the frozen salmon to land based canneries or to ships of other -- of say a Japanese freighter, which is equipped to preserve, freeze, salt or can fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.801" offset="6786591">So, this could be an entirely intrastate operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.671" offset="6814072">I think that the leading case is all Oliver Iron Company versus Lord.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.619" offset="6837896">Here again, you have a Business License Act, an Occupation Act, a local privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.821" offset="6866631">And here, the measure of the tax was 6% of the value of iron ore produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.607" offset="6905814">The iron ore apparently was loaded on small railway cars by the same act by which it was produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.764" offset="6938415">In other words, the steam shovel or dragline, this isn't said outright in the case but I think it's -- this is only surely the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.915" offset="6971016">The steam shovel or dragline scoops up the iron ore, dumps it in the railway cars and then the railway cars are assembled in -- into trains and the trains are loaded onto barges and the barges are then sent to other States where the iron ore is unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.923" offset="7051055">Now, here you have a relatively smooth even flow of a commodity from the time it severed from the earth to the time it reaches a market in another State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.072" offset="7091702">In a freezer ship case, you again have a -- a flow of a commodity from the time its caught in -- in Alaska waters until the time that it reaches Seattle, but it's not an even flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.862" offset="7134856">It's interrupted by the fishing season.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.332" offset="7148648">The freezer ships stay in Alaska for the remainder of the fishing season and not until then do they start moving towards Seattle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.974" offset="9139284">It's a -- it's a local privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.271" offset="9152449">And the -- most businesses in -- in Alaska are taxed according to their gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.825" offset="9182647">They are taxed $25 for their -- for the first 20,000, 1/4, 1% for their -- 1/2% to 1% for the gross receipts up to 100,000 and 1/4% to 1% for gross receipts above that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.024" offset="9243460">Banks are also taxed under a Business License Act but the measure of that tax is net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.677" offset="9278046">Fish processors are taxed at 4% of the value of -- at -- or taxed according to the value of fishery products which they obtain, which they handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.394" offset="9328933">This works out very well for the State of Alaska because it results in virtually every fish which is caught contributing to Alaska tax revenues and contributing to the cost of -- of meeting the cost -- conserving Alaska's fishery resources and maintaining Alaska's fishery resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.588" offset="9421720">All fish have to be processed, cured, sold and handled in some way within 48 hours after they're caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.923" offset="9447111">Salmon are perishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.575" offset="9453693">And federal law requires that the salmon be handled in some manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.353" offset="9472815">So, by reaching the processor, Alaska has pretty successfully reached all the fish caught in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.026" offset="9507506">That's not entirely true because there is some testimony in the record that during a five today fall seining season, some vessels in Ketchikan will ice down their fish by ice at a cold storage and run their fish to Seattle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.727" offset="9690258">On the face of it, this appears to be discrimination, but it isn't because cold storages and freezer ships are not in competition with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.673" offset="9722023">Cold storages freeze king salmon and silver salmon, their trolled cut salmon, their degutted salmon, their higher quality salmon and their frozen for the fresh fish market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.602" offset="9769775">They never go into competition with canned salmon or as far as I know, rarely do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.050" offset="9791613">The fish which canneries are after and which freezer ships companies are after are red salmon, pink salmon, and dog salmon.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.511" offset="9841455">They're -- they're caught by seining vessels, they're caught by gill-netters and they're not treated this carefully as the fish which are destined for cold -- for the fresh fish market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.369" offset="9892864">Canneries are taxed at 6% and freezer ships are taxed at 4%, so there is discrimination but the discrimination is in -- is in favor of interstate commerce and it's against Alaska canneries.</text>
