            <text syncTime="434.669" offset="1842030">This, in the words Justice Frankfurter used this morning, is unseemly and if this happened very often, it would destroy confidence in the fairness and rationality of justice in our courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.736" offset="1886333">Now, I think that involves an overall view of what happened and particularly, a view of what happened in terms of the final sentence imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.516" offset="1929488">Furthermore, I don't think that the question is all one-sided.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.994" offset="1951326">Let me state first, the points which bother me about the trial taken as a whole and then the points on the other side because I think there are some on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.766" offset="1994480">The points that bother me are, first, that in any instance, wide divergence in sentences tends to undermine confidence by making the administration of the criminal law appear on part to depend on the whim or caprice of the individual judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.630" offset="2081938">And that danger is certainly much greater when you get a wide divergence in sentencing, the same man on the same indictment by two different judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.695" offset="2130108">It makes it look as if it all depended on who you came before and this is not good for the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.390" offset="2152887">And third, here, that even though I feel that this representation ought not to have been made, I say that with some diffidence about the District Judge but I do not think it was consistent with good practice, the representation that he would, someday, impose a light sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.124" offset="2227911">Still, it was made and there is, as with all of us, if the court -- the law does not keep its promises, this, too, tends to throw some doubt upon the integrity of the whole proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.728" offset="2294262">Now, if that were all, I'm not sure that I would be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.174" offset="2320071">If Judge Clark -- if Judge Hall, on having the case come before him, had said to the defendant, “I do not feel bound by this promise made by Judge Clark, the courts don't make promises, the courts act through orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.146" offset="2403976">And I feel that this was an unwise expression of opinion made without study of your record, made without learning about the crime, made without an investigation in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.684" offset="2454131">I will give you -- I'm not going to be bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.749" offset="2466356">Now, in view of the fact that I'm not going to be bound by it, I will give you an opportunity to withdraw your plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.246" offset="2492374">You can stand on your plea if you wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.431" offset="2505122">If you do, you do it with full awareness that I am going to pass sentence here after an investigation of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.145" offset="2539917">If you wish to withdraw your plea, I'll permit you to withdraw it and give you leave to stand trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="616.481" offset="2569279">In that case, I say, I'm not sure that I would be taking the position I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.232" offset="2592266">The thing that bothers me the most about this case is that the sequence of events in which it took place makes the whole thing look like an elaborate ritual for going behind the representations made by Judge Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.126" offset="2663842">And I think that that does a great threat, a greater amount of erosion of confidence in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.375" offset="2700831">Then, if the judge had simply squarely said, “This shouldn't have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.159" offset="2720057">I'm not going to be bound by it,” but instead, he forced the defendant to trial without much of any explanation and then, after trying him, imposed the 20-year sentence, four times that originally imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.039" offset="2791528">And it is the feeling I get that, I can't think of any better way to put it and yet, I'm not happy with the way I phrased it, that it became sort of a mock proceeding for the preordained purpose of quadrupling the sentence without any square acknowledgment of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.659" offset="2862059">That troubles me most deeply.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.024" offset="2871463">Now, even as I say that, I do feel obliged to say that there is a good deal that can be said here in defense of Judge Hall's action once we acknowledge that he was, perhaps, a little abrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.165" offset="2927992">In the first place, as has been pointed out already, the representations about the five-year sentence were made, apparently, without any real investigation of the case or of the man's previous record.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.368" offset="2980864">Actually, this involves a very large quantity of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.458" offset="3001240">The fifth count alleged in the evidence later shown that there were 10 ounces.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.538" offset="3033527">10 ounces, allowing for an average addict, would keep 50 addicts satisfied or happy for a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.295" offset="3072502">That's quite a lot of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.830" offset="3082742">And a -- the minimum sentence for that quantity of heroin is getting off lighter than the average sentence, which sentence is being imposed rightly or wrongly in the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.955" offset="3155153">In addition, this was an instance where Saldana received the lighter sentence by virtue of rushing in to plead before Judge Clark who, I'm informed, does have the reputation of being lenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.637" offset="3217951">Again, surely, there's much to be said in defense of Judge Hall's position that the whole case should be handled by a single judge, and he was insisting on following that practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.950" offset="12839163">And the federal agent said, “Is that the stuff?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.705" offset="13330160">She dislocated her knee and she's in terrible pain and I just must have some morphine to get her through the night.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.570" offset="13361612">And he then said, “Well, I'm going out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.973" offset="13379271">It will be just the boy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.820" offset="13386689">I've got to hurry off,” and I said, “Well, put up the prescription and I'll be down and get it in a couple of hours.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.456" offset="13413230">And he put up the prescription, marked it “Professor Cox” and put it on the shelf and then the narcotics agent came after him for a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.382" offset="13452936">I haven't the slightest doubt that under those circumstances, when neither delivery nor payment, that there were -- you would agree that there had been an appropriation of the goods to the contract and that the sale was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.287" offset="13512495">And indeed, as a matter of commonsense, it should be held to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.963" offset="13531199">Now, this one, if one were arguing it to the jury, certainly there are very sound arguments that could be made against my position, but I think that the evidence does permit a finding that there was the necessary ascent by the agent to the petitioner's prior appropriation and that this made out the necessary elements of the sale.</text>
