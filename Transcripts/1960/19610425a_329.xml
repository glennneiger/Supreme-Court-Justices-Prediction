            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 329, United States etcetera, et al, Petitioners, versus Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.668" offset="153997">Mr. Morris.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert E. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="16.338" offset="168730">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.211" offset="192240">This case involved the competing claims of the United States, this trustee of the Post Fund of VA Hospitals and Homes in the State of Oregon to the personalty of Adam Warpouske, a veteran who died without heirs or will in a Veterans' Hospital in Portland, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.802" offset="262562">The Post Fund covers expenditures for recreational and religious purposes for veterans in hospitals and homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.976" offset="295267">The Government's claim is based on the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 17 -- 17 (j), important provisions of which I'll discuss in a moment in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.502" offset="333406">The statute provides in essence that whenever any veteran dies as a patient receiving free care and treatment leaving neither heirs nor will, the money goes to the Post Fund for the sole benefit and use of these veterans left in this institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.959" offset="407176">The State's claim is based on this escheat statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.397" offset="420968">The facts are relatively simple and are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.435" offset="437164">Warpouske, a Word War I veteran, suffered from a non-service connected mental disability which he incurred during the 1920s and from which he suffered thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.249" offset="480319">Between 1930 and 1945, he entered veteran hospitals and homes on 14 separate occasions, spending a total of seven years in these institutions receiving free care and treatment for both mental and physical impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.730" offset="542281">He signed applications on these entries saying he was unable to bear the cause, he was a non-service connected case, and agreeing to leave the property within the terms of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.692" offset="590137">Now, the events leading up to his final stay in a Veterans' Hospital and the dispute here commenced in December of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.472" offset="625246">On that day, on December 31st, 1955, Mr. Warpouske was admitted to the Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland for treatment of a hip fracture and a cerebral hemorrhage.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.168" offset="664012">This was a private hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.593" offset="673729">On January 5th, 1956, shortly thereafter, because it appeared that he was without fund, the State transferred him to the Multnomah County Hospital for treatment at the County's expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.952" offset="715212">During his period both in the Oregon Hospital and subsequently in the Veterans' Hospital, Mr. Warpouske was mentally incompetent and also in the state of coma or semi-coma continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.761" offset="762441">On March 1st, 1956, he was transferred by state officials to the Veterans' Hospital in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.580" offset="793684">On March 9th, it was discovered that he just become heir -- sole heir to the estate of a brother who predeceased him in a Veterans' Hospital in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.332" offset="832658">On March 19th, 1956, he died without heirs or will.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.754" offset="850422">He left the net estate of some $13,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.394" offset="868916">The estate was paid, as they always are under the statute, the Federal Government did not contest their right to reimbursement for their public hospital care and treatment, so that for the Multnomah County care and treatment he -- the estate was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.110" offset="927848">The estate conceded to the United States about a thousand dollars, an unused pension fund and that is in -- in dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.796" offset="950523">What is in dispute is the remaining $12,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.151" offset="964002">Now, the trial court rule at this statute, on which the Government relies for support here, is based on the prerequisite of an actual common law contract but since Warpouske was mentally incompetent, could not and did not enter into such a contract, the property at personalty did not pass United States but went to the estate under this escheat statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.156" offset="1048012">The Supreme Court of Oregon on -- on appeal by United States affirmed taking the same basic view of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.221" offset="1076224">It's view with influence largely by this Court's decision in United States versus Stevens, which we shall discuss, and by certain constitutional consideration, which we shall also discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.102" offset="1119796">The Government's argument is divided in a two essential part.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.560" offset="1133589">The first is that this statute, the provisions of which can be found on pages 3 to 7 of the Government's brief, constitute a self-executing or automatic statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.029" offset="1183535">The only important considerations are that a veteran die at the patient in a veterans' hospital or home leaving neither heirs nor will and then the money vest for use of other veterans in terms of Post Fund expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.067" offset="1239646">Our second argument, of course, is that, as so construed, the statute does not violate the Tenth or Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.613" offset="1269844">Let me clear up any confusion immediately about what the statute does or does not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.913" offset="1291055">It leaves the veteran complete right to leave by will to anyone whom he selects up to the date of his death and the -- the Federal Government honors in intestate succession under the law of the State or anyone to whom he might leave by will, right to the date of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.202" offset="1356152">Now, aside from the constitutional conspirations which we think improperly influenced the Supreme Court of Oregon's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.534" offset="1385514">We submit that the statute, when analyzed as a whole, does not require a common law contract between a man coming into a hospital and that VA, the property to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.503" offset="1429400">I turn initially to the cornerstone provision on the bottom paragraph at page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.158" offset="1447999">This is the so-called vesting provision, a provision which the court below completely overlooked in its result.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.887" offset="1478928">That's -- that provision state that whenever any veteran, and I underscore any, dies in a prescribed circumstances, that is, leaving neither heirs nor will while receiving free care and treatment in a hospital or home, his personal property “shall immediately vest in and become the property of United States,” his trustee for the Post Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.668" offset="1566072">Now, we submit that the use of the terms "any veteran" show the Congress was not distinguishing between treatment under this statute of competent men, incompetent men, men in a coma, men who are able to let this man for five minutes before an operation, they were applying it to any veteran who was in a VA hospital or home.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert E. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="401.056" offset="1707551">We must interpret the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.968" offset="1715284">There is some legislative history, which I shall discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.976" offset="1727300">But the terms of the statute, we think, are clear enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.905" offset="1742973">This vesting provision, if there were no more, certainly, one cannot reach the conclusion of common law contract here.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.344" offset="1768782">And we submit in the remaining provisions that unless one can find the requirement of an actual common law contract because such a requirement would really undercut the -- the initial vesting provision, unless one can find requirement of a consensual argument between veteran and VA, then the vesting provision remains enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.940" offset="1851120">And we submit there is nothing in the remaining provisions to undercut the force and effect of the vesting provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.224" offset="1876302">On page 4, turning to the first full paragraph of Section 17, it says, “The foregoing provisions,” meaning the vesting provision, “are conditions precedent to the furnishing of care and treatment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="457.173" offset="1932100">Not a common law contract but the vesting provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.622" offset="1945893">The next sentence we come to, the court below referred to certain terms like acceptance and assignment but we must note the context are used in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.678" offset="1982046">The acceptance of care or treatment by any veteran shall constitute an acceptance of the provisions of the chapter and have the effect of an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.244" offset="2020394">It doesn't say that an actual assignment or an actual knowing, common law contract is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.602" offset="2045785">And we submit the best parallel to this kind of statute, this isn't a unique type of -- of provision, are found in a non-resident motor vehicle laws whereby service process on a secretary of state in terms of a non-resident being involved in an accident is accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.852" offset="2114748">Those laws commonly provide, and I paraphrase, acceptance of the rights and privileges of using our highways shall constitute an acceptance or be equivalent to an agreement of services process on the secretary of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.101" offset="2171800">No one would contend that if an incompetent were driving through the State and was involved in an accident that that statute would not apply nor would one contend that if a man drove through a state without a sign saying, “I do not agree,” that the statute could only be applicable if there were a common law agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.522" offset="2249435">And we don't think that this statute does anything more than that because legislatures have a certain fear of laying down rules in ad vitam, and they use certain language that says, “Certain events to us are equal to the existence of a common law contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="552.408" offset="2312965">And they often do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.323" offset="2320697">It doesn't mean that they are saying, for this statute to operate, you got to have an actual common law contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.039" offset="2347551">The conclusive presumption provision of 17 (a), as far as reflecting the intention of Congress, we submit is -- is clear as far as vesting goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.447" offset="2381197">If Congress was thinking about a -- an actual common law contract, it would've provided, perhaps, for a rebuttable presumption, so that evidence of incompetency and evidence of duress or whatever other contractual considerations could be used would be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.333" offset="2444727">But here, they say the fact of death, the fact of death of the veteran in a hospital while being furnished care or treatment shall give rise to a conclusive presumption of a valid contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.334" offset="2488717">Again, maybe inartistic, unnecessary usage of this comforting notion of a -- of a contractual result but certainly as Widmore says, “This is -- this conclusive presumption is a contradiction in term”.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.114" offset="2543783">And says no more than as a rule of law when you have the fact of death in this case and the result is established without any possibility of evidence, then all the legislatures are interested in the fact of death, and the case was established.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.600" offset="4809749">This was a 1910 Act application for membership to an old soldier's home, a competent veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.258" offset="4836394">The Government argued that by signing a form saying, "I hereby agree to leave my property," he had enacted a contract, and he was competent too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.932" offset="4867114">And the court so rule but it didn't have to reach the fact situation presented here, so that that case is no impediment to the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.224" offset="4904312">Now, we'd like to compare as a -- as a closing on the statutory half of my argument, the Stevens decision and the 1941 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.078" offset="4927718">The Stevens decision just involved, under the 1910 Act, application of membership to old soldier's homes as compared to people who were being admitted to hospitals, application to an old soldier's home is a much more deliberate process, a man can be rejected by refusing to accept these provisions on a whole to much more deliberate process in hospital admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.290" offset="5040567">And I think that contractual concepts, common law contract to pass a contract made sense from Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.077" offset="5067630">But the 1941 Act not only eliminated it all in 1910 Act's use of the terms consent and formality to common law contract but it is applied to hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.957" offset="5119248">Men like Warpouske, men who aren't mentally incompetent and come in in a coma come in everyday under emergency situation, the application here isn't a prerequisite, there's nothing in the statute to regulation that makes a man stay in a VA Hospital if he's in a critical condition based on signing an application form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.156" offset="5196048">This would be -- if you applied common law contract to this note to -- to the facts of the hospital cases, this would be an impossible statute to administer, litigation as to duress where an operation had to be performed, would a man accept, would he sign, could it be shipped out if he wouldn't sign and when he needed an operation in a Veterans' Hospital, we say that common law contract just doesn't make sense, it reduces the hospital situation almost to an absurdity.</text>

            <label>Ms. Catherine Zorn</label>
            <text syncTime="2023.363" offset="8196786">Mr. Chief Justice, this case fundamentally involves the construction of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.098" offset="8215803">And we had the statute before us and the purpose here is to construe the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.371" offset="8236805">We take it, we find it, we cannot add to, we cannot take from it, we must accept the statute as it is written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.653" offset="8261987">Essentially, the question is whether this statute is founded upon contract and the State contends or whether still operating as the Federal Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.324" offset="8296678">The facts in this case are unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.378" offset="8304933">It's unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.330" offset="8312665">This man was mentally incompetent for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.860" offset="8326771">He suffered a stroke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.886" offset="8330951">He was rendered unconscious in period preceding his hospital -- his final hospitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.283" offset="8360521">He had no heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.226" offset="8368253">He fill heirs to his property, he never knew he had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.436" offset="8381106">He was unconscious at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.263" offset="8400436">He was no more than semicomatose or at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.841" offset="8422693">Looking at the statute, we find that it is couched in the language of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.980" offset="8471280">It speaks of the acceptance of the terms or the conditions of the statute as giving rise to an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.747" offset="8502314">He speaks of a presumption of contract arising out of the fact of death in the hospital, albeit, this is a conclusive presumption that the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.569" offset="8537631">However, the statute -- the conclusive presumption provided in the statute must be examined in relation to the statute, in relation to facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.851" offset="8582771">It must necessarily presuppose the person mentally incompetent to contract just as in the case of a written instrument, ordinarily the recitals in a written instrument are presumed to be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.396" offset="8637001">However, that does not preclude going into the facts and seeing whether or not this person executing the statute had no capacity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.580" offset="8673677">A person without mental capacity cannot -- cannot execute a valid will or a contract or a deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.484" offset="8701262">It's void without legal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.953" offset="8711189">So hereto, the conclusive presumption in this statute falls for the lack of mental competency of the veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.782" offset="8758523">Going on to the -- we need not rely entirely on the written language of the statute, but we do have here the legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.330" offset="8796662">We can turn to the congressional record and find what Congress intended and that is the thing, that is the primary purpose in statutory construction to see what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.524" offset="8837517">We need not hear the line fallback on the language of statute and law but we can go actually the congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.117" offset="8867819">In this congressional record, the very question presented in this case was asked, "Does it apply to a mentally incompetent veteran for a person who's physically unable to agree to anything?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.228" offset="8920273">Congressman Rankin was the Chairman of the Committee, the Veterans' Affairs Committee who introduced this bill in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.966" offset="8947231">He was asked -- the question was raised to the point was raised whether this put conflict with state law, and he said there could not possibly be any conflict between the provisions for this statute and state escheat laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.451" offset="9001148">In his word, because the veteran agrees to this arrangement when he enters the hospital and then if a veteran were insane, it would be an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.530" offset="9037511">In that case, as the veteran were insane, in his words, the agreement would not amount to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.135" offset="9063946">When asked if this legislation would apply to a physically incompetent veteran who might be picked up and unable to agree to anything, Mr. Rankin again replied, “If he does not agree, then this does not apply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.384" offset="9116923">We have set forth -- we have set forth in our brief at page 16 part of the pertinent portions of the congressional record, at length, in order to give the comments and discussion of the Congressman sponsoring the bill?</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.044" offset="9199574">It's setting in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.954" offset="9215143">As Mr. Rankin pointed out, this bill involves only the personal property of veterans who died in his estate in veterans facilities who have no living relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.319" offset="9260596">On page 17, the question was raised as to the state escheat laws and then in Mr. Rankin's language he said, “Let me say to the gentleman from New York, there cannot possibly be any conflict because the veteran agrees to this arrangement when he enters the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.429" offset="9333112">The only exception would be where the veteran is insane, his agreement would not to amount to anything in that case."</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.582" offset="13901720">At any rate, some of the courts do not distinguish between the basic difference between the statute here, the 17 (j), which tends -- which rests in the contract and the Section 450 relating to pension funds which is a grant by the Federal Government of moneys to the veteran which it pertains the reversionary interest.</text>
