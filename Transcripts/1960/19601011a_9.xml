            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="6.402" offset="129024">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.984" offset="155355">I will address myself first to a paragraph in the Court's order for rehearing which I did not reach yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.219" offset="192240">That is the question dealing with the application of the clear and present danger doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.156" offset="231946">The question as it was stated in the Court's order reads, whether the clear and present danger doctrine as interpreted by counsel has application to the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.790" offset="290565">However, with respect to the accused, are with respect to the society, group or assembly of persons described in the statute, if that will hold whether such doctrine was or can now be properly applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.828" offset="362663">In the Dennis case, Judge Hand held that the clear and present danger doctrine as interpreted by him to meet that situation did apply to a conspiracy to organize a group to advocate violent overthrow and did apply to a conspiracy to advocate violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.919" offset="475094">And he specifically found that on the record in that case, a clear and present danger then existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.891" offset="514905">Now, in the principal opinion of the four Justices on the majority side of this Court and there was no opinion for the Court in the Dennis case, but in the principal opinion in which four Justices erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.753" offset="582405">The Judge Hand's formulation of the rule and of the application to that set of circumstances was specifically affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.949" offset="623156">The concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter however placed more weight on the congressional determination that speech should be regulated in this case and less emphasis upon the clear and present danger doctrine as applied by a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.228" offset="712286">It is our position that this doctrine should apply to the membership clause in precisely the same to the -- precisely the same extent that is applied to the organizing clause or the conspiracy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.009" offset="775398">If constitutional limitations on interferences with speech require some such overwriting limitations and the Court has generally held that it do, then it seems as though they should apply to all aspects of the Smith Act and reasonable of the application should be made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.782" offset="866513">I think that some danger in -- in making this application in the -- in the original language of the rule, I think that Judge Hand was carrying through the spirit of the rule but certainly varying it from its original applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.047" offset="943522">But for the present purposes I think that you do get a sufficient protection if you accept that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.577" offset="973720">That is, that in each case that must be asked whether the gravity of the evil discounted by its improbability justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid danger.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="1945.256" offset="7884361">Mr. Maroney says that the Yates standard was met not by what was said either by party members or by the petitioner here, but by the evidence on the party's concentration policy and the evidence as to the elaborate measures of concealment which were taken to protect party leaders and members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.507" offset="7965445">It shows inference of the purpose of these activities was to prepare for the day at some uncertain future time when conditions with the auspicious for an attempt of that forcible overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.215" offset="8016227">It seems to me that all these inferences are, to say the least very farfetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.454" offset="8037230">But even if they're reasonable, they don't help the Government's case because Mr. Maroney's error is that he confuses steps in preparation of insurrection of some future time with present incitement to forcible overthrow in some future time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.574" offset="8117687">The Yates case rejected evidence of precisely the kind that Mr. Maroney relied -- relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.036" offset="8147466">Mr. Justice Harlan said in his opinion in that case, however much one may abhor even the abstract teaching of forcible overthrow the government or believed that forcible overthrow was the ultimate purpose to which the Communist Party is dedicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.539" offset="8201488">It is upon the evidence in this record and I assume that that means the evidence in this record on the question of incitement that the petitioners must be judged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.068" offset="8243597">And Chief Judge Clark in the Second Circuit disposed of the Government's contention in the United States versus Silverman where he said and I quote him, "The prosecution stresses the proof of industrial concentration and of concealment."</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.472" offset="8317262">But these do not rationally raise any inference of the appellants engaged in a plot to advocate insurrection at the time they were hiding and seeking factory jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.043" offset="8359581">The industrial concentration possibly suggest the conspiracy to commit sabotage, espionage or political strikes going beyond mere labor proselytizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.860" offset="8398764">But it not -- does not point very directly toward illegal exhortation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.324" offset="8416632">Similarly, concealment is consistent with any unpopular or illegal enterprise, but the jury could not tell the nature of the enterprise from the mere fact of concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.293" offset="8464593">Furthermore, Mr. Maroney did not and cannot point to any evidence of the advocacy of forcible overthrow even as a matter of abstract doctrine in the limitation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.594" offset="8513703">And he has no reply to my demonstration that he can't convict the petitioner on the theory of a presumption of continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.684" offset="8554141">Now, not only is there is no evidence of party activity in the limitations period, but there's no evidence of any significant conduct by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.926" offset="8591026">My brief at page 65 -- 66, I summed up everything in this record with respect to the activity of the respondent during the limitations period and here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.152" offset="8651943">In September 1951, he solicited a $10 contribution to the party and talked about the American Labor Camp Party candidates with one witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.199" offset="8688201">In the same month, he told another witness he was going under a disguise to conceal himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.892" offset="8710980">Months later, he picked up some party publications which is -- his wife had left for him at the home of a witness and told this man that he had to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.290" offset="8744521">And in 1953 or 1955, he lived in New Jersey where he was employed by the Goodyear Rubber Company as a stock clerk under an assumed name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.524" offset="8781511">Now, how can any of that evidence be probative?</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.301" offset="8796557">Number one, that the petitioner knew that the Communist Party was engaged in incitements to violence or second that he intended to overthrow the government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.799" offset="8842533">I say that obviously it can't to prove either of those propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.477" offset="8857266">And certainly, none of the evidence in this record, either about the petitioner or about the Communist Party within the limitations period can conceivably establish to anything they were doing in this period created a danger even remotely to the Government, let alone a clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.207" offset="8944201">Now, I also want to say just a word about the -- in turning the -- the testimony about the man who was said to be on the lamb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.788" offset="8974503">That incident was supposed to have occurred in the early spring of 1951 and it likewise therefore is outside of the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.860" offset="9010761">All we know about that incident is the following, page 299 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.926" offset="9039078">That Noto said one of our top peoples on the lamb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.624" offset="9057886">He said the government is trying to frame this man and throw him in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.818" offset="9074604">He said it was over what the newspapers call was Adam's spy business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.914" offset="9091009">He said it was necessary to get this man out of the country in order to get him out of the clutches of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.394" offset="9108982">And he wanted to know if I were to give him shelter in my home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.174" offset="9120057">But the man never showed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.708" offset="9126222">Nothing other -- ever further happened about the whole business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.557" offset="9145553">There's nothing here to indicate that this man, whoever he was -- and by the way there's not the slightest suggestion in the record that he was either Rosenberg or in any way connected with Rosenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.807" offset="9190588">There's nothing to show that whoever he was, he was engaged in any criminal activity at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.377" offset="9212844">At best, they mostly have is Noto's statement that the Government was trying to frame him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.721" offset="9226219">He may have been a perfectly innocent man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.900" offset="9242937">Even if he wasn't, as I indicated to Mr. Justice Stewart in response to a question yesterday, the whole incident might have some conceivable relevance to a prosecution for harboring or some crime of that kind that has nothing to do with incitement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.429" offset="9305109">Now, just a word about the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.930" offset="9331127">Mr. Davis said Dennis found a clear and present danger in the provisions denouncing conspiracy to organize and advocate and that takes care of all the crimes under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.375" offset="9392880">But that obviously is not true and Yates itself demonstrates that that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.043" offset="9415555">Yates said that we construe the conspiracy to advocate provisions of the Smith Act as requiring proof of a conspiracy to engage in incitement now for future violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.002" offset="9471352">We don't have some of the questions of the constitutionality of a conspiracy to engage in incitement at some time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.845" offset="9506774">And we don't do it because a conspiracy to engage in incitement at some time in the future is one further removed from the advocacy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.847" offset="9542719">Now, Dennis have decided all clear and present danger questions under all offenses created by the Smith Act, but obviously there would have been no necessity for that reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.587" offset="9597680">It seems to me that the membership clause, even with all the garnishments that the Government gives it, is one step further removed either -- even from conspiracy to advocate incitement in terms of the incitement in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.979" offset="9659329">Obviously, therefore you've got to consider whether the membership clause itself satisfies the clear and present danger doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.934" offset="9699140">Mr. Davis says, "Well, it's just like a conspiracy."</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.506" offset="9713351">I tried to analyze the Act -- the statute yesterday and to show that it didn't bear any resemblance to that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.946" offset="9743130">All I want to say at this point is that it denies the defendant whatever is entitled to in a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.390" offset="9772910">And that is a jury trial on the essential issues in a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.007" offset="9791404">Was there a conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.127" offset="9799868">Was the petitioner for the accused a participant in the conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.413" offset="9817004">Did he perform some overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.884" offset="9834872">And in addition, in a conspiracy case, an accused is entitled to instructions as to the character of the evidence which would be introduced against third party declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.930" offset="9875101">Here, as I show in my brief and I haven't argued it here, time didn't permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.196" offset="9900178">The petitioner in this case was convicted on third party declarations of -- which were completely outside of his knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.055" offset="9927555">He knew nothing about and he didn't get the benefit of a conspiracy instruction that he would have had in a conspiracy case, to the effect that those declarations couldn't be used against him unless a jury first found that there was a conspiracy, that he was member of it, then the declarations and that the -- the client was also a member and that the declarations were made in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.331" offset="10016684">And all this proves the point that I was trying to make yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.824" offset="10026715">What the Government is asking for here is, is to validate this statute as a conspiracy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.309" offset="10052629">As I say employed the -- the difficulties that they found in securing convictions in the Smith Act conspiracy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.666" offset="10094007">Thank you.</text>
