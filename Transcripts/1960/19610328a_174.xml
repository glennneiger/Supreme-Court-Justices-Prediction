            <label>Mr. Luther L. Hill, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="13.799" offset="158595">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.397" offset="172910">Petitioners Smith and Marshall are presently incarcerated in the Iowa State Penitentiary at Fort Madison, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.450" offset="201122">They both attempted to file petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the District Court in and for Lee County, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.739" offset="230379">Neither petition for a writ was allowed by the Court because of the failure to pay a $4 filing fee required by Section 606.15 of the Code of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.773" offset="286490">Both petitioners attempted to appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court and the Iowa Supreme Court denied their motions to proceed in forma pauperis, apparently because of the failure to pay the filing fee, a $3 fee this time, required by Section 685.3 of the Iowa Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.717" offset="370291">Now to back up for just a minute to get the picture of these two men, Smith was sentenced to 10 years in prison for breaking and entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.034" offset="407489">He was paroled to his home in Iowa City, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.771" offset="422431">Shortly after he was paroled, he was picked up for an alleged parole violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.891" offset="446986">He was returned to the Iowa penitentiary and his sentence was there, he claims, arbitrarily extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.317" offset="480632">He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.391" offset="496933">He alleged that unconstitutional methods and procedures have been used in his rearrest and he accompanied his petition with an affidavit of poverty and a motion that he'd be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.154" offset="555969">He thereafter received a letter from the clerk of the Lee County, Iowa District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.917" offset="575091">That letter read in full as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.856" offset="586794">“I am returning your motion to allow petition for writ of habeas corpus in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.035" offset="607483">If you will mail this office $4 to cover the filing fee for the above, it will be presented to the Honorable W.L. Hughes' count, who is one of the judges in that district.”</text>
            <text syncTime="139.580" offset="661713">Smith then attempted to appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.993" offset="675297">He moved for a leave to proceed in forma pauperis in that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.545" offset="693582">The Supreme Court of Iowa denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.536" offset="705494">He then applied for certiorari to this Court, as a matter of fact, he attempted to appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.961" offset="731199">The appeal was dismissed but paupers were treated as a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.145" offset="747917">Certiorari was granted and limited to the question presented in Burns versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.296" offset="772577">Marshall, who was the other petitioner here, pled guilty to the crime of breaking and entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.376" offset="796923">He too was sentenced to 10 years in the Fort Madison, Iowa Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.110" offset="815835">He attempted to file a habeas corpus petition, alleging that his plea of guilty was obtained by coercion and do arrest in violation of the Constitution, and that the County Attorney's information was fatal on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.348" offset="868812">He too accompanied his petition with an affidavit of poverty and a motion to be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.590" offset="905697">He alleged that he was wholly without funds to pay the filing fees required.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.010" offset="931401">In Marshall's case, the Court in the Lee County Iowa District Court actually rendered two opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.131" offset="963897">In the first opinion, the Court said that the filing fee had not been paid and therefore the matter was not properly before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.440" offset="993155">But even were the filing fee paid, still the petitioner did not allege grounds on which habeas corpus in which a writ of habeas corpus could be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.333" offset="1036727">Subsequently, the petitioner made a motion to settle the record on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.722" offset="1054281">And the Court issued another opinion in which he said, “There is no record to settle on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.126" offset="1079881">The appeal can only be from the order denying the petitioner's request to file his petition for writ of habeas corpus as a pauper.”</text>
            <text syncTime="252.831" offset="1114676">So that the only paper is necessary to be presented on this appeal would be the application to permit the petitioner to file without the payment of the statutory filing fee, since the petition for writ of habeas corpus was never formally considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.345" offset="1180714">In the Supreme Court of Iowa, once again, this petitioner attempted to proceed in forma.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.069" offset="1207672">His motion to proceed in forma pauperis was denied by the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.325" offset="1232645">His petition for certiorari was granted by this Court, limited again to the question decided in Burns versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.048" offset="1271515">Thus both of these prisoners remained in the Iowa State Penitentiary at Fort Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.333" offset="1296697">Their contentions, their constitutional question raised about the methods and procedures incident to their incarceration, have not been ruled on by the Iowa District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.850" offset="1350823">The issue I think can be stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.662" offset="1370049">Can the State in habeas corpus proceedings close the doors of its courts to those petitioners who, because of their poverty, are unable to pay the filing fees required by the State statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="330.961" offset="1427205">In this case, specifically Iowa, the $4 fee in the District Court and the $3 fee in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.431" offset="1461060">Or I think the issue can be phrased somewhat differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.365" offset="1472867">I think we can say can indigents constitutionally be denied in post-conviction remedies in the Iowa's courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.831" offset="1514663">Now as I understand the State's argument, the State admits that filing fees are unnecessary in habeas corpus proceedings in Iowa, that there is no in forma pauperis proceeding in Iowa in habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.717" offset="1606196">That's what I mean, post-conviction remedy after conviction and whatever appeals there are through the criminal process --</text>

            <text syncTime="382.910" offset="1635035">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.369" offset="1652799">The State, as I say, admits that there is no in forma pauperis proceeding in Iowa in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.467" offset="1689266">In defense of the constitutionality of these two statutes, the State argues that habeas corpus is a civil proceeding and that being a civil proceeding that cannot be, the rule of Burns versus Ohio, cannot be extended to it without extending the rule to all civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.274" offset="1764498">The State also seems to argue that in this proceeding, it is a defendant and that it would be grossly unfair to require the defendant to pay the cost of plaintiff in a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.450" offset="1813191">State also points out that if the plaintiff is victorious in his search for habeas corpus, the cost will be taxed against the defendant, namely, the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.311" offset="1864600">The State also argues that habeas corpus, as used by these petitioners, is purely statutory, not constitutional and that this means that the remedy should not be entitled to any high constitutional protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.592" offset="2689755">He, the pauper in that case, Burns, received a letter from the clerk of the Supreme Court of Iowa stating that without payment of the filing fee, the motion for leave to appeal would not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.268" offset="2740433">This Court held that the State cannot constitutionally impose financial barriers on the right of indigent criminal defendants to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.370" offset="2792887">In that case, I think the philosophy of this Court was clearly stated in the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.775" offset="2834474">There is no rational basis for assuming that indigent's motions for leave to appeal will be less meritorious than those of other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.465" offset="2869269">Indigents must therefore have the same opportunities to invoke the discretion of the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.913" offset="2903019">Here the action of the statute -- of the State has completely barred the petitioner from obtaining any review in the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.905" offset="2943039">I point out that the attempt to collect the $4 and the $3 in this case has completely barred these indigent prisoners from any Iowa post-conviction procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.775" offset="3002493">Burns versus Ohio followed in time and in philosophy the decision of this Court in Griffin versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.516" offset="3029452">Griffin versus Illinois again was a criminal appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.418" offset="3045021">In that question at issue was the cause of a transcript of a record on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.891" offset="3070934">This Court held that the State must furnish either a transcript or an adequate substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.655" offset="3101968">It might be pointed out that in Griffin versus Illinois, the challengers on appeal to the -- by the indigent prisoner where a challenger is base on errors, mere errors committed by the trial judge at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.177" offset="3172080">They were not challengers based on constitutional questions as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.890" offset="3198934">Now it seems clear I think that in criminal cases, this Court, when the issue is presented, has gone very far in saying that rich and poor must be treated alike, that filing fees, cost of transcripts must not be allowed to interpose between the criminal defendant and the prosecution of his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.523" offset="3297468">The distinction between the Griffin versus Illinois and Burns versus Ohio, as the State has correctly pointed out, is that habeas corpus has long been held to be by most courts a civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.076" offset="3359640">This Court in the matter of Tom Tong, in 108 U.S. quoted in both briefs said that civil -- that habeas corpus was a civil proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.308" offset="3740609">Now in one state at least, in Kansas, in Gleeson versus Commissioner which is cited on page 15 of the petitioner's brief, the Kansas court said that at least in cases like this, where criminal prisoners were involved who were seeking habeas corpus; habeas corpus was criminal or essentially criminal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.235" offset="3840293">If that route were followed by this Court, of course, there would be no distinction, I suppose, between Burns versus Ohio and Griffin versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.137" offset="3875924">But assuming that that route is closed by virtue of the decisions like Tom Tong, we move on, I think, to a consideration of the nature of habeas corpus itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.834" offset="3922735">Habeas corpus may very well be a civil remedy, but I submit to you, it is no mere civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.727" offset="3954291">It is long been recognized by this Court as an essential element in the whole fabric of our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.940" offset="3991176">In Darr versus Burford, for example, the Court said, “The writ of habeas corpus commands a general recognition as the essential remedy to safeguard a citizen against imprisonment by a State or Nation in violation of his constitutional rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="988.011" offset="4055437">The same kind of language appears in Bowen versus Johnston, 306 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.872" offset="4082813">It must never be forgotten that the writ of habeas corpus is the precious safeguard of personal liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.340" offset="4108727">And there is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.303" offset="4128580">I think the popular view of habeas corpus is, perhaps, expressed by the read along quotation which I certainly shant read from Hendrick which appears on page 16 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.734" offset="4174346">The whole idea being, popular idea being that as long as the writ runs, nothing like Hitlerian arrest can exist in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.190" offset="4212172">The importance of the writ, I think is evidenced by the fact that it is found in the United States Constitution not in the Bill of Rights, been in Article 1, Section 9 and its inclusion there was pointed to by Hamilton in the federalist as being one of the reasons why there wasn't a need for a Bill of Rights because this protection was already in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.973" offset="4295241">It is found in Article 1, Section 13 of the Constitution of Iowa, and it is found in the constitutions of a number of the other states of the union, and I suspect but for the poor facilities available in the morning perhaps in all of the Constitutions, the states where I found the provision are listed on pages 18 and 19 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.756" offset="4394402">With all of these background, with all of this feeling about the great writ and the freedom writ, it seems that you are here considering the extension of a rule, the rule of Burns versus Ohio, to a cause of action, to a remedy which is not ordinary, which is not a mere civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.545" offset="4473501">And which gives you a very good ground to distinguish between habeas corpus and all of the other civil actions trespass, (Inaudible) and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.829" offset="4522715">Now this has been done by one state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.259" offset="4540374">In Barber versus Gladden, a decision by the Supreme Court of Oregon, Barber sought a writ of habeas corpus against the warden or the prisoner in which he was imprisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.619" offset="4581857">He moved for an order authorizing the judge to direct the county treasurer to post in undertaking on appeal and to pay all fees and cost on appeal, or in the alternative, to order the requirement waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.155" offset="4639953">An affidavit of poverty accompanied this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.747" offset="4654373">The Supreme Court of Oregon held, it said by necessary implication of Griffin versus Illinois, that the statutes requiring an appeal barring were unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.998" offset="4719365">The Supreme Court of Oregon said, it maybe -- that a distinction will be suggested between the two cases, namely, Griffin versus Illinois and this case, because Griffin versus Illinois was a criminal appeal whereas Barber's appeals is a civil action for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.158" offset="4791986">But the argument cuts the wrong way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.906" offset="4802957">To be sure, habeas corpus is in form a several proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.943" offset="4819153">But it is one based upon the provisions of the Oregon constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.446" offset="4837125">Its function as applied to persons imprisoned for crime is to afford relief from confinement under a void judgment, a wrong which transcends in seriousness mere errors of law at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.661" offset="4893968">Parking back again, of course, to what was at issue in Griffin versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.561" offset="4917582">Now unfortunately, as far as I've been able to find, Oregon is the only state that has done this, but there have been two cases, the case in the District Court and the cases in the Ninth Circuit of Appeals coming out of Oregon and therefore, governed by the Oregon law, the same prisoners involved, and both cases, namely, Daugharty v. Gladden in page 21 of the brief in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.297" offset="5040567">There the Federal District Court stated the question whether it was necessary in a habeas corpus proceeding to pay fees to the counting clerk to obtain the transcript of record, whether that requirement of the Oregon law was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.808" offset="5114650">The District Court stated that such a requirement was unconstitutional, citing Griffin versus Illinois and Barber versus Gladden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.104" offset="5147773">But the Court want to held -- want to -- where they had to hold that the state court remedies have not been exhausted that this prisoner could turn to the Supreme Court of Oregon for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.595" offset="5205765">That case was then appealed to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.588" offset="5221752">The Ninth Circuit first reversed the District Court and held that the state court remedies had been exhausted pointing out that there has been six proceedings in the Federal District Court, five proceedings in the state courts, and one proceeding in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.032" offset="5287476">And that all of these together amount into a real exhaustion of the state court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.893" offset="5310986">Then the Ninth Circuit went ahead to say that the dismissal of the state court appeal because a plaintiff's inability to furnish an appellate transcript deprived him of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment quoting directly, “We hold only that those state processes ought to be made available to rich and poor alike.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.320" offset="5404609">The case was remanded to the Federal District Court to allow Oregon a reasonable time in which to take action and conformity with the opinion barring which the prisoner was to be release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.927" offset="5455078">Therefore I think there are presently two cases, one in the Oregon Supreme Court, one in the Ninth Circuit following apparently the Oregon law, both of which hold that in habeas corpus proceedings, the State may not, under Griffin versus Illinois, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause thereof, may not constitutionally interpose financial barriers between a prisoner and habeas corpus proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.585" offset="5565733">Now the State, of course, argues that if you extend the rule of Burns versus Ohio to habeas corpus, you will extend it to all civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.421" offset="5613066">I would submit respective to you that that does not necessarily follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.509" offset="5637413">As we have seen habeas corpus is not a mere civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.164" offset="5656012">I think you have a line of distinction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.145" offset="5671999">It is obvious that the extension was so limited in Barber versus Gladden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.036" offset="5699480">This distinction that I am suggesting, the distinction which is built on the personal liberty, on the very nature of this writ and the importance of the writ, as suggested by former Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in an article on page -- that's quoted on page 25 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.981" offset="5779310">It was suggested by Judge Hamley of the Ninth Circuit, a distinction which makes of habeas corpus an action so important at least when used in this context that the state should not be allowed to interpose these financial barriers between the writ and the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.190" offset="5860080">Now I think this whole problem can be approached from a slightly different point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.748" offset="5886412">It is a point of view that I alluded to earlier and that in response to a question that was put to me, to some extent came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.499" offset="5933328">Namely, I believe it is the law as stated by this Court that the states must of necessity under the Fourteenth Amendment provide some kind of a post-conviction remedy for imprisoned prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.668" offset="6006053">Now certainly, this is the feeling of the law enforcement official to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.242" offset="6028309">I've quoted on page 27 of the brief a statement of a special committee on habeas corpus report to the conference of Chief Justices residing from a California report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.739" offset="6090376">There they said that any proposition can be stated dogmatically in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.210" offset="6108244">It is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.575" offset="6113677">State courts must provide post-conviction corrective processes which is at least as broad as the requirements which will be enforced by the federal courts in habeas corpus through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.313" offset="6172609">A State can call this remedy whatever it wants but it must provide some corrective process, see Mooney versus Holohan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.748" offset="6218376">Now candor compels me to admit to you that Mooney versus Holohan, to my opinion, does not go quite that far, although it goes quite far I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.973" offset="6263306">However in Young versus Ragen, an Illinois prisoner attempted to obtain a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.526" offset="6293504">This writ was denied by the Illinois court without a hearing because it was insufficient in law and substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.763" offset="6330389">This Court speaking through Chief Justice Vinson said, “Of course we do not review decisions which rest upon adequate nonfederal grounds, and, of course, Illinois may choose the procedure it deems appropriate for the vindication of federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.774" offset="6394441">But it is not simply a question of state procedure when a state court of last resort closes the door to any consideration of the claim of denial of federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.505" offset="6437386">And what is the effect of the denials of habeas corpus in the number -- and that is the effect of the denials of habeas corpus in a number of cases now before this Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.879" offset="6474898">“Unless habeas corpus is available, therefore, we are led to believe that Illinois offers no post-trial remedy in cases of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.542" offset="6517530">The doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies to which this Court has required scrupulous adherence of all federal courts presupposes that some adequate state remedy exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.061" offset="6559640">We recognize the difficulties with which the Illinois Supreme Court is faced in adapting available state procedures to the requirement that prisoners be given some clearly defined method by which they may raise claims of denial of federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.293" offset="6620557">Nevertheless, that requirement must be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.850" offset="6638738">If there is now no post-trial procedure by which federal rights may be vindicated in Illinois, we wish to be advised of that fact upon remand of this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.769" offset="6682415">If the states must furnish a post-conviction remedy for prisoners, then I think it clearly follows that that post-conviction remedy, if the teaching of Burns versus Ohio and Griffin versus Illinois means anything, that post-conviction remedy cannot be limited only to the rich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.904" offset="6766947">It must be available to the poor and the rich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.819" offset="6778650">It seems to me that is the philosophy of the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.712" offset="6798190">Now let me say that in Iowa there is a post-conviction remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.805" offset="6814595">It is habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.848" offset="6822745">It is available to any prisoner of the Fort Madison Penitentiary who has $4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.850" offset="6842807">It is not available to these two prisoners because they do not happen to have $4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.738" offset="6870288">The State argues that this doesn't make any difference because the petitioners have now exhausted their state remedies and can go to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.881" offset="6910934">It is true of course that in the federal courts there is an in forma pauperis proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.305" offset="7016573">Whether these -- I think for the purposes of this hearing, we must accept those affidavits as true, and in both cases they allege that they do not have the funds with which to pay the $4 fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.825" offset="7074670">This is something -- in the Lee County Iowa District Court, this is something that the Court had considered these affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.453" offset="7097135">It's certainly could have made an investigation to determine whether in fact the affidavits were true but this has not been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.999" offset="7127333">And so now as in the present posture of the case, I think we must accept the statements as being true, namely, they don't have $4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.716" offset="7186265">Now the federal courts probably will be open to these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.110" offset="7207790">I might point out however that Iowa is in the Eighth Circuit and that it is the Eighth Circuit opinion, Willis versus Utecht cited on page 8 of the State's brief that seems to hold that exhaustion of state remedies is not shown merely because of the poverty and consequent inability of the petitioners for writ of habeas corpus to obtain habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.389" offset="7316877">In that case which involved a Minnesota prisoner, the Ninth Circuit -- the Eighth Circuit said, “The proper procedure under Minnesota law” and this after the affidavits of poverty were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.445" offset="7373197">“The proper procedure under Minnesota law was to file an application for such a writ with filing fees in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.483" offset="7401305">And that the decision of that Court was adverse then was appealed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.635" offset="7537873">Now whether they are saying that they don't believe the affidavit of poverty which is possible and that if the affidavit of poverty had been true, the Minnesota court would have allowed the writ under the special circumstances Your Honor, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.024" offset="7583431">But at any rate, I think the thing to observe here is that in Eighth Circuit it's not altogether clear that these two petitioners can go to the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.638" offset="7613942">It's not altogether clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.579" offset="7625644">Now not only is that an area of perhaps some little doubt, but I think that it has been one of the hallmarks of our system that one set of court should have do regard for another set of courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.659" offset="7702026">As I understand the opinions of this Court, it has been the view of this Court that it would be unseeingly for a Federal District Judge to pass on the decision of a Supreme Court of State without giving -- or the courts of a State without giving the Supreme Court or the upper courts of that State an opportunity to pass on the alleged errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.304" offset="7788544">That's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.069" offset="7795649">The allegation is in the petitions for a writ are based on the actions of Iowa law enforcement officers, Iowa police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.513" offset="7825429">And it seems altogether fitting on pauper that those allegations of unconstitutional acts should first be passed on by the Iowa courts before the matter is referred to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.095" offset="7891780">Now I think the State's argument avoids another issue which seems to me to be at the heart of these cases, namely, the distinction between those who have $4 and those without.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.275" offset="7940472">I've alluded to this already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.146" offset="7951966">As I said, Iowa courts are open to everyone with $4, apparently, $4 plus $3 when you go to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.607" offset="7985821">They apparently are close to those who do not have the $4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.628" offset="8013928">The fact of the matter is that in Iowa there is a post-conviction remedy, a post-conviction remedy for prisoners with the means to obtain that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.534" offset="8053530">That set of prisoners can go through the Iowa courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.589" offset="8065755">The other set of prisoners, namely those without the $4, are to be sent to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.169" offset="8088012">It seems again that this is exactly the kind of an invidious discrimination or characterization which this Court struck down in Burns versus Ohio and Griffin versus Illinois.</text>

            <label>Mr. Evan Hultman</label>
            <text syncTime="2531.165" offset="10228067">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.659" offset="10246040">I would have to, at the outset, conclude earlier by this battery of attorneys to as present together with the court reporters that both the petitioner here and the respondent are indeed paupers at least in comparison with the number of attorneys and counsel that are involved as far as the prisoner is concerned here today and the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.348" offset="10336737">But I'm sure the Court will agree that the brevity of the briefs in this particular instance and that the lack of counsel as far as numbers, in no way, are a reflection on the importance of the issue which is before this Court and as being presented here today in the form as far as the two briefs are concerned, and most briefly in the case of respondent to wit ten pages and three lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.596" offset="10445720">The State, at the outset, admits the first proposition of the brief of the appellant here that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus cannot be filed in Iowa, nor can an appeal be taken in habeas corpus proceedings until filing fees are first paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.840" offset="10550732">I would hope here that the Chief Justice would be as kind to the State of Iowa as to the State of Illinois when he stated in the case at bar which is the primary case, the Ohio case that we're referring to when he stated that the State's commendable frankness in this case has simplified the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.930" offset="10631084">Let it be known at the State of Iowa secondarily at this point, admits all of the items of record that have been alluded to by counsel with reference to the procedures, which took place up to the time this case has been presented to the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.788" offset="10702555">But gentlemen, the State here prays that although the State of Iowa will be left upon in the same way that they'd be blessed with the different and a contrary decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.053" offset="10755636">That in the case of the Burns case which is the primary one to which it has been eluded here and which the Court has brought to the attention in granting this writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.947" offset="10799208">Because it is the contention of the State of Iowa that we have two different cases all together involved presently from the Burns case, and the Griffin case, or in the case of Burns and Griffin, these two cases were concerned with one direct attack, if you please, direct attacks upon two criminal convictions, through the processes of three criminal appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.586" offset="10925746">None of which are we concerned with here today as far as the issues which are acquired in the case before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.647" offset="10962004">I would like to allude first of all to a premise with reference to the case of the State of Ohio that was referred to a little earlier here by one of the justices and was referred to shortly in Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.849" offset="11022817">Where it has been stated by men of this Court in by other members of this Court in previous years, that a State does not have a duty under the Constitution of the State of -- of the United States nor under the Constitution of the State of Iowa, in this particular instance, to provide even a method of appeal, let alone a post criminal conviction remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.310" offset="11124590">The State does not even have to provide this as stated by members of this particular court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.789" offset="11146533">But as this Court has positive, what you do provide and here again, get back to the box of the Burns and the Griffin cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.637" offset="11185925">If you do provide in the State of Iowa or in the State of Ohio in the case of Burns, or in the State of Illinois in the case of Griffin, then you must provided equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.845" offset="11234722">Gentlemen of this Court in Iowa, paupers are allowed to appeal from criminal convictions without the prior payment of filing fees by a statute, by a statute almost 100 years ago recognizing the basis that this Court in its decision in Burns long before this Court brought this case to the attention of the 50 states of this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.943" offset="11335137">Secondarily, likewise by a statute, State of Iowa provides again more than 100 years ago that filing fees and transcripts of record are a matter to be provided at state cost to a pauper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.440" offset="11397099">But again differentiated completely in accordance with the Burns and Griffin cases in cases of direct attacks upon criminal convictions and criminal appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.041" offset="11451538">Now I submit to this Court that here today we have an entirely different question being submitted and was ever submitted in Burns or in Griffin, because here are concerned with the nature of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.948" offset="11527189">Iowa already provides for statute what is required by Burns and Griffin by this particular court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.006" offset="11551431">So we must lock to the nature of the writ itself, and it is the contention of the State of Iowa that the nature of the writ of habeas corpus has from its very beginning, all through the period of history and to its present day been a civil action to gain a civil remedy, and this has been well settled by this Court and by other courts including the Supreme Court of the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.420" offset="11669086">Nowhere as the definite distinction between habeas corpus and criminal prosecution, then we're clearly set forth, then by this very Court in, ex parte Tom Tong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.784" offset="11722480">I would like to quote because this is a very short decision but I think it's very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.101" offset="11743796">And I would disagree with the good Justice Frankfurter when you mentioned earlier a question that we have a different issue involved here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.281" offset="11776502">I believe we have the same issue as far as the nature of the writ itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.190" offset="11796146">The Court stated on this occasion that proceedings to enforce civil rights or civil proceedings and proceedings for the punishment of crimes are criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.709" offset="11846196">In the present case, as the Court in Tom Tong was referring, and it was a criminal case, a criminal case where a poor Chinese store merchant was in violation of an ordinance of the City of San Francisco and a criminal charge had been brought against him and he sought the writ, the great writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.345" offset="11928743">And the Court said in the present case, the petitioner has held under criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.182" offset="11948074">The prosecution against him is a criminal prosecution, but the writ of habeas corpus which he has obtained is not a proceeding in that prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.490" offset="11993318">On the contrary it is a new suit, a new suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.330" offset="13024737">And so if you follow this thinking, this reasoning, then most certainly we must throw out the entire thinking of statute of all courts on the issue of bail, because here we are depriving a man before a court is even in a jury rendered a decision or a criminal appeal taken by direct access to the appellate courts before there has been a determination, if you please, of the man's innocence or guilt.</text>
