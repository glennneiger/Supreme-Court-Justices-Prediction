            <text syncTime="21.588" offset="189733">Mr. Horsky.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_a_horsky" startTime="22.559" stopTime="493.064">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="22.559" offset="193599">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.604" offset="209795">This case is a direct appeal from a decision by the District Court for the Southern District of New York denying the appellants' motion to intervene in a proceeding pending before that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.678" offset="274056">At the last term, this Court postponed the question of its jurisdiction to this hearing on the merits, and I will perforce discuss the question of jurisdiction at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.263" offset="328391">I trust, however, the Court will grant me a few minutes to set the question of jurisdiction in its perspective by a recitation of the facts upon which this case arises in the nature of the proceeding and of the motion that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.796" offset="398608">The proceeding in which intervention was sought was an antitrust action brought against the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, its officers and directors and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.522" offset="461511">ASCAP, which is the common shorthand for that long name, is a -- an unincorporated association composed of music writers, lyric writers and music publishers who assigned to it licenses for the public performance of their works and who received from it, a distribution of the license fees which it collects.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.614" offset="573837">The appellants, I should add, are three publisher members of ASCAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.141" offset="599960">The antitrust action against ASCAP was commenced about 20 years ago in February 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.535" offset="637471">The complaint in the case alleged two areas in which the actions of the Society and its members were alleged to contravene Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.344" offset="696717">One of the areas concern the relationships between the Society and its membership with its licensees or prospective licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.203" offset="740185">That area is not involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.214" offset="760247">I think all parties are agreed that we can put that aspect of the antitrust case to one side.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.832" offset="786683">The other area which was alleged in the original complaint concerned the relationships, the competitive relationships arising as between the members of ASCAP and among the members of ASCAP itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.686" offset="850108">The complaint alleges that the directors had the power to control the operations of the Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.297" offset="880515">The articles of association of the Society gave this self-perpetuating Board of Directors, the power to determine, in effect, the competitive standings and relationships among the members by virtue of its practically unlimited power to determine how the fees of the Society should be distributed to the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.163" offset="972048">About a week after the complaint was filed in 1941, a consent decree was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.726" offset="1002245">In respect of the matters with which we are concerned here, it did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.207" offset="1028159">It first provided that the directors should be elected by the membership of the Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.811" offset="1058565">It also laid down certain general standards which were to govern the manner in which the distributions of the license fees were to be made to the Society's membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.078" offset="1111646">These generalized admonitions in the 1941 decree against the actions of the dominating Board of Directors soon to prove to be quite inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.636" offset="1169951">And in 1950, on the motion of the Department of Justice, but again by consent, a second decree was entered in the suit, known as the 1950 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.631" offset="1221883">This decree made somewhat more specific, the basis upon which the revenues of the Society where it would be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.299" offset="1252603">It recited that it was one of the purposes of the action to ensure a democratic administration of the Society, and it therefore required certain somewhat more detailed requirements in the articles of association regarding the manner in which the directors where to be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.710" offset="1334209">Within a few years, the continuing course of complaints from the general membership of the society caused the Department of Justice again to look into the operations of the Society and the manner in which the directors had succeeded in continuing their position of domination over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.201" offset="1420204">The investigation began in 1956 and by 1958, the Department of Justice had concluded that notwithstanding two consent decrees, the antitrust purposes of the action had not been achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.458" offset="1485197">Indeed, the plaintiff, the smaller publisher members of the Society, was such that the small business committee of the House of Representatives also conducted an investigation of the Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.722" offset="1534307">The 700 odd page record of those hearings and the committee reports are referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.800" offset="1566595">The 1950 decree, the 1950 consent decree, in addition to the usual retention of jurisdiction provisions, common in antitrust consent decrees, expressly reserved to the Department of Justice the right at any time after 1955 to move in the District Court in New York for a modification of the 1950 decree in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.988" offset="1679339">By 1958, the information which the Department had itself get, as its counsel told the Court and the information which had been unearthed by the congressional investigation had brought the Department to the conclusion that it should move for further modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.470" offset="1761259">I think it will be helpful to further give you an -- an understanding what follows if I quote one short paragraph of the report made by the Department of Justice to the District Court at the time that the proposed amendments which, I will come to in a moment, were represented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.124" offset="1839835">This is the situation as of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.022" offset="1851434">I am reading from page 140 at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.914" offset="1875048">"ASCAP's Board of Directors, as here and before stated, has established a distribution system which has the effect of favoring certain members at the expense of others, and at the same time, ASCAP has waited the votes of its members so as to provide that those members who received the greatest share of its revenues shall also have the largest number of votes."</text>
            <text syncTime="469.325" offset="1980688">The vice of the system is that it gives those members in ASCAP who received the largest share of ASCAP's revenues, the power to elect the directors of the Society who in turn have the power to establish the rules governing the Society's system of distribution which in turn determines which member shall receive the largest share of the Society's income.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.134" offset="2139930">You will also notice on that same page 140 that -- that same report advised the Court that at the -- under this 1950 decree which sought to democratize the affairs of the Society, the directors had succeeded in providing a system under which 99% of the total publisher membership of the society did not have the combine power to elect a single director, and this after two consent decrees.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.936" offset="2335117">Yes, the Board of Directors is, really, two boards, 12 members elected by the publishers and 12 members elected by the writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.424" offset="2365106">The -- the report points out 95% of the writers could not elect a writer director, 99% of the publishers could not elect a publisher director.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.956" offset="2423202">Now, instead of pursuing its original intention to move in the District Court for a modification of the consent decree, the Department in 1958 acceded to a request that it enter into negotiations with the Society, so its Board of Directors and counsel selected by term for still another consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.400" offset="2508988">By mid-1959, approximately June 1959, the Department had reached what its counsel told the lower court was a compromise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.869" offset="4646849">The last one prior to this raised one of the questions, which I think is quite or perhaps worth a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.916" offset="4679032">An attempt was made to intervene in 1956 by some people who were interested in the manner in which they thought the Departments were -- were premising the directors to avoid and evade the 1950 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.574" offset="4741622">The Court at that time said, "As far as I can see, the Department has advised me if it's investigating, if there is need for action, it will take it and therefore, I don't see any reason why you need to come in."</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.090" offset="4779760">That was the -- the sort of a context in which the last petition to intervene was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.514" offset="4817377">Now, a moment on the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.618" offset="4837857">In view of the fact that the Department of Justice has reconsidered the position which it took in its motion to dismiss this appeal at the last term and now concurs with appellants that the Court does have jurisdiction, I think, I can, perhaps, abbreviate what I might otherwise say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.501" offset="4921344">But anyway, let me summarize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.122" offset="4927822">We and the Department are now both of the opinion that when intervention is claimed as a right under Rule 24 (a), as distinguished from intervention claimed permissively under Rule 24 (b), the order of the lower court denying intervention is an appealable order.s</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.268" offset="5012459">We are further in accord that under those circumstances, the question of jurisdiction and the question on the merits, in effect, colorless, that is, if the Court were to decide that the order of the lower court denying intervention was a proper order, it would dismiss the appeal rather than affirm the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.141" offset="5119979">On the other hand, if it were to conclude that the order of the lower court was erroneous, it would have jurisdiction to reverse the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.169" offset="5156028">An example of the formal situation is the Sutphen Estates case in 342 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.579" offset="5181733">Examples of the latter cases are the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen in the 322 U.S. and the Missouri-Kansas Pipe Line Company case in the 312 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.085" offset="5231679">In the former case, the appeal was dismissed upon the conclusion that the intervention was properly denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.172" offset="5264071">In the latter two cases, the decision below was reversed upon the conclusion of this Court that intervention was improperly denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.691" offset="5722154">Now, one -- before I come to the merits, one -- one more preliminary word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.892" offset="5742947">As I said, the District Court decided the case without making any findings of fact on the allegations and offers of proof made by the appellants in our moving papers and in our supporting memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.632" offset="5797909">As I understand the question that was before the District Court and indeed as I understand the question is -- which is before this Court, the issue is as a matter of law, where those allegations adequate to warrant intervention?</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.068" offset="5855692">Now, the first of the requirements of the rule, obviously, is that the representation of the applicants' interest by the existing parties is or maybe inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.476" offset="5909295">The existing parties within the terms of the rule were the Board of Directors of ASCAP and the Department of Justice, the considerations which -- which bear upon whether the representation by either of those parties was adequate or obviously different with the Court's permission, I would proceed first to discuss the question of the directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.662" offset="6013994">Appellant's basic position as to the adequacy of representation by the Board of Directors is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.657" offset="6045968">They alleged in their pleadings and offer to prove that the Society's Board of Directors was dominated by the very group of large publisher members which it was the purpose of the antitrust suit to curve and bring under control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.295" offset="6120573">The directors were the representatives of the very group that appellants sought to prove should be restrained much more than the proposed decree proposed to be restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.172" offset="6168012">On the phase of it, appellants' interests and the interests of the directors were directly antagonistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.507" offset="6197373">And consequently, we submitted that they could not properly be said to representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.519" offset="6221406">Now, in this Court, it is argued by counsel for ASCAP that the Board of Directors did in fact represent the appellants because in a membership vote taken under the direction of the District Court following the proceedings in the Court, a majority of the members of the Society ratified or voted yes on the proposals to amend the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.191" offset="6348152">Let me give you a word of background before I approach that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.176" offset="6372080">Following the hearing -- I should say that at the return date, there was a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.217" offset="6392247">The District Judge himself said he'd like to have it -- he like a town meeting with himself as the town boss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.301" offset="6420564">But there was a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.486" offset="6429341">And at the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered that a -- ballots be submitted to each member of ASCAP, publisher as well as writer, on which he could mark either yes or no to the question, "Do you approve the proposed amendments?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.993" offset="6515336">Each member was entitled to one vote on this ballot, although there was a weighted ballot also taken at the same time to comply with the Society's articles of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.653" offset="6557968">In this non-weighted vote, a majority of the writers and the majority of the publishers voted to accept the proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.776" offset="6602480">There was, however, a very substantial minority vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.280" offset="6620453">40% of the voting publishers voted no, 30% of the voting writers voted no, indeed of the eligible publishers only 47% voted yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.988" offset="6791293">Let me make, however, three observations on the argument that this plebiscite is enough to demonstrate that the directors of the Society were representing appellants' interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.301" offset="6848554">First, I would like to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.080" offset="6859734">Now, I think this is very important that the ballot -- the balloting was subject to the fatal deficiency that all of the facts were not available on which to exercise a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.986" offset="6911352">Because these appellants had not permitted to intervene, they had been unable to make a record on which a meaningful vote would have been really possible because they were not parties, they were unable to call witnesses, they were unable to attend their documentary evidence, and even more important, they were unable to lay before the Court evidence which has parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.153" offset="7008005">They could have elicited from the Society and from others by means of discovery and interrogations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.434" offset="7033083">They were not able to present the evidence which would have shown the value and the practicability of the alternatives which they were espousing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.058" offset="7071640">Well, it certainly is unusual, to say at least, to have a plebiscite on whether proposals to curve antitrust violators are adequate or inadequate particularly a proposal in which the violators and the victims both participated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.867" offset="7134856">Now, we think it would really be a monstrous doctrine to say that it should be given the conclusive effect that counsel here suggests for it, unless the people who were voting had the opportunity to know all the facts about all the issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.139" offset="7339969">And I suppose that it can be said that there is no necessary correlation between whether you want these proposals and whether your interests were adequately represented at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.508" offset="7385422">I think that is a valid comment which should -- could be made on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.515" offset="7401409">My point here is though that even accepting that premise, the basis upon which the voting was taken was inadequate basis to really record a definitive expression of the membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.825" offset="7502660">Well, that is what I'm suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.075" offset="7511646">They did not have because we have not been able to have the opportunity to present that to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.322" offset="7536619">Now, the other aspect of this which I think is important is that the voting was on a take it or leave it basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.868" offset="7566817">Appellants' papers, petition for intervention did not suggest that all provisions of the proposed amendments were bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.290" offset="7608508">There were provisions in the proposals which might well have commended themselves to members as a distinct improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.797" offset="7642572">No one can know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.153" offset="7648005">In other words, how many members voted yes on the premise that even a little bit of improvement is better than conditions which have become empowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.589" offset="7685726">Moreover, there is one other aspect of this take it or leave it which I think is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.993" offset="7707355">Due to what I am quite sure was a misapprehension by the District Court of his powers under the 1950 decree, the District Judge stated during the hearing on several occasions that the alternatives to an approval of these proposals was a litigation of the 1941 complaint which would put the entire Society in jeopardy of it's dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.470" offset="7817279">Needless to say, the directors and officers of the Society in campaigning for an affirmative vote in favor of their proposals made good use of the judges' remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.511" offset="7869419">My third comment on this plebiscite is that there was in fact a very substantial minority vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.317" offset="7912678">The appellants, the proposed intervenors don't stand before you as three descendants in a society of 5000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.780" offset="7946533">There were a very substantial number, presumably those who had no part in the negotiation of this decree who would rather have suffered on under the conditions existing, and they were taken this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.178" offset="8008077">Now, let me turn to the other half of this first requirement of the rule, the representation by the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.522" offset="8037439">Obviously here, the factors are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.910" offset="8051022">I think I can dispose some of them rather quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.217" offset="8064188">There is no dispute, of course, here that the Department of Justice by law and by tradition represents the interests -- the public interests in United States litigation whether it be antitrust or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.003" offset="8123434">The dispute on that issue rather is with the conclusion which the appellees seek to draw from it, and that is that Rule 24 (a) (2) simply has no application in government litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.468" offset="8177246">I think that that is a misinterpretation of the decisions of this Court and of the lower courts, and I think the true issue here is when such intervention is (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="2103.686" offset="8518092">The simple answer to most of those people is that they can't meet the formal requirement -- the less formal requirement of Rule 24 (a) (2) that they both will or maybe bound by the provisions of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.589" offset="8569710">The present case is really an unusual situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.838" offset="9934764">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.498" offset="9945318">Well, the -- the Department of Justice, to come back to the -- the point that I was on with Justice -- Mr. Justice Whittaker, takes the position in the brief -- in its briefs here, and I don't think I paraphrased this unfairly, that when that it is no business of the District Court to determine whether a consent decree adequately carries out the purposes of the antitrust laws or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.283" offset="10048554">The Department says that's its business, and it is no concern of the District Court, and it is not proper for the District Court to intervene in those determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.377" offset="10084916">Therefore, it says, "There is no warrant for intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.182" offset="10104142">There is no need to have further facts because there's nothing for the Court to decide."</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.775" offset="10126503">Now, I suggest that that is a rather startling contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.231" offset="10148342">I also suggest that it is pretty clearly contrary to what this Court said not more than a couple of months ago in System Federation against Wright, System Federation Number 91 against Wright where the Court had occasion to examine the question of the duty of the District Court on consent decrees and specifically on modification of consent decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.840" offset="10250742">For present purposes, the significant part of that decision is that in which this Court made it clear that the authority of the District Courts to approve a consent decree comes not at all from the agreement of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.326" offset="10320645">It may infrequently does approve the decrees but the authority comes from it and the responsibility is measured by the statute which the decree is entitled -- is intended to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.977" offset="10379264">Now, that to me means that the District Court does have a responsibility which it was obliged to discharge in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.991" offset="10415313">That responsibility, moreover, was measured by the antitrust laws, not by the agreement reached between the Department of Justice and the directors of the Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.470" offset="10461288">And in this case, the allegations of the appellants showed that the proposed decree felt so far short of adequate relief that it demonstrated that the Department of Justice did not adequately represented the interests of these appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.474" offset="10541223">Now, in our pleadings and in our supporting memorandum in the District Court, we specified the -- the matters in which the decree in our judgment were inadequate to accomplish the antitrust purposes of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.607" offset="10605798">In our brief in this Court, we have discussed two of those matters at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.336" offset="10632756">They aren't unfortunately simple, and they are very difficult to summarize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.243" offset="10652296">But let me illustrate, and I think this will be a fair illustration with the voting provisions, Section 4 of the proposed order, which is at 674 of the record, deals with the voting right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.997" offset="10715408">The Court will recall that I've stated earlier that under the 1950 decree, the directors had established a system of weighted voting under which the publisher that received the most money got the most votes, and the more money he could get for himself, the more he would be able to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.554" offset="10781550">The more the Society's revenues at these largest publishers were able to choral, the better they could solidify their control of the Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.951" offset="10819166">And at the time of the modifications proposed in 1959, the dominant publisher group, the group whose activities it was the purpose of the suit occur, had achieved for themselves about 63% of the weighted publisher vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.207" offset="10896175">Less than 1% of the entire publisher membership of the Society elected all the directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.063" offset="10923656">And as the Department of Justice itself said, this frustrated one of the antitrust purposes of the suit, the purpose to prevent the dominant publishers from using the Society to obtain an unfair competitive advantage over their other members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.579" offset="10993664">Now, faced with this situation of admitted control and this situation of admitted frustration of the antitrust purposes of the suit, what does the proposed modification do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.994" offset="11051342">By a series of provisions that permits this group, a dominant publisher group, to maintain 37% of the total publisher weighted vote, calculated on the basis of the figures then available as supplied by the directors of ASCAP, it permits in another provision that percentage to go up by 10% to 41% if the publishers properly adjust the affairs of their affiliates or if they can choral that much more of the Society's revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.664" offset="11190000">It ignores the fact which the appellants offered to prove in their papers that affiliated or allied with this dominant publisher group are the two largest publishers of series of music which adds a couple of additional percentage points to the total percentage of the weighted vote which the dominant group is able to muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.397" offset="11284982">And it further ignores the fact, as we also offered to prove, that you never get 100% voting by the publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.780" offset="11322493">Indeed, we had concluded in our offers of proof that the decree would actually give the dominant group approximately would leave the dominant group which it was the purpose of the suit to -- to occur approximately half of the usual publisher vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.389" offset="11392920">And it doesn't require very much argument to demonstrate that even if they had only 41% or even only 37% with the other votes widely scattered among 1300 small publishers, their control was not very seriously affected by the proposed decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.274" offset="11476511">In summary, the Department of Justice urged the District Court to accept the proposal which is no more significant in practical effect than if they urged that the percentage of the vote be reduced from 63% to 53%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.145" offset="11543907">And I submit that when the Department clearly leaves the appellants and the ASCAP's general membership at the mercy of the dominant group, as they do by this proposal, then the Department is not adequately representing the appellants' interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.518" offset="11617468">Now, the Department says, "Perhaps, this isn't very important because other provisions of the proposed decree prevent the directors from really doing much."</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.722" offset="11674311">We really pretty well curved their power even though they still may be in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.703" offset="11698134">I suggest that the -- that the figure with which the dominant group has fought for the control which it has suggest that there is more to the matter of controlling the affairs of ASCAP and perhaps the Department is willing to acknowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.699" offset="11762186">But let me illustrate by one other area of the decree, a portion of the decree which illustrates what the directors can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.855" offset="11806804">This is the area called the survey of performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.896" offset="11826970">Under the 1950 judgment, the directors are required to make a survey of performances and based the distribution of the -- of the revenues on that survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.416" offset="11873050">This information -- the survey consists of two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.428" offset="11893112">First, the collection of the information as to what is performed and then the application to a certain mathematical formula and -- to come out to a proper result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.297" offset="11944521">The memorandum submitted by the Department of Justice to the court below was properly very critical of the manner in which this survey had been conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.188" offset="11980152">The proposed order, however, does know more or little more than adjust the mathematical formula and the -- the calculations in order to bring the more in line with current random sampling field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.499" offset="12041383">It doesn't do anything to curve the judgment and the power of the dominant group who control the Board of Directors to affect the information as to performances which are fed in to these mathematical surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.015" offset="12099480">Let me give you a -- a quick illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.057" offset="12111600">The survey contemplates that a team will go out and take a tape recording of two hours of music on a local radio station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.374" offset="12156844">This tape was then mailed to New York where the ASCAP staff tries to figure out from all the hundreds of thousands of pieces of music that there are, who wrote and who published, not just the themes that are in there, but the background music, the theme music, the bridge music and cue music and all the other kinds of music that are involved in those two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.426" offset="12241063">There are innumerable questions of judgment that are involved in determining what kind of music it was, how it was used and how long it was played and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.398" offset="12280978">All these questions are left to a staff responsible to the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.594" offset="12305742">And this proposed decree does nothing to curve the power of the Board to control the activities and to affect the judgments of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.481" offset="12345344">We proposed to show that the only way you could avoid this obvious conflict of interest situation which now exists is to have this survey made by an outside organization, and we offer to prove that it could be probably be done for less than ASCAP itself was paying to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.954" offset="12419218">Now, I think my time is rushing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.917" offset="12439071">I hope that I have touched enough on the third part of the rule, the requirement that we must be bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.836" offset="12470732">I believe it is fair to say, in a very quick summary, that this is a class suit that in a class suit, res judicata applies to the members of the class and that an examination of this judgment will reveal to you that there are many aspects of it where it is not permissive, where it is mandatory that ASCAP performed in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.197" offset="12564146">And as to those places, it is, I think without question, binding upon us, as appellants, unable to be relitigated in any other suit and consequently sufficient to comply with the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.023" offset="12615450">I would prefer to reserve the remainder of my time if I may, sir.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="3139.042" offset="12659545">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.850" offset="12674800">I want to make it very explicit at the outset that the Government is not contending, as it has been suggested, that merely because a consent judgment is entered into between the Government and the defendant in an antitrust case that automatically that requires approval of that decree and entry by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.008" offset="12763408">The District Court in this case at the every outset was quite explicit in stating several times that Judge Ryan stated he would not approve this decree unless he was satisfied that it would carry out the antitrust purposes of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.341" offset="12828714">And at the very end of the opinion with little -- a little opinion with Judge Ryan rendered an oral opinion summarizing the decree and indicating why he approved it at page 666 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.305" offset="12876570">He said that although the decree is not a panacea for all the alleged evils besetting the Society, the decree does represent definite improvement over existing procedures, and that it will serve to advance the antitrust purposes of the government suit and of the prior decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.964" offset="12951280">In other words, Judge Ryan did not approve this decree unless and until he was satisfied that it was a significant step in improving the situation carrying out the antitrust purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.111" offset="12999868">Now, before Judge Ryan reached that conclusion, he had the benefit of two days of hearings in which he permitted all of the people who wish to speak in opposition or in favor of the decree to be heard including these very appellants' counsel heard at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.871" offset="13070817">Most of the people opposed the decree significantly at least two opposite, not on the ground that it didn't do enough, but it went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.892" offset="13102895">It was taken too much away from the existing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.139" offset="13115956">In addition to that, before the membership voted on this decree, they had the benefit of two series of meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.716" offset="13146258">A meeting was first held in New York and in -- on the West Coast of all the ASCAP members at which the decree was explained to them before the hearing in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.452" offset="13185128">Following that meeting and after the hearing when the judge directed that it be again submitted to the membership, further meetings were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.818" offset="13214595">At each of these meetings, counsel for ASCAP explained the decree, summarized the objections to it and stated the reasons why ASCAP believed it was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.165" offset="13256077">And if --</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.996" offset="13903391">That is our first proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.817" offset="13910601">And then we have a second proposition that in any event, on basis of the allegations that these appellants made from the basis of which they predicated their claim, that the Government was not adequately representing their interest that does not establish the ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.311" offset="13980609">Now, I think it may be helpful to the Court if I might just briefly indicate a few more of the fact as to how ASCAP operates.ASCAP has roughly 6400 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.715" offset="14030242">It grants licenses for the none -- for the public performance for profit, the playing of musical compositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.546" offset="14065560">These licenses charge for a fixed sum, for a stated amount, the right to use all the music in the ASCAP catalogue, perhaps a ballroom, a radio station may pay $10,000 to ASCAP to use all its catalogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.404" offset="14125014">And ASCAP received last year better than $30 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.053" offset="14143613">Now, under ASCAP's organization, after the expenses are paid, half of this money is distributed to the publishers, the other half is distributed to the writers, the authors and the composers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.751" offset="14190425">And the problem that arise is, of course, is how do you distribute this among all of these members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.165" offset="14212054">On what basis do you give one member more than another?</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.013" offset="14227414">Now, we know that different songs are played but we don't know exactly, specifically which song is played, where and how often.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.014" offset="14267434">So, what ASCAP has been doing, has been conducting a survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.086" offset="14287705">This is the survey that Mr. Horsky has mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.415" offset="14297004">They have conducted a survey in which they attempt to ascertain just how many of these songs are played and it's done on a sampling basis because you couldn't hear every particular composition that was played.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.868" offset="14346846">And if you could, the expense of such a hearing will be such, they would be no money left over by the time they got ready to distribute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.773" offset="14382477">Now, there's one other problem that arises in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.747" offset="14402330">There are two different types of used music basically, one is the so-called feature performance where song is sung, is played by an orchestra.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.501" offset="14433364">The other is the so-called background use of music, that is, as a theme song for a program on radio, on -- or television, a musical jingle, "Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot", that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.572" offset="14485608">Now, there are so-called recognized works in the musical field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.447" offset="14513194">For example, if on a television program, Easter Parade is heard in the background, this, to the average viewer, connotes the idea that the scene is being set for Easter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.101" offset="14559796">If the Lullaby of Broadway is played, you expect to see a scene of Broadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.477" offset="14577246">On the other hand, there's a lot of music that maybe very pleasant that serves the purpose but connote -- connotes no particular image to the listener.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.219" offset="14612250">Now, the result is that ASCAP feels, and I think quite justifiably, that the recognized works, the works which connote an image to the viewer, these are entitled to something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.802" offset="14658539">There are more valuable music.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.629" offset="14665853">And as more valuable music, certain greater recognition should be given to the playing of that kind of music as background music, then is given to the playing of music that connotes no image to the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.227" offset="14716322">Now, I want to make it clear, these are only in the case of the background uses of music.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.496" offset="14733354">This is not the case of a song that is given a feature performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.596" offset="14753729">Now, with this by way of background, let me turn to the precise claim for intervention that was made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.063" offset="14791659">The appellants do not claim that the decree, as far as it goes, isn't a good decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.566" offset="14817677">On the contrary, they concede that the decree has made improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.726" offset="14834291">That claim is basically that the decree doesn't go far enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.291" offset="14852577">And the claim is that the decree doesn't go far enough in certain specific areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.394" offset="14872952">There's no objection made to other areas in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.265" offset="14884446">Indeed, I think it's highly significant that there is no objection taken to the aspect of the decree which the District Court described as the most significant change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.475" offset="14929272">Of course, this question of the power of the directors, which I will come to in a minute, all turns in the last analysis as to how the money of ASCAP is to be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.640" offset="14965948">That's the basic concern, who is going to get what?</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.253" offset="14980368">And the District Judge described as the most significant change, the change that had been made in the distribution of the revenues of ASCAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.071" offset="15019656">There are also other areas in which the Government had concluded that the decree was deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.510" offset="15041390">And as to those areas, there is no attack made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.490" offset="15057377">So what we think we come down to hear is a claim that the Government has inadequately represented the public interest in negotiating this decree because in certain areas, the relief for which the Government was willing to settle the case rather than going to litigation is less than what appellants believe was called for by the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3828.582" offset="15417657">But if his claim is only that we have failed adequately to represent his interest, then I suggest that under sale principles, that is clearly does not entitled to intervene because I think he claims that the represent -- if he claims that the representation of his interest by the Government is inadequate, the answer to that is basically the Government is representing the whole of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.375" offset="15516923">And a private litigant, we don't think, can come in to a government suit in effect on the side of the Government merely because he claims that in conducting its litigation, the impact of what the Government is doing has an adverse effect on him.</text>

            <text syncTime="4732.390" offset="19032900">There was, in effect, every argument that appellant -- that the appellants are here making was fully canvassed in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.504" offset="19065396">Now, I would now to turn basically, briefly to the grounds upon which the appellants sought to intervene the theory on which they claim that the representation of their interest by the Government here was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.178" offset="19132061">I've mentioned earlier the problem of distribution of the revenues, how the money is to be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.664" offset="19174066">Previous to the 1960 decree, ASCAP had filed a very cumbersome system, a very involved system of distributing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.112" offset="19207816">I'll try to make it as brief as possible, what amounted to was -- and take, for example, the case of the writer or the publisher, after it had received the total amount to be given out to all the members of the group, it then divided into a number of funds, 20% went to one fund, 30% went to another fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.379" offset="19288900">And within each of these funds, there was a different basis of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.796" offset="19306559">And these funds were weighted so that the people who had been members of ASCAP for a longer period with greater seniority and the -- and who had more claims of their compositions tended to get a greater percentage of the takedown of the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.493" offset="19377298">Now, in this case of the writers, for example, only 20% of the total distributed to the writers was given on the basis of the current performances of these songs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.166" offset="19420035">Other portions were given on the length of membership, the length of time, that certain classical songs have been played and so.In the case of the publisher, it was a little bit larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.468" offset="19457233">Now, this was the Government considered one of them major defect of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.508" offset="19477400">The 1950 decree had directed that ASCAP distribute its revenues so as to get primary weight to the performances of the songs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.235" offset="19512299">And the Government was at a view that this judgment failed to do that, the old judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.365" offset="19528808">Now, a very significant and basic change was made in the scheme of distribution under the 1960 judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.282" offset="19560469">The change was that for the first time, the writers and the publishers were given the option of either following an old fund system but with modifications to correct some of these deficiencies or at their choice, they could now get all of their share on the basis of their current performances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.742" offset="19634343">This means that a new writer, one who is not old and established, was got some hints, and he's generating a lot of money can on -- for the first time, get compensation on the basis of the current performances of his song.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.523" offset="19689514">Now, we think this is a very significant thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.795" offset="19702575">Now, in addition to that, in addition to that, the various funds' themselves, the composition of them which changed and it-- furthermore, previously ASCAP had had the power to make great discrepancies in the amount of credit given to the same song used for background purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.015" offset="19795466">For example, sometimes as many as a thousand times, more credit was given to the playing of one song as a theme than another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.261" offset="19828381">That is all have been cut down on the basis on which they can give less than full credit to non-feature uses of this performance has been specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.146" offset="19871953">Now, I would like to turn to the matter which is the principal object of complaint of the appellants here which is the system of voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.954" offset="19919182">Under the old system of voting, voting was based upon the amount of income that a member got from ASCAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.649" offset="19950007">Each writer was given one vote for each $20 of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.694" offset="19966098">Each publisher was given one vote for each $500 of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.739" offset="19982294">That has been changed by the new decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.073" offset="19991698">The new decree, the voting system is based not on the income that this man received, which inevitability would tend to favor those who had been longest in the Society and the biggest people, but on the basis of the performances of their music.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.518" offset="20053452">And this, we think, is a very significant change, a change -- substantial change for the better.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.772" offset="20078425">Now, in addition, although the appellants attempt to minimize it, the percentage of control of the top 10 publishers, the share which they have was reduced from 63% to 37%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.871" offset="20138820">This was done by a system of graduated voting that the more votes you get -- the more performances you get, I'm sorry, the more votes when -- the more performances are needed for each vote, so that as you get bigger, it takes more performances to get a vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="6042.362" offset="24272854">That was what the Judge conceived to be before him.</text>

            <text syncTime="6390.020" offset="25663404">And it looks as though the presentation of the pleading of intervention establishes intervention without first requiring the proposed intervenor to adduce evidence of inadequacy of representation or of these other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6407.797" offset="25734562">So that once the petition to intervenors presented, it must be passed on.</text>

            <text syncTime="6448.557" offset="25897566">I think the Court could be confident that an experienced judge hearing this and other criticisms in a full and open hearing, if he had a court that wait to them, if he had thought, as Your Honor put the question, "Can I, in my judicial mind, demerge to this and still feel that I am right, then I will sign the decree, otherwise not."</text>

            <text syncTime="6497.423" offset="26093066">We have its narrative to suggest that the appeal should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6503.929" offset="26119084">This is an appeal under Section 2 of the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6508.229" offset="26136325">That Act suffers appeals only from the final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.605" offset="26161821">It is intended to cut out interlocutory appeals no matter how significant or momentous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6523.627" offset="26197870">And we submit that the decisions in this Court particularly the Allen Calculators case in 322 U.S. 137 and California Canaries require that the appeal be dismissed because it is not an appeal from the final judgment and is deliberately not such an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6547.911" offset="26295045">Now, we do not deny that appealable subject matter is present when intervention as a right is denied or conceivably, when an abuse of discretion is exerted in denying intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.093" offset="26367770">We think that the expression was in this Court in such a case as the Sutphen case indicating that appeal lies as a right relate to appealable subject matter and not the mode or occasion of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.679" offset="26430046">In the Sutphen case, the appeal was from the final judgment.</text>
