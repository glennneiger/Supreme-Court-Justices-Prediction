            <text syncTime="8.807" offset="138637">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.633" offset="149922">Appellants, we submit, have not met the second requirement of Rule 24 (a) (2) by showing that they are or may be bound by the judgment in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.230" offset="192240">We join the Solicitor General's argument to this effect made at pages 56 to 61 of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.278" offset="220453">Now, appellants' hint, at page 12 of their reply brief, that both appellant Pleasant Music and the Society have acknowledged in the pleadings in the state court case between them that both are bound by the 1950 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.228" offset="276250">They mistake the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.179" offset="284087">It is only that since 1950, the Society has incorporated in each agreement with each member a stamp legend stating that the grant of the owner's performing rights to the Society in the agreement is modified and set by and subject to the provisions of the 1941 and 1950 decrees and this corresponding provisions of the Society's articles and Board resolutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.706" offset="390248">Now, that allegation in the Society admitted for the stamp simply conform the new contract forms to limit the Society's acquisitions of copyright right -- rights in conformity with the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.086" offset="443747">Now, appellants, we submit, are not bound by the decree for several, clear and familiar reasons, first, whether or not the 1941 complaint was a representative complaint against the membership as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.737" offset="502366">The 1941 judgment ran only against the Society and extended as, of course, to directors, officers, employees, members and all persons acting on the Society's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.891" offset="562970">The 1950 decree applies only to the Society and officers, directors and employees and all other persons, including members, acting under, through or for the Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.366" offset="624828">The 1960 decree leaves that provision unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.726" offset="642278">Thus, appellants are neither parties to the decrees nor members of a class represented by parties against whom the decree runs representatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.077" offset="683656">Second, all three decrees were made without taking any testimony and all are expressly without any findings of fact or admission of or adjudication of violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.833" offset="746663">The decrees, thus, have no adjudicative content that could bind the right or interest of a non-party.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.796" offset="782608">Third, there are no issues in the case as between appellants and the other members of the Society or the Society as a whole, but only the consent decree disposition --</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_a_horsky" startTime="777.749" stopTime="1093.101">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="777.749" offset="3214399">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.300" offset="3228609">The course of the argument yesterday leads me to seek the indulgence of the Court on about three small points.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.307" offset="3268629">First, the Court will recall that in illustrating our contention, that the Department of Justice inadequately represented the interests of these appellants in presenting to the District Court of the decree which it proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.577" offset="3337697">I illustrated by assertion that the proposed decree left the voting control of the Society precisely where it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.648" offset="3389942">I hope that the Court will also have observed that neither Mr. Dooling nor Mr. Friedman took issue with that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.572" offset="3425677">I think it is fair to say that there is at least a passive acceptance of the proposition that under the proposed decree, the dominant members of this Society, which is -- it has been the purpose of this antitrust suit to curve and which it has been unsuccessful in doing in two antitrust decrees, remains undisturbed under the proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.981" offset="3535287">That antitrust purpose of the suit has not and will not be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.799" offset="3554617">Second, if I may turn from what Mr. Dooling and Mr. Friedman did not say to what they did say, I would like to elaborate a bit on one matter which I think I replied to Mr. Justice Whittaker about yesterday and that is what would have happened had we intervened in the court below -- had we been permitted to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.373" offset="3636851">As I see it, the situation would have been this.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.265" offset="3648449">The District Court, under the powers reserved to it in the decree, particularly in Article 17, which gives it a specific power, would have held a hearing on the proposed modifications of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.822" offset="3710621">The hearing would have been precisely the kind that was sanctioned by this Court in the Hughes case in the 342 United States and in the Liquid Carbonic case in the 350 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.751" offset="3766418">I find nothing in those cases or indeed, in any other cases to support the suggestion which Mr. Dooling made yesterday that in that hearing, the Court would have had to concern itself with the question whether the Society or its members had violated the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.936" offset="3851160">It wuld have been a hearing on whether and the extent to which further relief was appropriate and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.426" offset="3885119">And let me add that I see no reason why, following that hearing, it would have had any effect upon the future use of this decree in any Section 5 application in any later case.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.685" offset="3942066">It -- modified or not by the judge as the hearing might have indicated to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.430" offset="3969128">The decree still would not adjudge that anyone had violated the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.179" offset="3988041">I also should add that I think, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I believe, suggested yesterday, I don't really think that that issue is particularly relevant to the issue before you here on this appeal, but I believe that would be the course of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.386" offset="4048959">Now, in -- finally, and my third point, let me say only this.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.759" offset="4066408">I feel really a certain sympathy with the Department of Justice negotiators and counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.494" offset="4093367">ASCAP is a very complex organization, a very complex machine, and the way in which it can be made to work its will for the people who hold the reins of power in ASCAP are by no mens apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.527" offset="4161494">Indeed, it seems to me that in this kind of a case, where the issue is the regulation of the internal affairs of a complex society, it is highly appropriate that members of the Society who know its workings and who have been in it would be present to help the Court with their facts and their evidence to assist it in determining whether the decree before it did, in fact, adequately carry out the purposes of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.617" offset="4277791">One of these appellants, the Fox Company, has been a member of the Society for almost 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.453" offset="4301197">It's a charter member of the Serious Music Publishers in the Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.161" offset="4320005">The other two members of the -- of the appellants group have been members for approximately 20 years in the Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.369" offset="4352815">Those people know its workings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.933" offset="4363055">They have been in it, and their information, their advice and most important, their information as to what further evidence was available which could be presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.600" offset="4409762">It seems to me, it would have been inestimable assistance to the District Court in determining whether this decree did, in fact, properly carry out the purposes of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.089" offset="4451767">I submit to you that they should have been welcomed as intervenors rather than summarily rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.747" offset="4550405">This was a suit brought against ASCAP, its officers, directors and members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.270" offset="4580498">The consent decree which was entered -- it -- it tracks the language of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.130" offset="4599933">It was obviously intended to be and was indeed a true class suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.827" offset="4622712">The consent decree entered in 1941 had specific prohibition which ran against the members which, as a contemporaneous interpretation, perhaps is significant as to the nature of the suit.</text>
