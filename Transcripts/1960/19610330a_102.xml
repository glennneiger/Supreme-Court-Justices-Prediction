            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Lesser</label>
            <text syncTime="28.469" offset="217213">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please it the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.300" offset="236544">This matter is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.419" offset="265070">Notwithstanding the provisions of Article II of an 1881 convention for facilitating and developing commercial relations between the United States and Serbia, which the court below recognized as being in effect between the United States and Yugoslavia, the court below declared a decree to intestate estates as (Inaudible) on the ground that the decedents' next of kin, the petitioners here, being citizens and residents of Yugoslavia were not entitled to inherit under Section 1 (b) of Oregon's reciprocity statute so called, for the reason that the court found, and erroneously we would suggest, that remittances to the United States of the distributive shares of American beneficiaries of Yugoslavia States was subject to the foreign exchange controls that Yugoslavia maintains under the International Monetary Fund Agreement to which the United States and Yugoslavia and some 66 other nations are parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.883" offset="626918">Now, Article II of the 1881 convention, reciprocally grants to citizens of each country, most favored nation rights to acquire, to possess and to dispose of real and personal property, situated in the other country and specifically to acquire and dispose of such of property whether by purchase, sale, testament, inheritance or in any other manner whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.800" offset="770591">Now in consequence of an 1853 Treaty between the United States and the Argentine and a 1923 Treaty between Yugoslavia and Poland, these most favored nation rights have become national rights, that is that the citizens of each country are entitled in these respects to the rights of the citizens of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.320" offset="888665">Now, the court below recognized that if the petitioners were entitled to the rights granted by Article II of the Convention, the Oregon reciprocity statute under which they were held, disqualified to inherit would be inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.725" offset="970271">However, the court below construed Article II of the Convention as granting rights only to Yugoslavs who are within the United States and by necessary implication only to Americans who are in Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.325" offset="1052714">Now, so far as concerns, the specific language of the convention, we think that the Secretary of State in construing this provision, put it succinctly when he said that the question is whether the words, in Serbia and in the United States as used in the convention, are to be treated as adjectival, that is as modifying citizens of the United States and Serbian subjects respectively or whether they are to be treated as advertent, that is as modifying (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="278.167" offset="1216031">Now on the face of it, the language of the convention is --</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="283.347" offset="1236720">Is that -- is that in Article II?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Lesser</label>
            <text syncTime="285.201" offset="1244139">That's Article II, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.848" offset="1254797">Now on the face it, the language of the convention is susceptible to the interpretation that the court below put upon it, but only on the face of it and only if the convention's express purpose of facilitating and developing commercial relations between the two countries is completely disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.261" offset="1352391">The inescapable consequence of the interpretation of the court below would be to defeat every objective of the Treaty, necessary to the achievement of its ultimate purpose and to defeat that purpose itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.477" offset="1417279">For example, under the construction of the court below, if a merchant in one country wanted to buy or sell goods in the other, he would have no treaty right to acquire, to possess or to dispose of such goods or indeed of the money and credits that would be involved in such a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.588" offset="1521768">Nor if such a merchant engaged in a transaction of that kind, would he have any treaty guarantee that in the event of his death, the funds and credits and goods that he accumulated in the other country, would descend to his next of kin, who remained at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.729" offset="1618317">Furthermore, merchants in one country would have no treaty right to the -- to access to the courts of the other, in the event of dispute, nor would there be any treaty protection, whatsoever, against discriminatory practices in relation to the taxation, customs or any other of the multitude of matters affecting trade and commerce and with respect to which the convention purports to think.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.735" offset="1738271">And what's more, the goods and credits of the merchants of one country that were in the other would not be exempted from forced loans or military exactions or requisitions as the convention provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.026" offset="1803473">Now, when -- bear in mind that commerce between countries is and has been typically conducted by merchants (Inaudible), who stay at home themselves and do business abroad by mail and cable or by traveling salesmen or traveling buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.206" offset="1888214">The construction of the court below would leave the convention a slim read, if read at all, for facilitating the -- and developing commercial relations between the two countries, but the court below took no such considerations into account and it expressly refused to give any weight whatsoever, to the Secretary of State's carefully considered construction of the convention communicated to and concurred in by Yugoslavia that Article II grants to the citizens of each of country whatever they might be, the right to acquire by inheritance or otherwise, property located in the other and the right freely to possess and dispose of property located in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.027" offset="2115480">Nor did the court below give any weight whatsoever to what we consider the most compelling circumstance that the United States had fully relied on the convention so construed to protect all American property rights in Yugoslavia when it negotiated and concluded the Yugoslav Claims Settlement Agreement in 1948, that Yugoslavia had acquiesced in that construction and that the construction adopted by the court below would necessarily result in American property and American property rights in Yugoslavia being wholly without treaty protection except for such property and property rights as belonging to the few Americans that can be found in Yugoslavia.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.194" offset="3804139">Now the court below construed Article II as it did solely on the ground that the case was doubled, the first case was doubled.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.638" offset="3857951">The first construction was doubled by this Court's decision, in Clark against Allen, 331 U.S. 503 and we would suggest that the Court completely misread both Clark and the treaty provisions there involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.397" offset="3936946">In Clark, an American had bequeathed property located in the United States to a German and the question was what?</text>
            <text syncTime="968.486" offset="3977279">The 1923 Treaty with Germany protected the legatee against the consequences of California's so called reciprocity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.803" offset="4026598">The German Treaty provided nationals of either High Contracting Party, may have full power to dispose of their personal property of every kind within the territories of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.222" offset="4088247">And their heirs, legatees and donees of whatever nationality whether resident or non-resident, shall succeed to such personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.102" offset="4131819">Now following the line of cases, beginning with the 1860 decision in Frederickson against Louisiana, which dealt with the series of treaties having almost identical language with that of the German Treaty, this Court held in Clark that the -- that either High Contracting Party met one High Contracting Party and that the phrase, “Within the territories of the other,” modifies their personal property so that the -- such personal property which could be inherited was the personal property within the territory of one country belonging to a citizen of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.474" offset="4305272">Accordingly, this point held Clark that the German Treaty did not apply, because that was not a case where a citizen of one country had bequeathed property located in the other, but was a case where a citizen of one country had bequeathed property located in his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.255" offset="4384371">Now the difference between the German Treaty and Article II of the convention is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.964" offset="4415195">Under the German Treaty, the right of a legatee or other beneficiary to succeed depends upon the decedent being a citizen of one country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.243" offset="4464306">And the subject of the gift being property located in the other, the German Treaty expressly provides that the nationality and the residence of the legatee is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.512" offset="4525432">Now Article II of the convention however, covers both disposition and acquisition by any means whatsoever, of property in one country by citizens of the other, wholly without reference in the -- to a -- wholly without reference to the nationality or residence of the donee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.464" offset="4625220">In the case of disposition or the nationality or residence of the donor in the case of acquisition, the only question being whether this right of citizens of one country to acquire property located in the other by inheritance or otherwise and to possess and to dispose of property located in the other is limited to such of those citizens who themselves are within the territory of the other country within which the property is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.486" offset="4785298">Now, the court below read the German Treaty as though the phrase, “Within the territories of the other” modified nationals of either High Contracting Party rather than the phrase, “Their personal property of every kind” which is what this Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.669" offset="4870040">And it misunderstood Clark as holding and I quote, "That the German Treaty applied only to nationals of either of the party nations who were within the territory of the other."</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.672" offset="4934092">Now -- no such question arose in Clark, no point had arisen in Clark because the German Treaty specifically support that a donee's right to succeed is out -- is without regard to his nationality or residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.018" offset="5003473">Now, the decision in Clark did not hinge on the whereabouts of either the testator or the legatee, but rather on the nationality of the testator and the location of the property which was the subject of the gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.934" offset="5067107">Under the German Treaty, it was decisive that the decedent was an American and that the property was in the United States since the right of a donee to take ownership depends upon the donor, being a citizen of one country, and the property being located in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.006" offset="5155401">Now here, that the decedent was an American and that the property is in the United States is wholly immaterial because under the convention, the right of a donee to take depends upon his -- the donee's, being a citizen of one country and the property being within the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.837" offset="5254771">We think it's clear that Clark is without relevance here, either as a precedent or by way of analogy and that the court below was completely mistaken in relying upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.525" offset="5321435">We believe also that the construction of the court below must be rejected as entirely incompatible and inconsistent with the purpose of the convention and one which would make it wholly ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.880" offset="5386846">We think that the construction placed on the convention by the Executive, that's the Secretary of State, the negotiator and by the congressional committees is entitled to exceptionally great weight here, particularly since it was relied on in negotiating and implementing the agreement for the protection of American property rights in Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia acquiesced in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.097" offset="5487783">Now the convention is a two-way street and if the right of these petitioners to inherit this American property is not protected by it, then neither is any property right or any property in Yugoslavia of any American other than such Americans as native in Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.151" offset="5591960">We think that the construction placed on Article II by the court below is without authority in Clark or elsewhere and is contrary to the basic tenets for the construction of treaties announced time and time again by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.067" offset="5659669">We think that the construction for which we argue the construction of the Secretary of State and of the Congressional Committees, does make the standards, does give effect to the Treaty and is the only proper construction of the convention and that for that reason the decrees below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.872" offset="5770846">Now alternatively, the petitioners believe that the decrees below should be reversed because Section 1 (b) of the Oregon reciprocity statute so called, as construed by the court below and applied by it here is inconsistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund to which the United States and some 66 other nations are parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.183" offset="5892054">Article VI, Section 3 of the Agreement to which the United States became a party pursuant to the Bretton Woods Agreement Act, provides and I quote, “Members may exercise such controls as are necessary to regulate international capital movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.306" offset="5980557">Transfers of legacies from one country to another, as Oregon admits, are international capital movement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.182" offset="6024129">Accordingly, even if Yugoslavia subjects remittances of legacies abroad to its foreign exchange controls, which we suggest is not the case, but if it does, it does so as a matter of right under the fund agreement to which the United States is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.847" offset="6098735">And we think it's clear under the decisions of this Court that a state may not pursue a domestic policy which is in conflict with the federal policy and action within the competence of the Federal Government to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.451" offset="6157145">And by the fund agreement, the United States has agreed to the maintenance by Yugoslavia and the other fund members of controls on capital transfers abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.425" offset="6345122">Now, Oregon would thus put an onerous penalty on the exercise by a foreign government of a right which the United States has agreed it may exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.248" offset="6384410">If Oregon can do that, then each of the 50 states can take measures within the ambit of its domestic policy which would penalize or encumber the exercise by a foreign government of any right recognized or granted by the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.170" offset="6756080">The two questions here of course, are the interpretations of Article II of the Treaty and the effect of the International Monetary Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.062" offset="6791607">Now the Oregon Supreme Court in the exercise of its de novo ennoble powers in equity reversed the trial court and found on appeal that American heirs did not in fact, have a right to receive an -- an unqualified and legally enforceable right to receive payment of their inheritances from Yugoslavia by reason of Foreign Exchange Control Laws as well other evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.527" offset="6893484">So that was the factual question, but that leads to two legal questions of the Treaty and the monetary fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.841" offset="6922742">Now the language in the Treaty of course, reads in this manner, “In all their concerns, the right of acquiring, possessing or disposing of every kind of property, real or personal, citizens of the United States, in Serbia and Serbian subjects in the United States, shall enjoy the rights which respective laws grant”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.788" offset="7022529">Here the language is clear and plain, citizens of the United States and Serbia and Serbian Subjects if in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.123" offset="7055862">We submit that the language of the treaty must be read as it appears in the way in the way it was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.767" offset="7082402">Here it is clear that the words, in Serbia and in the United States modify the words, persons or citizens or subjects respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.808" offset="7130572">A similar language was used in the German Treaty which was a construed in Clark versus Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.902" offset="7158993">And in that case, it was held that an American citizen leaving property to a German national did not come within the terms of the Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.347" offset="7196714">So here, an American Citizen in the United States leaving property to foreign nationals would not be covered by the Yugoslavian Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.019" offset="7263483">In -- as a background to this case, the brief amicus curiae as well as the brief of the petitioners I believe, values certain document from material, diplomatic dispatches which were written by Casen and Schiller, who were the negotiators of the Romanian and Serbian Treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.495" offset="7341328">It corresponds with the Secretary of State at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.536" offset="7357524">I've not gone into it too thoroughly, that is I had only the copies of the -- the diplomatic dispatches that were given to me before the state copies which have been done -- filed down here with the clerk, but to the extent I did go into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.738" offset="7426278">It appears that the language used by the negotiators of the treaties Schiller and Casen is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.438" offset="7453132">It's admirable for its conciseness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.979" offset="7463267">So it leads to the conclusion that the language in the Serbian Treaty was not inadvertent language, but language that was carefully chosen to express a particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.982" offset="7503287">Again, this document with material points at the background to the situation at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.903" offset="7530977">It had not been too long that Serbia was free to the Turkish rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.132" offset="7547904">As I understand it at that time under the Treaty's rule, capitulations had been granted, which gave foreigners the same rights within the country, the Serbian country as they enjoyed the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.992" offset="7595342">And -- and again, I understand that these capitulations were not very popular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.868" offset="7614882">Again, it was the United States who was seeking the treaty with Serbia rather than the other converse situation that it's Serbia seeking the treaty with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.375" offset="7652916">So it may very well be that the fear of exploitation and took these steps to cut down and qualify the rights, which they were granting by this Treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.940" offset="7739120">Going on to the International Monetary Fund which the petitioners have argued here is an overriding federal policy, we find the not too much source of material which throws light upon the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.213" offset="7796276">The cases are very few.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.450" offset="7801187">The authorities are very few, which had interpreted the monetary fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.905" offset="7823026">One of the best sources, however, is the annual reports of the board and in them, it appears that the policy of the board is to discourage the maintenance of exchange restrictions, rather than to encourage them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.089" offset="7883734">They were the exchange restrictions, many of them were in effect before the -- the World War II and they have continued in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.666" offset="7922082">Originally under Monetary Fund Agreement, they were regarded as an emergency measure in the post war period so the countries would get back on their feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.573" offset="7961684">However, it has been the consistent policy of the fund to discourage foreign exchange controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.743" offset="7998360">As was mentioned here, inheritances appeared to be capital transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.678" offset="8018108">The Monetary Fund Agreement is concerned primarily with the current transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.154" offset="8056038">The fund report indicates that the control of transfers -- capital transfers are within the control of the member nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.248" offset="8092400">So although Yugoslavia has chosen to exercise and maintain fund controls, the United States has not adopted any policy one way or the other, whether or not, it will have the exchange controls or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.284" offset="8140466">We have not adopted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.403" offset="8149034">So the -- as far as the United States is concerned, this is a -- it has adopted no overriding federal policy which leaves the state statute free to operate as it was before the United States became a member of the fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.504" offset="9017344">There it is clearly evident that the Yugoslavian Government does impose restrictions of foreign capital transfers in Article VIII and this appears in the record of page 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.985" offset="9079306">In that article, the United -- the Yugoslavian Government used to give sympathetic consideration to applications for transfers to the United States.</text>
