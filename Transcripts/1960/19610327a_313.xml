            <text syncTime="24.204" offset="200182">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.368" offset="216795">The petitioner is here asking this Honorable Court to set aside a final judgment for the respondent, reverse the opinion of the Florida District Court of Appeals and reinstate the jury verdict for the petitioner in a Federal Employers' Liability Act case which he recovered after a several day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.959" offset="323166">The petitioner was a railroad employee, was given a so-called "field test".</text>
            <text syncTime="62.069" offset="351692">He was or suffered personal injuries, received a jury verdict which was taken away from him by the Florida Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.495" offset="401324">The issue to the petitioner seems to be whether or not the manner, method and motive in giving an alleged field test, which resulted in personal injury to the petitioner, states an issue under the Federal Employers' Liability Act or as a grievance under the Railway Labor Act which what -- is what the Florida Appellate Court determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.325" offset="500694">The Florida Appellate Court held and I quote, "That there was no justiciable issue at least under the Federal Employers' Liability Act that could be raised as to the propriety or the right of the railroad to give a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.330" offset="568717">And if the petitioner will agree, he had a remedy for such grievance under the Railway Labor Act, completely ignoring a fact, that the Railway Labor Act provides no remedy for personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.536" offset="629530">Petitioner contended in his complaint that the railroad was liable in the following respects, in negligently and unlawfully requiring the plaintiff to participate in such a field test and two, in negligently allowing the servants, agents or supervisors to conduct such a test which resulted in a personal injury to the railroad employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.304" offset="732557">The Florida court states in its opinion that there could be no issue under such allegation and made some statement about a reasonable safe place to work which we felt had no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.482" offset="793266">In 1956, Bert Smith, flagman on the Florida East Coast, weighed 262 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.628" offset="825866">This was lower than his average weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.258" offset="844361">His previous weight had been sometimes in the 300.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.097" offset="859721">He was 61 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.469" offset="869230">He was five foot and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.448" offset="881142">He was and is a legend on the Florida East Coast Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.366" offset="896815">He is a man who knew all the roads and had never received a demerit in 30 years -- 37 years of service as a bagger and a flagman.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.533" offset="969540">In September of 1956, a railroad supervisor asked Smith to retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.956" offset="1003186">He was on the train and get ready to go to Jacksonville.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.724" offset="1018232">Mr. Smith advised him that he had two or three more years of good service and he refused to retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.038" offset="1047489">He was then ordered to take an alleged physical fitness test.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.600" offset="1069746">This was the first term in the history of this railroad that anybody in his capacity had ever been requested or ordered to take this type of test.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.553" offset="1117602">The railroad had been in existence since 1896.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.409" offset="1141008">The railroad or the supervisors of the railroad admittedly the bias of test that it knew Smith, in his physical condition, could not pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.893" offset="1182908">It was a walking a mile down the tracks on a hot humid Florida day.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.745" offset="1206314">There had been very little change in Smith's physical conditions for a period of several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.133" offset="1231914">Short time before this incident occurred, he had been to the Flagler Hospital in St. Augustine, had been certified as being fit for his duties as flagman.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.437" offset="1285099">He and his representatives went to the -- my opposed for this test was sent out and they protested in right time at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.768" offset="1338493">One of their protestations was that this test had never been given before that heretofore the chief surgeon of the medical department had always been a person to arbitrate a man's physical fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.250" offset="1404322">Mr. Smith started the test, walking down the tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.080" offset="1419682">He was accompanied by four other men.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.617" offset="1433788">It was obviously he couldn't pass this particular test.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.843" offset="1450715">He failed three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.394" offset="1460955">As a result of the fall, he became totally and permanently disabled to work on the railroad and his ability to walk was greatly impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.132" offset="1495855">He'd had arthritis from 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.218" offset="1512260">And as a result of this fall, his arthritic condition in his knees was aggravated and there was no dispute that he was permanently and totally disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.593" offset="1557713">Evidence was induced at the trial with secured, jury could and indeed fully that the so-called test that this railroad and device had no relation to Smith's duties as a flagman.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.882" offset="1610898">And I'll wish to go into the evidence at this time because the jury decided in that particular issue but this particular area which he worked had a block system.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.820" offset="1658650">The medical department had always -- before this been an arbitrator of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.802" offset="1678608">The medical department just a few days before this had certified this man has able to handle this particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.155" offset="1716015">He had performed -- he had been performing his duties on supervision for years in the present physical condition and he had never been reprimanded or received any demerits.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.911" offset="1770977">We also contended at the trial and currently, the jury believed us that this was a test devised solely to get rid of Bert Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.933" offset="1811101">This was only time in the history of the railroad and it was not in conflict to any courts with any of the rules of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.272" offset="1848508">The Florida court in its original position or opinion precluded us from raising the issues and it confined it solely to, did they give him a reasonable safe place to conduct this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.633" offset="1905873">That just nullified the whole action as we saw it because they precluded us from establishing the manner in which the test was given, the method, the motive whether or not the test had any relation to his duties which the jury believe that he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.769" offset="1974418">In fact, there's a medical department heretofore and certified his fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.480" offset="1993331">In fact, that the medical department under testimony of a chief surgeon will we brought at the trial that he had testified that Bert Smith was qualified to perform the duties of a flagman, that this was also pointed out to these men in their original letter that they protested too when they started the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.192" offset="2084133">The fact that Bert Smith's physical condition prevented him from performing this test, this was something -- this was a test that it was obvious to anybody that Bert Smith would never pass this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.140" offset="2143901">He fell and of course a part from the arthritis became seriously injured and was rushed to a hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.040" offset="2307532">We feel, Mr. Justice Brennan, that this was all part of the negligent manner and method, the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.754" offset="2354343">Now, the Supreme Court of Florida did say that the reasonable safe place in which to work was the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.888" offset="2382973">We contend that that particular item was out of the case but the terrain of place they stay fit for him to perform his task went to the motive, went to the manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.723" offset="2438248">I think we could have gone back and possibly tried this case under -- whether too many rocks there.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.182" offset="2460087">But that was not the issue in this case and we felt not the major issue in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.730" offset="2486314">The petitioner has never contended but the railroad couldn't give proper and reasonable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.902" offset="2514944">We admitted that an induced evidence at the trial that the supervisors could relieve men at a time when he was unable to perform his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.771" offset="2554441">We stated at the trial and in our appellate procedure and showed that the supervisor had the authority that any time they felt that a man could not perform his duties, all they have to do was take him off the train and then have him certified either as being qualified or not qualified by the medical department.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.958" offset="2643153">But that this attempt to pick out a test that they knew he could not pass under conditions that he knew he could not pass, circumventing completely the medical department, was solely an attempt to get rid of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.660" offset="2706056">We admitted that the railroad should be concerned with safety but they not use -- should not use safety as a guidance to preclude a man from performing the job in the same manner that he performed it for years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.209" offset="7396185">The trouble with my good friend Bill Frates is that he had a perfectly good complaint with eight allegations of negligence and six of them covered this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.743" offset="7442369">He elected, however, to travel on the first two which then alleged negligence under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.198" offset="7472149">The Supreme Court of Florida called his attention to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.762" offset="7482389">They send him back and said, "Try your case under your allegations of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.902" offset="7502973">You haven't alleged any negligence under your first two counts."</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.082" offset="7515721">He goes back on the retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.658" offset="7521991">And on the retrial, he gets up on his hind legs and says, "I'm going to stick to my guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.877" offset="7542888">I abandoned all these allegations if the Court says constitute allegations of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.492" offset="7565354">And I'm going to be stubborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.595" offset="7569742">I'm going to be like an ostrich to stick my head in the sand, and I'm going to continue to insist on the two that are not even good and with that happened to it."</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.873" offset="7618853">You misread them, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.826" offset="7630660">You'll see at the record on page 1, he starts out by saying that in 1956, when he was employed as a trainman on the main line of the Florida East Coast, he was directed to have a field test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.018" offset="7675486">Now, there's certainly enough to negligence by fit, so far, particularly says he concedes that he is entitled to be given a reasonable field test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.050" offset="7707564">Then what's his first allegation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.677" offset="7718118">That on such and such a date, the defendant was negligent (a) in negligently and unlawfully requiring the plaintiff to participate in such a field test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.743" offset="7754376">Well, there's nothing wrong there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.148" offset="7759914">He doesn't say in an improper field test, in a negligent field test, in a wrongful field test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.158" offset="7788022">He just says the field test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.694" offset="7794186">And he himself has conceded that a reasonable and proper field test is alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.684" offset="7814144">So, that -- that's the reason they threw that one out because he didn't allege any negligence under (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.517" offset="7833475">I repeat again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.983" offset="7839326">If he had said that we gave him an improper field test, a negligent field test --</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.391" offset="7880913">In such -- well, he's got to say that we -- some allegation, there was something wrong with the test because he himself concede that we've got the right to give him a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.569" offset="7917693">So his allegation is he's got to say something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.972" offset="7927306">He does say further on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.745" offset="7934307">This isn't inadvertent pleading, getting further down that he does say what he needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.693" offset="7954160">Then in number B, he says in negligently allowing his servants, agents or supervisors to conduct such a field test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.638" offset="7981955">Now, he doesn't say that they negligently conducted the field test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.859" offset="8002853">He doesn't say they conducted an improper test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.454" offset="8013197">He just says that it was wrong to conduct the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.112" offset="8027826">And the Supreme Court of Florida says that since the only way you can sue under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, at least that's the way we understand it, is to allege negligence that there was no justiciable negligence allowing those two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.390" offset="8092923">The Court said that Mr. Frates misled the jury by prejudicial argument and got them off from side issues, and they reversed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.868" offset="8126882">It should go back and be tried on grounds (c) through (h) which specifically alleged negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.748" offset="8158333">Now, gentlemen, this is right in Court matter to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.596" offset="8173798">And I hope you don't get up on the side tracking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.272" offset="8184456">He's got six perfectly good driving of negligence.</text>
