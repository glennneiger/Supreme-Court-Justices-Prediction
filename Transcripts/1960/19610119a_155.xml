            <label>Mr. William D. Dexter</label>
            <text syncTime="21.229" offset="188270">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.235" offset="212302">The essential question here involves the validity of a Michigan statute imposed upon the shares of the appellant bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.230" offset="280325">It's a 5 1/2-mill tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.735" offset="294327">It is measured by the capital account of the appellant bank that represents 4% of the appellant bank's employable assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.523" offset="333511">The trial court in response to the same kind of argument that the appellant has presented here both by brief and by oral argument, decided that the restrictions imposed on the State of Michigan to tax national bank shares had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.846" offset="418774">The Supreme Court of Michigan, by a unanimous decision arrived at the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.091" offset="451688">Now, frankly, everything that the appellant has brought before this Court in argument has been answered thrice by the appellees both in the trial court, in the Supreme Court of Michigan and I believe quite comprehensively and adequately by the appellees' brief filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.946" offset="543117">I do believe, however, that it would be helpful to this Court to see the issue in this case put in a proper setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.581" offset="605706">I would then begin by informing the Court generally, of the tax picture in Michigan concerning the taxation of financial businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.845" offset="654712">Now, prior to 1952, the State of Michigan did not impose any tax on national bank stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.308" offset="700583">It did impose a 4-mill franchise privilege fee on banks and trust companies under the General Corporation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.196" offset="744155">This tax is measured by paid-up capital and surplus of each of these institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.306" offset="776547">This tax, the 4-mill tax on paid-up capital and surplus, the annual franchise privilege fee in Michigan imposed on all corporations, was also paid generally by financial corporations in the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.984" offset="855333">Also in 1952 and prior thereto, the general financial businesses in terms of their intangible properties were subject to a tax of 3.5% on the dividends paid or received by such corporations on their stock holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.747" offset="954389">Also, there was a tax of 1/25 of 1% on various intangible properties classified as accounts receivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.518" offset="1001409">In addition, under the General Intangibles Tax Act, there was imposed the tax of 40 cents per 1000 that the appellant refers to, on cash deposits in all banking and financial institutions and savings and loan share account moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.420" offset="1093047">In addition, in 1952 and prior thereto, the State of Michigan imposed on domestic savings and loan associations, a franchise fee measured by 1/4 mill of the pay -- of the savings share account and legal reserve moneys of each state institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.138" offset="1199940">Now, by a series of amendments in 1954, federal savings and loan associations were subjected to the same tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.627" offset="1241840">In addition, the financial businesses generally, were subject to some miscellaneous taxes to which appellant bank was not subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.540" offset="2749524">The only tax imposed on national banks in 1952 by the State of Michigan was the 5 1/2-mill tax imposed by an amendment of the general Intangibles Tax Law by Act 9 of the Michigan Public Acts of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.161" offset="2824025">This tax plus the tax on the real property of the bank constituted the sole tax burden to the State of Michigan, which incidentally represented about 8/10 -- 9/10th of a mill on the total employable assets of the appellant bank, but this was their total tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.162" offset="2912005">Now, as distinguished from that burden, the savings and loan associations pay a tax of 40 cents per 1000 on the share accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.292" offset="2968534">And also, depositors in banks paid a tax of 40 cents per 1000, but this tax was absorbed by the banks and generally is in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.018" offset="3023496">But in addition to the 40 cents per $1000 tax on Michigan savings and loan shares including the federal, the state savings and loans only in 1952 and both state and federal in 1954, paid a 1/4 of a mill franchise tax to the Secretary of State's office, measured by the total share account and the legal reserves of each institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.873" offset="3134882">Also, the savings and loan associations in Michigan were subject to a lot of miscellaneous taxes that the national banks could not be subjected to because of the restrictions imposed on a state's power by Section 5219.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.373" offset="3204890">This includes a personal property tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.214" offset="3296214">Yes, I would -- I would like to do that and I think that this can be accomplished by an examination of the competitive facts and circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.034" offset="3351489">Now, appellant bank's capital account, that is the subject of this 5 1/2-mill tax we're here concerned with, represented 4% of its employable assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.891" offset="3402898">In other words, it was $13,000,000 out of $306,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.269" offset="3424423">The balance of the appellant's employable assets made -- was made up of deposit money of $283,000,000 and these moneys, $283,000,000, $157,000,000 were demand deposits, the balance were time deposits of one kind or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.113" offset="3519822">Now, also in 1952, this equity capital, this capital that the appellant is talking about in reference to Section 5219 was able to command in the loan activity, a loan, approximately 12 times the assets of a dollar value of a savings and loan share account.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.077" offset="3619715">It was able to command in the financial field, $23 to $1 of the capital account.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.290" offset="3652524">It was able to produce in 1952 a net profit of 31.5% before federal income taxes on the total capital account of the appellant bank which translated into the original investment in the appellant bank by stock holders in 1941, amounted to several hundred percent return on the original capital investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.168" offset="3756074">This can be translated also into an analogy with the facts, all the savings and loan people.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.959" offset="3803199">The savings and loan people allegedly in competition with the business of national -- the appellant national bank in Michigan in 1952, had total share account moneys of $143,000,000, mutual moneys pooled by savers, which was less than the appellant's demand deposits on which it paid no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.894" offset="3906957">These share account moneys were able to use or able to produce only 3.3% return.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.604" offset="3945827">Now, we simply are essentially saying that the appellant bank with the broad powers given a national bank in association, with the ability to create checkbook money, with the exclusive ability to receive deposit moneys, is in a position economically to really employ equity capital and that a -- in a dollar investment in a share of national bank stock, is an entirely different thing than a so called investment in a savings and loan share account dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.719" offset="4118235">For this reason, the only expert testimony produced in this cause, Professor Woodward, of the University of Michigan, a professor of finance and taxation said that, "If you wanted to make a competitive that economic comparison of these two institutions in a realistic manner, you had to look to what each institution had to compete with, namely so many dollars."</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.795" offset="4250520">Essentially, we say then that the appellant bank equipped with these broad powers, could employ a -- on a ratio of 23 to 1 assets, in the residential mortgage market or any other activity it sought to engage in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.618" offset="4381863">Well, I -- I think that that question really interrelated and let me say why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.154" offset="4416031">Tax discrimination or rate discrimination as the appellant would phrase it, under Section 5219, is only the kind of discrimination by a state that can be said to discourage an investment in a national bank stock and to that end places the business of national banks at a competitive disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.080" offset="4527731">And we simply say as long as savings and loan share accounts, impossibly employed in competition in the residential mortgage market admittedly with the deposit money of the appellant bank are treated equally, there really isn't any discrimination in fact and none can be read into Section 5219.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.489" offset="4665344">The bank actually, in 1952, employed its deposit money and primarily its time deposit money under the Comptroller's regulations, in a residential mortgage market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.658" offset="4726053">And there primarily in a field guaranteed by the Federal Government so these assets could be considered liquid by the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.055" offset="4759594">On the other hand, the savings and loan share account money was employed in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.777" offset="4786448">Now, these have been taxed equally by the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.984" offset="4799300">Then if you step back and take the total asset -- the total asset comparison that we have used in our brief, you'll come up with equal taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.305" offset="4832632">If you took a gross income to gross income comparison, you come up with equivalent taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.863" offset="4858859">If you take the capitalization of earnings at the same rate of return, you come up with equal taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.651" offset="4893968">And we say, under these kinds of circumstances, there really isn't anything for the appellant to complain about within the purview of Section 5219.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.974" offset="5891218">So that we say that -- that the capital of the bank has not been established by this in this case factually, to have been in any competition with the savings and loan businesses, but rather that they have used a portion of their time deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.188" offset="5960077">But we've backed off from this and said, "Even though this is true, let's look at the total picture of the two institutions."</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.639" offset="6449925">And the first thing they had to decide was there any exception to this language?</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.101" offset="6487751">And the Court struggled for years in trying to determine what was meant by the phrase, other moneyed capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.583" offset="6521710">But the Court said that it was -- that this statute was not designed to rewrite the tax structures of the State, but as said in the Tradesmen’s case by this Court as late as 1940, it was designed to subject to tax in a practical way, economic equivalence and this is the conclusion that Professor Powell reached in regard to the Section 5219 cases in his law review article, much ado about gross receipts taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.586" offset="6685759">That simply -- yes, Section 5219 has been interpreted and if you took the fact that rate was the only thing that you looked at and then you looked at the species of what we might call other moneyed capital, you come out with a mechanical kind of interpretation and discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.038" offset="6771545">The difficulty with that argument in the instant case is that it would also bring within the purview of other moneyed capital, bank deposits which would end up with the absurd result of requiring a Michigan state bank to pay a tax of 11.5% or 125 mills on its capital account compared to a 5 1/2 mill tax on the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.703" offset="6894216">In other words, if other moneyed capital or moneyed capital within 5219 is so constructed to bring within its purview savings and loan share accounts, it has to bring within its purview United States Government bonds, it has to bring within its purview credit unions and a lot of other favored or differently treated species of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.391" offset="7008946">Now, we simply say that this Court in its wisdom recognized that a mechanical interpretation in the approach of Section 5219 was not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.196" offset="7060146">That you had to determine what Congress intended by this provision, what it was trying to protect and then interpret and apply this language in relationship to that intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.231" offset="7156276">In -- in following out this congressional purpose, the -- this Court long recognized that the states could exempt or they could preferentially treat some moneyed capital in the State, without violating any shared tax on national banks by Section 5219, so long as certain essential tests always laid down by this Court to protect an investor in national bank stock was meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.171" offset="7296084">One of them was that it was a partial exemption only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.211" offset="7312175">In other words, it was permitting the states for public policy purposes, to carve out some species of property that may be characterized as moneyed capital.</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.050" offset="11559581">And in that legislation, Congress spelled out the purpose of that -- of the creation of the federal Home Owners' Loan -- creation of the federal savings and loan institutions under this statute and it there said that such associations shall loan their funds only on the security of their shares or the security of first liens upon homes or combinations of homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.671" offset="11786010">We're on pages 15 and 16,.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.685" offset="11794160">Congress spells out generally, what they have done in reference to the creation of federal savings and loan associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.942" offset="11823104">Now, the state associations in question are patterned identically after these federal associations and our statutory analysis in our brief will indicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.343" offset="11884753">But then on page 17 of our brief, Congress made it abundantly clear what it was going to require of the states in reference to the taxation of these mutual thrift institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.109" offset="11951835">It there said, "No state territorial county, municipal or local taxing authority shall impose any tax on such associations or their franchise capital reserve surplus loans or income greater than that imposed by such authority on other similar, local, mutual or cooperative thrift in home financing institutions."</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.456" offset="12057161">Now, we maintain that Congress in -- in 1933, contrary to the appellant's contention, set forth the purpose of these institutions and told the states what norm to use in taxing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.007" offset="12135424">Now we simply assert that this is in pari materia legislation, it must be read in conjunction with Section 5219 and that the states only have to concern themselves in taxing mutual institutions like this, with similar mutual institutions and not with what is done with national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.930" offset="12227062">Now, it's interesting to know what Congress did in reference to providing for the taxation of both the joint land banks and the national agricultural credit associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.279" offset="12296443">The taxation provisions were relative to -- those two associations is set out on page 159 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.358" offset="12332805">Now, there, Congress tied in to 5219 and to the taxation of national bank stocks, the taxation of the stock of joint-stock land banks and the stock of National Agricultural Credit Corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.650" offset="12410023">In other words, a stock-type institution operating in the financial field created by Congress was tied into 5219 language and test, while a mutual institution such as the savings and loan association was -- was related to an entirely different kind of test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.430" offset="12529142">In the treatment of the savings and loan associations under the federal income tax law, which has been a subject by the way, of much controversy between banks and savings and loan associations, Congress saw fit to treat and classify these two institutions decidedly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.372" offset="12628825">In reference to the savings and loan associations, they created a bad debt reserve of 12% of the income of these institutions and also permitted the institutions to deduct their dividends to their shareholders in the same way as banks were permitted to deduct the interest paid to their depositors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.313" offset="12760586">Also, Congress, when it created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and insured people who placed their moneys on deposit in banks against laws, also saw fit to treat by analogy, an investment or a deposit in a savings and loan share account and this was done by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.546" offset="12873540">Congress again treat in this mutual fund of a savings and loan association that has no equity capital and has not stock, the equivalent with the bank deposit which is the kind of equation the State believes to be equitable and fair in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.209" offset="12960162">Also, Congress, in legislating in the District of Columbia, according to the appellant's theory of equality, is now discriminating 3 to 1 against the gross income of national banking institutions in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.914" offset="13055039">And in 1923, this Statute, Section 5219 was amended by the Congress and considered in detail after this Court's decision in the Richmond case in 256 U.S. and the congressional record there shows that Congress was well aware of this Court's treatment of mutual savings banks and other mutual institutions as being without the purview of Section 5219.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.046" offset="13191607">And that also, this Court was well aware of the fact that this Court had concluded in the Clement National Bank case that bank deposits were not within the protection of Section 5219.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.874" offset="13254823">And thus, in the 1923 Amendment, Congress again by not making any provision to overrule the judicial pronouncement of this Court, again made it manifest and abundantly clear that they were not going to compare a savings and loan share account with a -- with a share of national bank stock for Section 5219 purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.190" offset="13360149">Admittedly, as appellant says, it is a share of stock, but a "tree" is also a tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.712" offset="13410200">In the instant case, there's no equity that a person can possibly obtain by placing a dollar with a savings and loan share account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.384" offset="13452936">These savings and loan associations stand ready and open to accept other depositors on the same level, on the same basis as their existing depositors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.438" offset="13501106">If a person withdraws the money, only thing that they can withdraw under the federal statute and the Michigan statute is the dollar that they put in plus dividends paid out of current earnings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.090" offset="13951770">I mean, in other words, we see a consistent pattern of decisions of this Court ruling out mutual savings bank, savings deposit, savings and loan association up to the Hoeing case, up to the Shreveport case of this Court of 1933, up to the Tradesmens case by this Court in 1940, we -- and we see paralleling that a congressional enactment that would support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.207" offset="14056155">And essentially then, we are saying that -- that Congress has made it clear that they do not consider a mutual institution such as they created under the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, comparable to a -- a savings and loan -- comparable to a national bank capital, which is protected by 5219.</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.827" offset="14250715">Yes, Your Honor, I would very much like to comment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.843" offset="14266702">Number one, the associations that I have just referred to in regard to public policy, were created in 1933 by Congress and so, his assertion that there's no public policy reason for distinct treatment of these institutions is rather belied by what Congress actually did in 1933 and what kind of institution that they said they were creating under the General Welfare Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.112" offset="14387806">And also, the testimony in this cause clearly indicates that the changes that he is talking about are changes of form without substance that the -- essence of their mutuality is that they have no stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.067" offset="14451649">There are a mutual concern corporation or a mutual body and that it is a vehicle created expressly by Congress and for the states for the purpose of promoting thrift savings and home ownership and there has not been in the record of this cause that would lead anyone to assume that an established public policy of 100 years should now be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.561" offset="14561573">And I should say in this connection that there are -- were several cases in the -- in this Court involving the status of mutual savings bank under 5219 and each time the bank came before this Court, they argued that now, we have a -- institution different in character, different in scope than -- that of the other institutions that the Court ruled upon in the prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.623" offset="14693857">Now, I might say in closing that there is one aspect of the whole area that the appellant has failed to note, in terms of trying to possibly bring Section 5219 up to date and that is that in 1864 when the statute we're talking about was first enacted, banks' capital -- equity capital amounted to 60% of their employable assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="3707.843" offset="14934706">Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.859" offset="14946826">Within the limited few minutes I have left, I'll endeavor to answer two or three basic errors in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.330" offset="14980681">The basic error of appellee's argument and of Professor Woodward is the appellee does not like R.S. 5219, which is a tax on shares of national banks and he only wants the comparison made not with other moneyed capital in any form, but only with institutions which have the power to take deposits and to do a general banking business, because there is no business whatsoever which may take deposits except a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.975" offset="15187257">This Court has held that other moneyed capital is not limited to banking institutions or the institutions which may take deposits, you've said it in Richmond, you've said it in Hartford and you've said it in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.355" offset="15268760">And Congress, on several occasions, was asked to change the law to limit it to other banks and refused to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.138" offset="15315884">This is a tax on shares and not on all of the assets of the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.495" offset="15357367">The same argument advanced by appellee was advanced by the State of Minnesota in the Minnesota case where they too said, "Banks can do business on deposits forgetting that they had to pay those deposits, they're liabilities" and said, "Compare the tax burden not on shares or total assets deducting the deposit liability."</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.179" offset="15464051">The State of Minnesota made the same argument, but this Court said, "Oh, no, this is a share tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.213" offset="15492263">You must compare the net assets after deducting liability or the capital stock."</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.597" offset="15521729">Moneyed capital therefore, can mean the investment of an individual who may not take deposits and the investment of any business, which may not take deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.755" offset="15582438">And I submit the Shreveport case, sustains our position because that case was raised on two questions and that followed Hartford shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.337" offset="15632697">Number one, the State -- the bank attacked it on the Fourteenth Amendment that savings and loan were not like banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.121" offset="15667806">On the Fourteenth Amendment, there was a reasonable classification, but on the second ground of attack that it violated this revised statute, the national bank tax act, the Court did not say it was of a different character and couldn't come under R.S. 5219, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.831" offset="15758712">Mr. Justice Brandeis went into the question and said, "There was no competition in fact, the banks weren't competing or the savings and loan weren't competing with the banks."</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.492" offset="15813360">He wouldn't have discussed that had he held that there were such different comparable character that they couldn't as a matter of law, compete with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.127" offset="15859858">Now, on the proposition, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, "Little fellow versus big fellow."</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.336" offset="15892668">In this instance, there are 67 savings and loan associations and 77 national banks in Michigan and if you check the chart on page 17, you will see that those 67 savings and loan associations did a far greater residential mortgage business, then the 77 national banks, including appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.736" offset="15994337">And if Your Honors would be good enough to see what has happened on page 81 of our brief, the growth of these savings and loan associations since the change in character in 1935, has been phenomenal both in Michigan, it has gone up from 1940, from a $116,000,000 to $537,000,000, till today, it's over $1,200,000,000 and nationally, the growth has gone from $5,000,000,000 in 1940 to $63,000,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.470" offset="16157236">So, these aren't little institutions which are helpless.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.706" offset="16174164">They have had a phenomenal growth and their in the mortgage business has been at least three times greater than the growth of national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.353" offset="16212825">Now, this reference to Mr. Chief Justice about state banks complaining or other banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.079" offset="16247724">The Michigan Banker's Association as an association did not take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.812" offset="16274578">It was a three or four-man committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.268" offset="16288475">They were asked later when it came to our attention to submit it to the membership for a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.072" offset="16315643">They refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.770" offset="16326405">Sixty odd banks including state banks sir, attempted to file a brief amicus in this Court, protesting the position taken by this tax committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.824" offset="16378650">And this tax committee on the proof of this Attorney General went to the state legislature because -- not because they thought this tax was a valid tax, they didn't want a state income tax and they preferred this to a state income tax and said, "We will assist the State to defend this tax, this tax of doubtful validity, if its validity is attacked by a national bank" and they certainly cannot bargain away the rights given to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.622" offset="16533817">The small tax committee has no power to bargain away our rights under the law and rights of other national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.439" offset="16569135">Thank you.</text>
