            <label>Mr. Louis L. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="17.163" offset="174122">May it please Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.857" offset="192825">William H. Burton, a resident of Wilmington, Delaware, has appealed to this Court from a decision of the Supreme Court of Delaware, sanctioning on the authority of a Delaware statute, his exclusion on the ground of race and color from a restaurant, located in a building, owned and operated by a public agency, the Wilmington Parking Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.153" offset="354053">The Authority is created in pursuance of a Delaware statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.410" offset="379026">This statute is set forth in full in the appendix to the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.948" offset="417165">The function of the Authority, as set out in the statute, is to plan, construct, and operate facilities for offstreet parking of automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.711" offset="492293">The Act declares this a public purpose for the benefit of the residents of cities, for the promotion of their health and safety and living conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.541" offset="559585">Accordingly, the Act declares that the Authority is a public agency and is vested with the performance of essential governmental functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.400" offset="619039">Members of the Authority are appointed by the Mayor of the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.363" offset="638892">The Authority is given the power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.795" offset="660626">Its property is declared exempt from Delaware taxation, and the revenue bonds issued by the Authority are declared exempt from Delaware taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.191" offset="722171">The Act provides that municipalities may contribute funds to the Authority for the purchase of land upon which the parking facilities are to be erected.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.089" offset="797821">The site in question, located in the City of Wilmington, is an area about 178 feet by 350 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.013" offset="849439">It is in the center of downtown Wilmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.123" offset="869919">Prior to its present use, this site had been owned by several private owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.892" offset="908999">It was purchased by the Wilmington Parking Authority from funds derived from three sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.161" offset="954034">Part of the funds, approximately $934,000, was a contribution made by the City of Wilmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.614" offset="995830">The rest of the funds were derived from the revenue bonds, the proceeds of revenue bonds of the Authority, and from a bank loan made to the Authority on the credit of the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.701" offset="1056225">The act under which the Authority is created provides that the Authority may lease portions of the facility for commercial use, if the Authority has made a determination that such leasing is necessary to enable the Authority to carry on its public function.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.026" offset="1165521">In the record there is the affidavit of the Chairman of the Authority, attesting that such a determination, that is, a determination that leasing Was necessary in order to enable the Authority to function, was made by the Authority.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis L. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="304.988" offset="1325390">The statute does not use the word "private," sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.978" offset="1337302">It simply says "for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.737" offset="1368336">One of the areas of space in the facility building was leased to the appellee, Eagle.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.911" offset="1417028">Eagle is a corporation organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and its lease with the Authority was for a period of twenty years, with an option to renew for ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.606" offset="1471885">And the lease, which is set forth in the record, provides that this space shall be used for a restaurant, a banquet hall, a cocktail lounge, a bar, and for no other use.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.000" offset="1565403">The lease also provides, among other terms, that the lessee shall occupy and use the premises in accordance with all applicable laws and rules and regulations of the federal or state or municipal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.356" offset="1654847">The lease is dated April 8th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.500" offset="1679402">There is in the record, however, an affidavit which has not been disputed by appellees that prior to the date of this lease a voluntary citizens group had discussed with the Chairman of the Authority, their interest in having a policy of racial nondiscrimination followed in the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.323" offset="1798729">In August 1958, the appellant Burton was refused food service in the restaurant because of his color.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.090" offset="1845750">In a class action brought behalf of himself and other Negroes, he filed a suit in Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Authority and the restaurant for a declaratory judgment that the policy racial exclusion practiced by the restaurant was in violation of the restraints of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and for an injunction to restrain his discriminatory exclusion from the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.461" offset="2003216">The defendants, the Authority and Eagle, filed separate answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.266" offset="2026517">The Authority said, in its answer, that it had no power under its lease or under any federal or state law to control its lessee and the lessee also said that it was not controlled by the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.068" offset="2117736">Both of them, both answers, stated that Eagle operated as a private entrepreneur and both of them pleaded the statute which is here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.456" offset="2187222">They set the statute out in their answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.807" offset="2200597">It is Title 24 of the Delaware Code, Section 1501 and they said in their answers that, on the basis of this statute, they were entitled to exclude the plaintiff, the appellant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.829" offset="2296728">I should like to call Your Honors' attention to this statute which we have set out in full at page three of appellants' brief appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.009" offset="2345420">It provides that no keeper of an inn, tavern, hotel, or restaurant or other place of public entertainment or refreshment of travelers, guests or customers, shall be obliged by law to furnish entertainment or refreshment to persons whose reception or entertainment by him would be offensive to the major part of his customers and would injure his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.830" offset="2464747">It defines customers as including all who have occasion for entertainment or refreshment.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.933" offset="2501110">I might say that although both answers pleaded the statute, neither answer contained an averment, a direct averment, that the plaintiff had been found offensive to a major part of the customers, or that the business of the restaurant had been in any way impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.978" offset="2605286">After filing the answers, the defendants moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.191" offset="2626184">They again pleaded the statute and claimed that under the statute, they had a right to exclude the plaintiff on the ground of color.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.652" offset="2728061">They did file, both defendants filed sir, motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.456" offset="2751258">There was at that point an unresolved issue of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.763" offset="2808519">The court, of course, could not decide this matter with that issue of fact remaining unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.749" offset="2836417">The appellee, Eagle, then moved to amend its answer, and that answer is contained in the record and in that amendment it admitted that the only reason for refusal of service to the plaintiff here was his race, color, and ancestry.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.225" offset="3154275">That is, in the context in which this matter comes up, this is the only thing that can be inferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.832" offset="3228776">The trial court, after the omission was repaired by the filing of an amended answer, heard arguments in the matter and received briefs, of course, first and after briefs had been filed and oral argument had been had, the trial court requested the plaintiffs' counsel to file a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.147" offset="3358030">This was done, and two days later the trial court handed down its opinion which is, of course, part of the record, in which it decided that because the rentals constitute a substantial and integral part of the means devised to finance this vital public facility, and those are the words used by the trial court, it was incumbent upon the Authority to make leases which would require the tenant to carry out the Authority's constitutional duty not to deny the Delawareans the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.532" offset="3551545">The Authority, although -- although the Authority and Eagle defended on the ground of the statute in part, because the vice chancellor felt that there was state action in the operation of this restaurant, he found it unnecessary to consider the statute and he indicated in his opinion that it was unnecessary to consider the validity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.583" offset="3699712">The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Delaware, and it was there pointed out in briefs and oral argument that there had been no proof as to the elements of offense, an injury to business.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.694" offset="3788215">And they took the same position, the Authority there took the position before the Supreme Court which it had taken before the trial court, and that was that they did not need to offer proof that plaintiff, as a Negro, was offensive, that it was a notorious fact that, being a Negro he was offensive and that the court could, in the language of the Authority in its brief, "The court could resort to a judicial shortcut and take judicial notice of the fact that persons of a certain class, meaning Negroes the class to which the plaintiff belonged, "were per se offensive," was the language used in the brief of the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.471" offset="4031258">In spite of the absence of any evidence as to offensiveness and injury to business, the Supreme Court validated this interpretation which the Authority insisted upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.349" offset="4086847">It held that Eagle was acting in a purely private capacity and that under the statute it was not required to serve the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.234" offset="4130314">Accordingly, the Supreme Court of Delaware reversed the vice chancellor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.240" offset="4154347">Now, it is appellant's position that this Court has jurisdiction of this appeal because the Supreme Court of Delaware has construed and applied the statute to authorize appellant's exclusion on the ground of race from this restaurant, and that this application of the statute has been made in spite of the challenge made to the statute on constitutional grounds by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.928" offset="4293110">We'd first like to point out that it's clear that exclusion of appellant as a Negro is not within the express terms of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.484" offset="8495376">We'd like to examine each of these grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.231" offset="8514393">First the court said that the establishment of a restaurant in his facility was a happenstance, and that the restaurant was not intended as a service to the public using the parking facility that the only interest of the Authority was in obtaining income from rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.796" offset="8596626">The answer to that seems to be that there is no evidence one way or another as to whether or not the location of the restaurant in the Authority was a happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.381" offset="8634974">This matter was decided on summary judgment and there was no evidence as to how the restaurant, rather than something else, happened to be located there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.523" offset="8687532">But we say that, more important than this ground that the Supreme Court used, was the interest of the Authority in obtaining rental income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.783" offset="8736538">And this interest was completely coextensive with the interest of the Authority in performing its public function, that it could not have performed its public function if there had not been this rental income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.629" offset="9679976">Our position is that, whatever may be the rule with respect to discrimination by a private enterprise upon privately owned property, the denial of equal protection upon racial grounds in a restaurant otherwise open to the general public on state-owned property, indeed in a state building, under the circumstances of this case, results in unconstitutional discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.679" offset="9804110">I think I should say that my argument would be the same even if the statute were not in the case, perhaps somewhat unlike Mr. Redding and it seems to me that although I do not think that we ought to take part in a discussion of whether appeal is a proper remedy, in all candor it seems to me that to entertain my argument, the Court would probably have to grant the request that the appeal be treated as a request for certiorari under 28 U.S. Code 1257.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.975" offset="10021345">The Wilmington Parking Authority is admittedly a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.700" offset="10040257">It's also common ground, as I read the opinion below and the briefs in this case, that if the Authority operated the Eagle Coffee Shop on these premises, any discrimination based upon race or color would violate petitioner's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.344" offset="10114759">Consequently, the only question here is whether the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment are nullified or perhaps I should say "dropped out of the case" because the State has leased the restaurant to a private enterprise rather than operating it directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.533" offset="10547555">It leased space in a building, to a restauranteur and I meant to refer to the space, rather than to the restaurant company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.862" offset="10580888">No, there was no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.374" offset="10590919">I think we must concede, on the State's part in having a restaurant and we do concede, first, that this was a private enterprise, and second, that the State had no particular interest in there being eating facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.212" offset="10650269">Nevertheless, conceding that much, we think that the conclusion that the state courts drew does not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.754" offset="10680466">In our opinion the Parking Authority was still sufficiently involved to say that the discrimination was the result of state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.785" offset="10724561">Later in my argument I will detail the points of contact or involvement, beginning particularly with the fact that this was a State owned building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.434" offset="10767193">It's enough I think, for present purposes to say that the cumulative effect of those points of contact or participation can best be summarized by saying that the State is operating this building, in the words of the Delaware Supreme Court in an earlier case, "as a single self-sustaining governmental unit."</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.034" offset="10845560">In other words, it's bound together and it's suffused by a governmental character and it is doing that without according its citizens equality of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.974" offset="10897283">I would like first to say a few words about the general standard of state action or state participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.138" offset="10933959">When the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment declared that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, and that no state should deny the equal protection of the laws, they prescribed every form and degree of state activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.112" offset="11009818">Legislative, judicial, or executive action may, of course, all violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.597" offset="11039807">Even the action of state officials acting outside the scope of their authority may violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.955" offset="11069273">If discrimination occurs in the management of property or the performance of either proprietary or governmental functions, in the old phrase, again, the Fourteenth Amendment is called into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.150" offset="11122040">As this Court said in the Arkansas school case, Cooper and Aaron, for the purposes of applying the Fourteenth Amendment to public education, there is state action where there is state participation through any arrangement, management, funds, or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.050" offset="11197586">There are two further points I would like to make with reference to the test of state participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.823" offset="11224754">One I think really goes to the root of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.254" offset="11238442">It's particularly important to note that state action and private action leading to racial discrimination should not be viewed as if they were mutually exclusive causes, and that either one or the other must be responsible, but not both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.494" offset="11307405">Quite the contrary I think is true, and this is well illustrated by the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.654" offset="11327990">Here plainly there is discrimination by a private person, the restaurant and we don't contend that that is the action of a state agency, but the fact that the action of the restaurant is one cause of the wrong does not exculpate the State if the State's activities are also a substantial contributing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.193" offset="11426210">The Court's decisions make it abundantly clear that the Fourteenth Amendment is brought into play when the discrimination results, as it does here we think, from a concurrence of state and private activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.063" offset="11481694">And the other point that I would want to emphasize in this connection is that it is not necessary that the decision to discriminate, the decision to discriminate be made by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.592" offset="11531745">Shelley and Kraemer seems to me to illustrate both those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.626" offset="11547941">The racial covenants were in private contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.059" offset="11561629">The discrimination resulted from a concurrence of the private contract and the state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2877.661" offset="11616068">But I think -- I suggest that the point still is that it took the concurrence of two and so that this goes back to my earlier point that private action and state action what may be concurrent causes and the State still responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.113" offset="11677821">And in the Girard Trust Company, the initiation of this discrimination came from the will of Stephen Girard and the State, the City indeed, acted in scarcely more than a ministerial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.769" offset="11740515">In both cases the Fourteenth Amendment was applied, despite the concurrence of the two forms of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.591" offset="11779803">In other words, we think that state action implies no particular formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.966" offset="11801328">If the wrong is done solely by one private citizen to another then of course under the Civil Rights Cases the Fourteenth Amendment does not come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.027" offset="11845528">On the other hand if the activities or authority of the State cause or contribute to the unjust discrimination, even though they're not the sole cause, then it seems to us that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated In other words, the question is one of judgment and degree and the standard is a pragmatic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.117" offset="11937896">I come now to the elements of state participation in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.438" offset="11967154">The first and major element of state participation is its ownership of the property on which the discrimination occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.500" offset="12003412">This was property held by the Authority for the benefit of all the people of Delaware equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.346" offset="12026817">Yet it's used, in both a literal and a legal sense, as the very foundation of unequal treatment.</text>
