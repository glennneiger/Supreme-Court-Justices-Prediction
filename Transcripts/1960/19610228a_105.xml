            <text syncTime="690.008" offset="2863417">He then quotes the statute in full and says, It is clearly, therefore, that the provision of Section 101.44, supra, grant immunity to the witnesses as to any incriminating matter concerning which they might testify had they entered the questions propounded to them by the said Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.154" offset="2943979">There may be one exception to this as one of the questions appeared to deal with whether or not false testimony had been given at a previous time before a grand jury of this county.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.439" offset="4521148">These appellants were subpoenaed to be -- to appear before an Ohio Commission investigating in the area of subversion, an area fully occupied by Congress in which the state has no power to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.251" offset="4576423">This is also an area involving rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the essential rights referred to by Bill Of Rights James Madison as quoted in Knapp at page 377, the rights of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.298" offset="4632534">It is not an area of traditional power to investigate in aid of prosecuting conventional state crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.591" offset="4833782">Now, most of the cases that we've done research on involving immunity statutes, I should think -- I believe all of them, as far as I can recall, involved grand jury investigations into crying and hearings before administry -- administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.750" offset="4910373">Now, this is a fundamental distinction between such proceedings and hearings before a legislative investigating committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.877" offset="4954885">It functions as part of the judicial system and is an agency in administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.740" offset="4982366">A legislative investigating committee has no authority to act as a grand jury or to discover the commission of crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.879" offset="5030849">The theory behind all immunity acts is that the questioning body has the authority to compel testimony even if it may incriminate the witness and has the authority to grant a pardon in advance or otherwise, protect the witness from subsequent prosecution as to matters touched in this compelled testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.677" offset="7002049">So that there is no confusion arising from these matters of state law, although I grant they are not relevant for the purpose of this argument, I would like to state that, first of all, I did not prosecute these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.230" offset="7068296">I was not prosecuting attorney for Stark County in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.037" offset="7087522">I took office in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.140" offset="7099956">In the State of Ohio, criminal prosecutions are handled on the county level by each of the 88 county prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.109" offset="7135796">The Attorney General is not a criminal prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.360" offset="7152828">He's the lawyer for the Governor of the State and the various state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.687" offset="7170069">When there is a crime on state property or when there has been a fraud against the state or when there is some reason for a special investigation, the Attorney General may be directed by the Governor to prosecute the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.273" offset="7224508">So, it is very unusual to see an Attorney General in any case at any level in our state criminal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.169" offset="7260035">The second thing that needs to be pointed out in this particular case is that there were some serious state law questions which arose at the time the Un-American Activities Commission of the Ohio General Assembly was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.143" offset="7323982">Those questions have been resolved in 164 Ohio State by the Ohio Supreme Court, and I don't discuss them to argue them, but they explain how these cases came up the way they are, why we're still here and why the Ohio courts feel bound to send these cases up here to the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.434" offset="7413112">First of all, there was a considerable problem in the state law level about the power of the Ohio General Assembly to create a commission which existed beyond its sine die adjournment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.736" offset="7494301">That question has been resolved in favor of the validity of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.876" offset="7510915">But for that reason, they did not appoint a committee, such as the Congress has, for the investigating of Un-American Activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.552" offset="7545605">This is not a United States Congress type of committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.260" offset="7556368">This is a commission created and given birth to by the Legislature so that it may operate under Ohio law after the adjournment of the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.828" offset="7602657">Now, they called it a commission and you will observe, when you read the Ohio immunity statute, it says any person who testifies before a committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.532" offset="7653543">At the time, there were a lot of very good criminal lawyers who had serious doubts that the immunity statute which was specifically in terms criminal statutes being strictly construed against the State, since the defendant can commit no error in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.071" offset="7731702">They felt there was a serious question as to whether this immunity statute was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.221" offset="7752286">For that reason, apparently, the Un-American Activities Commission, when it met for the Morgan, Raley and Stern cases, elected to play it safe and told its witnesses, You may seek refuge behind the privilege against self-incrimination."</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.393" offset="7828982">Apparently, to me, they felt there was no sense in telling these people they had an immunity at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.622" offset="7849880">So they -- they told them that they could rely on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.322" offset="7868688">Apparently, what happened was that, thereafter, the Un-American Activities Commission, having questioned witnesses and moved off from the scene, some eager beaver grand jury at the county level, decided that this had been terrible that these witnesses had refused to answer, and they indicted them under the Ohio Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.148" offset="7960012">These are not indictments in the instant case under the Ohio Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.699" offset="7978193">The Raley, Morgan and Stern cases were indictments under the Ohio Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.372" offset="7996897">In Ohio, there are no common law crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.118" offset="8007868">All crimes are codified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.036" offset="8015496">So, there was an indictment under the Ohio Criminal Code returned for the crime of failing to testify before a committee of the state legislature, a specific crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.407" offset="8068995">When that case went to the Supreme Court of Ohio, there was a 4-to-3 split in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.320" offset="8096684">Judge Stewart recognized right off the bat that under Ohio law, as a matter of fact, Morgan, Raley and Brown and even Stern were not guilty as a matter of fact of the crime of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.679" offset="8166066">This business of entrapment is aside from the mark, as a criminal lawyer understands entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.476" offset="8189262">That is the inducement to do a substantive wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.093" offset="8199711">As I understand Judge Stewart's ruling, it was, as a matter of fact, there is no guilt at all because they were not in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.047" offset="8231581">They were told, You may take the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.835" offset="8242761">The witnesses say Thanks, we'll take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.418" offset="13465057">The issues in this case are, first of all, whether the privilege against self-incrimination afforded by the Federal Constitution is a privilege and immunity of federal citizenship, whether it is part of due process as -- as binding on state courts under the Fourteenth Amendment and whether, as a matter of fact, Knapp versus Schweitzer, which authorizes that sort of whiplashing, ought to be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.268" offset="13612492">That's a substantial issue in the opinion of a prosecuting attorney about a rule of law that, as a matter of fact, is very little, if no, help at all in obtaining of evidence for the prosecution of crime because unwilling witnesses are no help to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.309" offset="13676648">That's substantially involved in this case because three of these witnesses were directly ordered to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.579" offset="13705697">They were told they had immunity, and they said, We don't want any of that state immunity business because you're asking us about questions for which we could go to the federal pen under the Smith Act, and I think that's a substantial federal question that the defendants are entitled to raise and have preserved in the record and have borne their burden of proof on appeal which they did not do in the Raley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.389" offset="13792946">The second issue that I believe is involved in this case is whether the Ohio Commission is allowed to ask these questions of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.347" offset="13840802">I think that is settled by the Uphaus case, which was reported in the same volume as the Raley case and the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.379" offset="13872880">Thirdly, there is involved because the first witness, Mrs. Perry, took the First Amendment, as well as the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendment, whether there is involved some question about her rights of freedom to assemble, free speech, free religion, to petition the Assembly, all of these questions that were discussed yesterday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.601" offset="13973817">I think that's involved in Mrs. Perry's case as to whether or not this fact situation is a Barenblatt type of situation where the questions are directly about Communist affiliation or whether it's a Sweezy question where they ask you about a speech or a lecture at a university and your membership and the progress report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.417" offset="14065037">That's in this case, in Mrs. Perry's convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.596" offset="14085726">Also in this case is the question of whether or not they have expressed a legislative interest for an inquiry and whether they have articulated it to the person summoned in every single question for which there is a conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="4579.681" offset="18422053">On page 90, which Mr. Putman already called to your attention, is the first reference that this Commission made to the immunity statute by calling the witnesses' attention to the fact that Judge Bryant had made this decision in Franklin County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.686" offset="18490075">And then later, with witness Paul Bohus, on page 111 of this record before the Court now, the attorney for the Commission said this, after Paul Bohus said, I invoke the Fifth Amendment, he said, the attorney said, at page 111 in this record at the bottom of the page, I'm going to assume that your counsel has fully instructed you in the effects of this decision by Judge Bryant of the Franklin County Common Pleas Court and has also instructed you about your rights under the state and federal constitutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4645.471" offset="18685262">The counsel goes on and says I suggest that you discuss with your counsel that if a ruling by Franklin County Common Pleas Court in a criminal case can be classed as a private opinion of one judge, you may find it has a more far-reaching effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.646" offset="18742000">The witness answers, after conferring with his counsel, It is not a matter of private opinion, but it is just one man's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.803" offset="18774601">Now, that was the only two places that this record will show that there was any discussion about immunity, and that was only with Paul Bohus and with Olga Perry, and I submit to this Court that that certainly was not an offer of immunity to either one of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.370" offset="18844818">As a matter of fact, at page 92, right after Mrs. Perry, on -- at page 90, had declined to answer and he first -- the counsel first called the attention of this decision to her, on page 92, he says I may point," this is the attorney for the Commission himself saying this, I may point out that the ruling of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County has ruled otherwise but as you sated in your opinion, that is just one man's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.826" offset="18958712">He was agreeing with what the witness had said.</text>
