            <text syncTime="72.582" offset="393697">That he had been subpoenaed and that according to newspaper accounts, a man named Ross Richardson who had been a Cornell, a classmate of Mr. Deutch's had named him as having been a member of the Communist Party while he was a graduate and also an undergraduate student at Cornell.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.437" offset="473109">This letter about Mr. Richardson who was at that time an agent, an employee of the FBI he knew only from a newspaper account.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.048" offset="515532">The subcommittee as it transpired by a later publication of a committee text was composed of Congressman Jackson as Chairman, Congressman Doyle and Congressman Scherer.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.839" offset="662758">If I may read it aloud, Mr. Deutch during hearings at Albany last week, the Committee heard testimony regarding the existence of a Communist Party group or cell operating among undergraduates of Cornell University among certain graduates at Cornell and in the City of Ithaca.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.352" offset="728795">In connection with that testimony, the Committee was informed that you were a member of one or more of those groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.117" offset="795878">After objecting to the jurisdiction of the Committee and under protest as Deutch said as to the constitutionality of the proceedings, Deutch stated, "Yes, he had been a member of the Communist Party that he no longer was."</text>
            <text syncTime="187.618" offset="853870">He then proceeded under questioning to tell all about the size, the nature, the scope, the activities of this student group.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.566" offset="901622">He said, When I was a -- in the Communist Party, all that happened were bull sessions on Marxism and some activities like giving out a leaflet or two.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.633" offset="965883">He then told about how Mr. Richardson, the FBI employee was his group leader, how he collected his dues and took him to meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.500" offset="1001409">In fact, he said the last meeting that he had had was with Mr. Ross Richardson alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.967" offset="1019277">He told how the campus group became defunct.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.857" offset="1030771">How it consisted of about four or five people in the proceeding period that before it became as he said virtually defunct.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.022" offset="1059506">He said he never knew where the local branch of the Communist Party was.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.187" offset="1072149">He didn't know of the central Committee of Ithaca or what it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.660" offset="2201997">Four points of the argument are first of all the almost now traditional Watkins' point of subject matter and the pertinency of the questions thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.075" offset="2235643">The second point unique in this case is the fair of the Government's proof at trial to conform at all with the record and the change -- since the Barenblatt case in the Government's position as to what the subject under inquiry was.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.834" offset="2298755">The third point is that in the context of this kind of investigation and with the information so fully supplied by the witness that the names of individuals per se could never be acquired in this kind of investigation pursuant to a valid legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.306" offset="2368554">And the fourth point is that in applying the balancing test suggested by this Court in the Barenblatt case between the First Amendment rights of the petitioner and the investigative power of the Congress that if there is ever to be a case in which that balance must still in favor of the First Amendment in terms of congressional committees, it -- it must be this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.283" offset="2448488">Now, the first point which I have designated as the Watkins' point, I must perforce by reason of time deal with in a most summary fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.885" offset="2482866">We know that the requirement of this Court has been that the subject matter and the pertinency of the questions thereto appear to the witness at the time with indisputable clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.271" offset="2528423">On this, we must recall that we now are talking about subject matter and pertinency of the questions only those that the petitioner refused to answer whether it was clear to him that the subject in general was communism at Cornell would not satisfy the requirement of the particular question such as Homer Owen, such as the source of $100 contribution, such as the student who recruited him, that pertinency and the link between it and the subject matter we say must appear with clarity.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.784" offset="3538526">Now, sir, as to did the witness raise this point, we say if he has to say pertinency, he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.374" offset="3572903">We think that in the colloquy, immediately concerning whether he should, so to speak, telling other people, in lay language in -- I set that forth Your Honor in this page and half, in lay language he in effect did raise this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.026" offset="3647509">That's on page 26 and all the way and down through 27.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.122" offset="3703829">It's very flattering to me but I didn't know anymore about the pertinency point in April of 1954 than the people who wrote the Watkins brief before this Court who didn't mention it three years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.043" offset="3747506">But I do think it's important to note that the counsel, you know, can't make any objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.855" offset="6074807">He said there was a practice we found or we thought there might be where certain students in the Industrial Relation School at Cornell took summer jobs and in that way, they get into the UE.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.493" offset="6117334">And the Committee wanted to find out about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.321" offset="6280652">I think the witness would lean that as the hearing went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.778" offset="6298520">I think we require more than that but my point now is that Section -- Title 2192 does not punish or contempt -- refuse to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.575" offset="6341674">It punishes only a refusal to answer a question pertinent to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.148" offset="6363930">There must, therefore, be proved that trial a subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.949" offset="6375215">It's an essential element of the crime and we have a right to have the subject proved which is one, which corresponds to the facts of the hearing and at trial because we have to decide whether they're cross-examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.922" offset="6427042">I didn't cross-examine Mr. Tavenner because he'd been busy proving that the subject was labor infiltration in the Albany area and I knew that -- that you could look at the hearing to your heart's content, you never see a single question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.230" offset="6484302">And the defendant might have taken the stand or the argument might have been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.753" offset="7678412">Under the ruling of this Court in Watkins reinforced in Barenblatt where it's been held in traditional view that these Committees are restricted to acquiring that certain data which Congress needs in order to legislate that the names per se of witnesses could not be pursuant to a valid legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.409" offset="7760959">Now, we don't say that this could never be true in a congressional investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.724" offset="7782275">It might be, for instance, particularly in investigation of Government itself but where the investigation is -- has into -- in a field like this and where the witness has disclosed these broad aspects could names themselves be legislative data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.084" offset="7843715">The legislative function as Court has said is certainly not exposure so they could not have wanted them for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.559" offset="7869628">They're not -- the legislative branch is not on the business of compiling dossiers of people or finding who's been guilty of wrong doing or wrong thinking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.933" offset="7911111">They could hardly legislate in the sense with respect to particular persons and without running a file of the bill of attainder provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.487" offset="7937337">And we think therefore under the document of separation of powers, it would be hard to see how the names alone would be necessary to the Congress in order to intelligently cope with the problem of -- of communism, the problem that they have before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.729" offset="7998255">They must know, of course, the general size, quality, shape, scope, the actions of the -- of the -- if you will, the Communist even at Cornell and all of this they got and could have gotten as much as they wanted to presumably, the witness didn't cut off the inquiry, it -- as it happened in other cases, it was only the names.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.306" offset="8072547">And we therefore, our third point is that the requirements of this Court with respect to saying that Committees are restricted to that data which Congress the parent body needs to cope with an existing legislative problem at a law enforcement problem but a legislative problem would not justify the seeking of names by compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.651" offset="8161991">Now, my last point Your Honor which is the First Amendment point, in which we take not the absolute but the relative position announced most especially by this Court in the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.300" offset="8208593">We say that to sustain this conviction in this case in the light of that balancing test is to go further than any case has and I suggest to the Court so far that it would be hard to conceive of a case in which the First Amendment rights might up way the investigative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.831" offset="8278706">Now, this Court has recognized the very real deterrent to political association with under orthodox groups involved in the prospect that those associating with such a group may later be called before congressional committee and have to own up to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.170" offset="8344012">This is the reason the First Amendment gets in to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.864" offset="8358849">Now, parenthetically, the Government has said, "Well, Deutch didn't plead the First Amendment."</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.503" offset="8377344">Well, I -- I submit that it is quite noble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.188" offset="8388106">The First Amendment is not like the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.627" offset="8401899">I don't know what they mean by pleading the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.974" offset="8411303">It is efficient on Government if it has been transgressed by Government, no process can follow from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.217" offset="8436276">And I apprehend when hundreds of First Amendment cases nobody ever plot it when Jehovah Witness, for instance, was arrested for having no license to sell handbills from door-to-door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.404" offset="8472952">I don't suppose it was inquired as to whether or not he said to the county clerk in the courthouse when he didn't get his license that he was pleading the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.232" offset="8500328">I don't think it has to be pled as novel in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.976" offset="8511300">But they then say, "But this man is actually trying to invoke the First Amendment rights of other people."</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.812" offset="8534601">Well, let it be clear that we are here invoking the First Amendment rights of this particular defendant and not others and we do it in the same way as the deterrent effect has been spoken up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.623" offset="8577860">And we say that if it's a deterrent to association with heretical movements or an orthodox movement that you may have to admit your own membership how much greater deterrent it is for a man of decency to know that he may also have to tell about the association with that movement of others and thus bring upon them the same dilemma which he then finds himself in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.526" offset="8661452">Because many men, who I say, with impurity would dare to join such movements knowing that he might have to someday answer to it, would hesitate to do so if he also has to answer as to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.026" offset="8715473">And therefore, I submit that it isn't the First Amendment rights of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.326" offset="8728639">It's the First Amendment rights of this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.377" offset="8736893">Now, as to his First Amendment rights, this Court has said that in many instances, they -- the recognize that in many instances but not at all, some circumstances they have said the First Amendment, this is Barenblatt, protects an individual from being compelled to disclose association or relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.606" offset="8813798">And then the Court said however, this is Barenblatt he quotes, Where First Amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation resolution of the issue always involved a balancing by the Court of the competing private and public interest at stake in a particular circumstances shown."</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.428" offset="8885060">I say that nobody -- no previous court has ever done that balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.177" offset="8904077">They simply say, "Well, these questions are about communism or this man was a Communist at one time."</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.862" offset="8926856">And that's really essential to Government's position today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.302" offset="8936573">How do they meet the balancing test?</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.534" offset="8941484">They meet the balancing test by saying, Well, we're an area of Communist investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.117" offset="8959875">Now, it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.707" offset="8962173">This Court has, since CIO against Douds, permitted governmental action with respect to Communist and the Communist Party which would not be permitted except for special and unique attributes of that party to wit through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.892" offset="9022986">One that although it was a political party in some respects, it shades off into a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.718" offset="9042213">Secondly that among tenants which are merely collectible, unpopular or an orthodox, there is the tenant of force and violence of the Government -- overthrow the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.289" offset="9080560">And this Court from CIO against Douds, the parent -- the Braden last week has said repeatedly that it this particular horror which has justified in this case interrogation but there are other things which would not be permitted where it not for the need for Congress be informed about this particular doctrine because of the importance of national security and self-preservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.027" offset="9175437">Now, in many other cases, intermediate steps such as, Were you a Communist?</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.228" offset="9196335">The witness himself refuses to answer or other such questions have been justified as being witness having to compel to answer because this Court has said, Well, these are preliminary to get on to this question and to find out about force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.248" offset="9252342">What happens where the witness takes them -- takes the Committee right in to the -- to the midst of the -- of the secret labyrinth and he talks about force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.423" offset="9285047">He's disclosed all he knows about force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.398" offset="9296959">And if Your Honors will bear in mind, he was under oath, he was subject of course to the pains and penalties of perjury and surely this Committee had no affection for him, a reason to protect him and -- at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.530" offset="9337501">The Government, if these were not true had available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.450" offset="9349204">His boss in the party, an FBI employee, Mr. Ross Ferguson who could have come in if this isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.035" offset="9371564">And I submit that it must be accepted on this record that this witness has said all he knows about force and violence which is this group of student that he was involved with didn't believe in it and as he said nobody ever advocated in my presence and if they had, I would not have permitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.825" offset="9434676">And he then tells the Committee upon questioning, of course, he doesn't know what the motives of the top leaders of the party is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.723" offset="9462262">Well, he's a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.644" offset="9465919">That's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.080" offset="9467695">And if doesn't know, he's exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.194" offset="9476159">Now, I say therefore to the Court that it would have the tail wagging the dog if you could have the witness who comes all the way to the question of force and violence and deals with it and this is unique in this case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.278" offset="9524433">This has never construe of any of this contempt of Congress cases that have reached this Court, and I -- I don't know of no others whether even those aren't here yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.789" offset="9558497">That whether the witness talks about force and violence and that that is the information which the committees must need to know about which justifies what would otherwise be infringement of political association rights, then I submit that that justification ceases to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.645" offset="9641984">Aside from that, however, aside from this unique feature of the case, just in the general balancing as the Court said should be done in Barenblatt, the weighing between the need for Congress to know and to get data necessary to legislate and the admitted infringement of First Amendment rights inherent in the process of compulsory testimony, where could we -- and this Court has said that if the balance still to a certain way, it will tilt in favor of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.164" offset="9764028">They -- the six scales are supposedly are indeed running -- running free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.962" offset="9787225">There may be -- must be some cases where the First Amendment will prevail over the investigative power, how can we get one that in which the need for the Government to know the connection with national security, the importance of the information that conceivably could be here, could possibly be less in proportion to the First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.748" offset="9874369">And both sides of the scale I say this case weighs higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.547" offset="9885550">First, we must have the preservation and I'm not saying again that there is a privilege sanctuary but if First Amendment rights stand high, they certainly must stand high with the student on a college campus more than even the professor because he is a student on a college campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.442" offset="9949184">If they -- if he doesn't have them the rights to be wrong if you will, the rights to make it jack ass out of himself in terms of joining this kind of a party at age of 19 and getting out at 22 or 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.413" offset="10001011">If he doesn't have them in this context and I suggest we won't find anyone whose rights in terms of communism will rise very much higher than this from the standpoint of the First Amendment and I suggest that on the other side of the scale, how can the Government of the United States and the Congress and all His Majesty be impeded by not knowing the name of the student who asked towards the age or 18 or 19 to join the Communist Party or the man that gave the $100.00.</text>
