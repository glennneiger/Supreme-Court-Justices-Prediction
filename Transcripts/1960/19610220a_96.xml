            <text syncTime="12.514" offset="153475">The question upon which we seek instruction is just to what extent a ship owner owes a seaman the duty of maintenance and cure and whether or not the obligation may be terminated or delegated.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.435" offset="241142">The court below has held that a ship owner's obligation to treat its sick or injured seamen is delegable by the expediency or by the method of tendering to a seaman a so called master certificate which is a paper signed by what the master, or one of the other officers, notifying a marine hospital that the bearer of that paper is eligible for treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.811" offset="382621">We hold that such decision is contrary to the authorities treating with the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.292" offset="428492">We believe that a ship owner's obligation for maintenance and cure just does not ceased by a mere tender of a piece of paper nor that they can delegate it by saying to somebody else, a marine hospital, “Gentlemen, this is your problem from here on.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.223" offset="508217">We've given a piece of paper to our seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.601" offset="517726">We wash our hands of further obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.513" offset="529429">It's your duty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="108.310" offset="536639">Another question which I think has been met and discussed many times by Judge Learned Hand as I've pointed out in my brief and I do not intend to repeat that which I have covered in the brief and by this Court that when we are dealing with a maritime composition, state law will not be permitted to alter, diminish or abolish the rights given to seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.128" offset="667878">There has been a great deal of talk about seamen now being represented by unions and they do not need the protection of the courts as wards of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.239" offset="712286">But realistically and based on over 35 years of experience, I still consider them as just big overgrown boys, children, they need protection now just as much as years ago.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jacob Rassner</label>
            <text syncTime="171.501" offset="789400">The plaintiff, the petitioner here was a chief steward working for the United Fruit Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.975" offset="815313">He had a goiter.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.914" offset="819075">He had an illness and he retained Dr. Fricke as his surgeon to treat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.380" offset="844884">He had had some experience with the marine hospital and was fearful of going back not knowing whether he'd get internist, a learner, a student or some experienced doctor to treat him.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.493" offset="897337">He'd had some minor ailments in the past and was quite fearful.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.942" offset="923146">He went to the United Fruit Line and said I will pay for my own doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.019" offset="939447">I've already retained him and I set forth the names of the people in debates in the amended complaint and in answers to interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.067" offset="975600">The United Fruit Line said, “You will not be permitted to hire your own doctor or we will stop your maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.606" offset="1013844">You go to the marine hospital.”</text>
            <text syncTime="230.121" offset="1023875">Obviously, the point was that if he went to his private doctor, his maintenance would continue because he does not get maintenance while in the marine hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.738" offset="1066297">He wanted his maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.867" offset="1070791">He had no means.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.706" offset="1074239">He had no choice of freedom of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.356" offset="1092838">So he discharged his own doctor and went to the marine hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.738" offset="1118333">He says that but for a promise by the United Fruit Line to indemnify him for any damages, they had a lot of conversations, many and the substance of it was if there is anything that befalls you by reason of faulty treatment or lack of treatment, we will compensate you for all your damage or loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.020" offset="1215404">That was not in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.649" offset="1225958">The court below, the trial court was a District Judge, Judge Bicks, held that the Statute of Frauds barred the action on the contract made by the United Fruit Line with the chief steward to the effect that the United Fruit Line would indemnify him for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.359" offset="1396799">Now that the same scales of justice should be employed in measuring the circumstances under which that contract was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.840" offset="1442774">But for the Statute of Frauds of the State of New York, the decision, both in the District Court and in the Circuit Court of Appeals asserts in substance that the petitioner will have a malt -- a valid cause of action for the maltreatment at the marine hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.559" offset="1573595">And our amended complaint paragraph 19 on page 5 shows that we did allege that he was not treated properly because his maintenance was just cut off and he had no freedom of action, no choice of selecting his own doctor whom he had selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.279" offset="1648515">Now we take the possession that the New York Statute of Frauds which curtails his rights, is no different in the law is applicable to relations generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.599" offset="1701804">You do not judge seamen on the basis of state law when you treat with a contract called a release and I do not see why this type of contract falls on any different category.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.593" offset="1749765">That's my personal view on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.347" offset="1756766">Now, insofar as the argument and I did not ask for time to rebuttal, I know what the arguments are by Mr. Eugene Underwood that in so far as other States, 50 States have similar statutes that doesn't make any difference because they may have similar statute as to seamen's releases.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.448" offset="2017155">There was a tort involved in the way the complaint is drawn, failure to give him cure and treatment, failure to give him his maintenance was at tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.613" offset="2057801">But we are primarily consigned with the contract at this particular discussion of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.849" offset="2094791">We take the position that the contract for maintenance and cure and I do not believe there is any room for rebuttal or refuting that contention, it is maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.602" offset="2165739">It's part of the wages of the seamen and I think this Court has expressed it any number of cases including the last six or seven that came down dealing with seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.529" offset="2213491">I have reference to the Mitchell case, (Inaudible), I have reference to the Romero case and several of the others treating with and (Inaudible) all treat with the fact that a seaman's right to maintenance and cure is part and parcel of his contract of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.061" offset="2295620">Now, if we make a distinction between the responsibility and the end result, we are taking a maritime contract and chopping it into pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.590" offset="2349746">If he is entitled to maintenance and cure, he is entitled to it by reason of his employment, his contractual relationship to the ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.086" offset="2411708">If they substitute a promise to give him money on shore for the obligation of maintenance and cure, which is certainly ashore most of the time, if not always, I do not see where the learned court below was justified into the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.193" offset="2484120">This was a contract to be performed ashore.</text>
