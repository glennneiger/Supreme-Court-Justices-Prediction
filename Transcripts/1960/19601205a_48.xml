            <text syncTime="28.324" offset="216691">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.393" offset="240933">I represent the petitioners in this case who are a group of railroad labor organizations, commonly referred to as shop craft unions as well as some of their subsidiary component local unions who were enjoined along with the respondent Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company some 15 years ago from discriminating against a group of non-union plaintiffs with respect to affording those plaintiffs' full and equal enjoyment of all of the rights given to them and other employees in their respective crafts, under collective bargaining agreements that were negotiated between this petitioner organizations in the railroad company.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.024" offset="487424">We are now here seeking for reversal of decisions of the courts below which refuse to modify that old injunction to the extent of permitting us to ask the railroad to execute a union shop, union security agreement with this petitioner labor organizations as bargaining representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.545" offset="617514">The type of agreement we sought to negotiate of course is the type that was authorized by the 1951 amendments to Railway Labor Act which came along some six years after this old injunction was issued and which subject to enumerated safeguards, did authorize union security agreements in the railroad industry which had previous had been an open shop industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.067" offset="727646">And this Court is very familiar with that in view of the decision in the Hanson case which was the first time that those 1951 amendments had been held to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.416" offset="789086">We petition for modification of this injunction in accordance with Rule 60 (b) subparagraph 5 under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which authorizes modification of an injunction in its prospective application when circumstances have so changed as to make it inequitable for the injunction to be continued in an effect -- in effect in its original form.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.200" offset="972152">Thank you.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_r_lyman" startTime="222.600" stopTime="386.758">
            <label>Mr. Richard R. Lyman</label>
            <text syncTime="222.600" offset="993782">What we asked the Courts to do was not to vacate the injunction, not to open the door to any unlawful discrimination against these original plaintiffs and members of their class, but simply to give us a pro tanto modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.211" offset="1060237">So that the injunction which at time of its issuance had declared and protected plaintiffs' rights under the Railway Labor Act as it existed at that time would now be modified so that it would protect the rights of these plaintiffs and their class under the Railway Labor Act in its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.536" offset="1153546">And we sought and obtained a review by this Court on three questions that we urged that were involved, three points in which we stated that the courts below aired in the decision that they reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.571" offset="1249677">First of all, the Courts concluded, both the District Court and the per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals which was primarily a paraphrasing of the decision and reasoning of the District Court, the Courts concluded first that the amendment of the Railway Labor Act is so as to permit union shop agreements, which had previously been unlawful, was not a sufficient change in circumstances as to justify removing this injunctive prohibition against our negotiating such agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.931" offset="1415084">Then they also ruled that in view of the fact that the original decree of an injunction had been a consent decree rather than a decree written by the Court following a complete trial and litigation of the old suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.986" offset="1515290">Therefore, we must be deemed to have agreed with this original plaintiff's and their class that never at anytime in the future would we ever negotiate a union shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.432" offset="1581119">So the courts below both fell into the error that this Court come in to (Inaudible) Swift case of treating the consent decree as a contract rather than as a judicial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.866" offset="1642872">And third, both courts --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="386.758" stopTime="389.733">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="386.758" offset="1650395">(Inaudible) decree, there's a contract did you say?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_r_lyman" startTime="389.733" stopTime="504.803">
            <label>Mr. Richard R. Lyman</label>
            <text syncTime="389.733" offset="1662307">Yes Your Honor, and of course in the Swift case, this Court discussed that concept in considerable length.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.973" offset="1695222">And third, both of the courts below give such comments in their opinions to evidence submitted over the objections of the moving parties, the petitioners here that -- that we must consider that they give weight to it and -- and give it effect in refusing to modify injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.479" offset="1781321">That evidence was to the effect that as a result of an economic strike on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad in 1955, they remain a great deal of bitterness and hostility among the employees of the railroad and the evidence showed that these petitioner organizations had find and expelled members who worked during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.972" offset="1919248">The L &amp; M claim that 2500 of these employees stayed at work during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.198" offset="1944116">And now, they came in this proceeding to modify the old injunction to permit us and negotiate a union shop and urged that because there was this antipathy among the employee groups, which had nothing whatsoever to do with the original injunction against discrimination in the enjoinment of contract rights, had nothing whatever to do with this union shop agreement but was simply bitterness in strike out of -- between strikers and strike breakers that this should be construed as holding us without clean hands and hence not entitled to negotiate the union shop agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.644" offset="2201997">Oh, yes.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_r_lyman" startTime="529.973" stopTime="952.710">
            <label>Mr. Richard R. Lyman</label>
            <text syncTime="529.973" offset="2223313">Now, I think it's important to have in mind the nature of the discrimination that was charged in the original complaint, it illustrates that I have nothing to do with this so-called bitterness or hostility.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.207" offset="2300217">What these plaintiffs originally complaining about was the fact that the non-union employees they alleged had been -- had been denied equal opportunities for promotions from one category of employment to another, had been denied their fair share of overtime assignments, and had been denied certain attributes of their seniority status, all claim to be governed by the contracts between the company and the organization in certain matters such as picking man to be temporarily upgraded from helper to a temporary mechanics job or in assigning men to be called for overtime in particular jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.007" offset="2507421">There is discretion that's exercised by a local foreman and a local union committee in deciding who they think to be the best man to be upgraded.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.776" offset="2546500">And that was the gist of this original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.895" offset="2554964">There was no question of a union shop agreement back in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.466" offset="2585266">But this Court just prior of entry of this consent decree, had decided the landmark Steele and Tunstall cases which contained a complete and new to all of us exposition of the statutory fiduciary duty of bargaining agents and the carriers under the Railway Labor Act not to join in discriminating against members of the class representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.978" offset="2699264">Now up until the Steele and Tunstall cases were decided of course the -- as this Court knows from having reversed both the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, there was a quite a body of authority relied upon by many course to the affect that you couldn't maintain a lawsuit based on discrimination which was joined in by the company and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.572" offset="2833638">But, when these cases were decided, there was no longer any point in litigating this lawsuit on the original complaint for the purpose of trying to create any precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.031" offset="2903542">The precedent was there for us, this Courts opinion in the Steele and Tunstall cases practically wrote the form of our consent decree force.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.212" offset="2944188">But then when we came along after the Railroad Labor Act was amended as to permit a union shop agreement, the railroad suddenly said, "Do as, well, we won't sign that agreement with you because somebody is going to hold us some contempt of this old decree that says we can't discriminate based on non-membership in the union."</text>
            <text syncTime="729.662" offset="3022033">So, that's was this case is about and that's what precipitated this motion to modify the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.531" offset="3057455">Now, probably one of the most basic concepts on modification of injunctions is it in -- in injunction does not create a right but simply furnishes the protection, a remedy for the protection of a right which must find its source some place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.434" offset="3145122">In this case, the source of the right asserted in the original complaint was the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.321" offset="3168632">It was the statutory fiduciary duty defined by this Court in the Steele and Tunstall cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.245" offset="3212309">Now, our position to support of the modification and the injunction is quite simple, these rights stems from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.699" offset="3246164">The statute has now been amended so as to change the nature of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.083" offset="3271659">And if we don't have the injunction modified to conform to this change, we're confronted with the situation of these petitioners continuing under threat of this injunction, under panic contempt proceedings for violating it, continuing to be prohibited from negotiating agreements which Congress has said in these words, "They shall be permitted to negotiate."</text>
            <text syncTime="823.612" offset="3397778">And the original plaintiffs and the people that have been intervened in these more recent proceedings would be continued to be protected, would continue to have this injunctive remedy for the protection of a right which is no longer in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.088" offset="3479698">And of course aside from the inequity of being prohibited from engaging in con -- conduct which is lawful and which Congress said it is desirable now for national public policy in the railroad industry to prevent free riders to require employees to bear their fair share or the cost of burden -- the cost in the burden of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.564" offset="3585651">In addition to -- to just the inequity of being prohibited from doing something that you have a legal right to do, there is of course the additional very substantial financial consideration that's involved in which these petitioners are seeking the right to enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.057" offset="3671646">We have by railroads argument in this brief, I believe this claim that 2500 employees work during the strike and that everybody that work doing the strike was expelled from the union or was not a member of the union to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.634" offset="3729951">But we took a very small figure for the amount of dues income that would be lost by these organizations as a result of being kept under this injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.292" offset="3780524">I suspect a very conservative estimate what the dues lost would be if you would assume 1% of an employer's monthly earnings for -- for his monthly dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.320" offset="3832665">I suppose you have between $100,000 to $200,000 to this lawsuit dues to these group of petitioners so, this is not a situation where the petitioners are not suffering any particular inequity or in any particular wrong or not hurting from the continuously injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.078" offset="7059728">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.799" offset="7074565">At the outset, let me call the Court's attention to the fact that the release which counsel mentioned as being not sure whether it was in the record is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.867" offset="7122840">It begins at page 138 and continues through -- through page 144.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.949" offset="7163173">As you were allude to that release in a few moments from now, if I may proceed with what I deemed to be -- should be said first to this Court and an orderly presentation of the reasons the respondents have for affirmance of the decisions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.926" offset="7255124">In the first place, I think we should determine what requirements for modification of an injunction are, necessarily saw in order to determine whether the facts in this case bring us within permissive modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.769" offset="7334431">Well, of course the leading case on that subject is the case decided by this Court, the Swift case, and this Court has clearly said in the Swift decision that the requirement for modification is that there must be a clear showing of grievous wrong that must be shown by the movement evoked by new and unforeseen conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.785" offset="7466506">Secondly, we wished to point out that the courts have held at modification must effectuate and not what the purpose of the original decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.646" offset="7521991">In the next place, we desire to call the Court's attention to the fact that, as already mentioned, that modification under Rule 60 (b) is addressed to the sound legal discretion of the Court and is not to be disturbed except for an abuse of that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.803" offset="7606627">It is our position that in this case, the petitioners have failed to show any abuse of the discretion of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.279" offset="7644453">In order to point that out, I think we should briefly analyze what the District Court held when he denied the motion to modify the injunction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.780" offset="7698474">The District Court recognized his continuing authority to modify the injunctions not withstanding the consent nature of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.528" offset="7741524">He recognized that authority -- his authority continuing to modify under the formulae setup by this Court in the Swift case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.317" offset="7784678">The District Court concluded that the 1951 amendment, which is the sole reliance of petitioners in this case for modification for 1951 amendment to the Railway Labor Act which is Section 211 of that Act was permissive only and the District Court concluded that on the basis of this Court's decision in the Hanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.241" offset="7892302">Secondly, the District Court concluded that the Railway Labor Act leaves the railroad and the unions at liberty to agree that a union shop shall not prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.692" offset="7938173">He concluded that there was such an agreement in this case namely that a union shop should not prevail and that that agreement underlie the decree issued originally in this case.</text>
