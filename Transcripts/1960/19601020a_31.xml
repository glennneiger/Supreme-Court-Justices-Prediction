            <label>Mr. Harvey Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="16.832" offset="170715">Mr. Chief Justice, members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.088" offset="187747">This is a case concerning a seaman suing under the provisions of the Jones Act and for the unseaworthiness of the vessel upon which he was employed under the general maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.793" offset="242500">A jury trial was held and after the plaintiff's case was ended, a motion for a directed verdict was denied in informal language by the trial judge in saying “let's go ahead”.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.244" offset="300387">The motion for the directed verdict was again renewed at the end of the entire case, and it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.354" offset="328808">The decision was affirmed by the Sixth Circuit and of course, we are here on a petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.241" offset="364335">I don't believe there's any point in belaboring what must be well-known to all of us, and that is that, in cases of this type, when we are here to determine whether a district judge was correct in granting a directed verdict that the only question that should arise to that District Court Judge is whether or not there is a material issue of fact, upon which, the jury could have found in favor of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.354" offset="492753">All of the evidence, that is, both the plaintiff's and in this particular case, because the directed verdict was granted at the end of the entire case, also the defendant's evidence must be considered by the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.516" offset="541445">That evidence must also be considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiff and in addition, all inferences which may be reasonably drawn from that evidence must be considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.294" offset="616573">And so, the situation becomes a comparatively easy one, and that is whether or not, considering all the evidence in this case, there was a material issue of fact which should have caused the District Judge to submit this case to the jury for its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.478" offset="697240">There is no question but that this case concerned conflicting testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.345" offset="724720">I am not here to state that the plaintiff would have won his case had the case been submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.475" offset="753246">The only question here is whether or not it should have been submitted for the jury's consideration rather than the District Judge's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.837" offset="798699">Michalic was a fireman.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.495" offset="809357">He had worked for three years prior to the date of the accident for the very, very same shipping company.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.163" offset="839973">He had had Buerger's disease but for that three-year period, he claim that he was in good health, that he was able to work and in fact, some of the defendant's witnesses testified that his work was good, that he completed his work without any particular difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.067" offset="907682">In addition, testimony showed that the officers of the vessel knew that he had the Buerger's disease condition and that they employed him in spite of that fact evidently because, and certainly we could draw the inference that he was a good workman and able to do his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.010" offset="983437">The lay-up period had just started.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.371" offset="992841">This was a ship on the Great Lakes and as Your Honors well know, ships in the beginning of the winter season, that is the end of December, are laid up for the entire winter season to start their sailing again in the spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.802" offset="1046549">Michalic was a fireman and his area of duty was in the fire hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.749" offset="1070373">But during this lay-up period, he was ordered by his superior officer to go for the first time, he said, into the pumproom in order to help the pumpman do some work that was involved in the lay-up period.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.077" offset="1127633">He went into the pumproom.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.999" offset="1135365">He said that he was given a wrench, and I will go into the description of the wrench in a moment, a wrench and a mallet and was told what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.596" offset="1173713">The pumpman testified pointblank that he never showed Michalic how to do the work nor did he watch him do the work, but he told him about the casing.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.183" offset="1216136">The casing was the machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.248" offset="1224391">The particular pump covering that was to be taken off by Michalic loosening these 20 or so nuts from the casing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.937" offset="1271097">Michalic stated that he worked for about an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.337" offset="1288756">That the pumpman later came back or came back at that point from another job which he was doing and that Michalic told and complained to the pumpman about the condition of the mallet -- I'm sorry, about the condition of the wrench.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.800" offset="1338598">And the pumpman told him, "Never mind that.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.865" offset="1346853">Go ahead and complete the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.115" offset="1355839">Do the best you can," I believe were his exact words.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.697" offset="1370154">And Michalic did continue the job and finally completed the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.350" offset="1392724">At that point, the pumpman came out --</text>

            <text syncTime="361.599" offset="1549772">And now, all of this testimony on which you relied on raise the jury questions in the petitioner's testimony, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_goldstein" startTime="368.108" stopTime="590.356">
            <label>Mr. Harvey Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="368.108" offset="1575790">The petitioner's testimony and one witness by the petitioner, and I will get to that witness' testimony in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.570" offset="1605674">We believe that all of that descriptive testimony concerning the condition of the wrench was sufficient to permit a submission of the case to the jury for its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.328" offset="1656665">May I point out the similarity of the language used by the petitioner and by his witness to the language used in the Jacob case by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.702" offset="1698147">In the Jacob case, in which this Court stated that there was sufficient evidence to permit submission of the case to the jury, there is this language “Petitioner used an S-shaped end wrench of the proper size which was “well-worn,” had seen a lot of service, “was a loose fit,” had a lot of play on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.312" offset="1792606">“It was worn.”</text>
            <text syncTime="425.270" offset="1804413">The play at the end was about an inch.”</text>
            <text syncTime="428.727" offset="1818311">And I think that our language is very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.819" offset="1838686">In addition, there was a question of a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.498" offset="1857390">Michalic testified that in order to get down to the area of the pump he had to climb down from a catwalk which was at thwart ship, placed the thwart ship through the pumproom and “in between four beams which held this pump in order to stop it from vibrating and they work in an area of approximately six inches."</text>
            <text syncTime="457.918" offset="1935026">Other witnesses testified that it might have been as much as 16 inches, but in no case did any witness testify either less than 6 or more than 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.432" offset="1969089">In addition to that, the defendant put into evidence three exhibits showing the entire pumproom area and certainly, the particular pump itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.597" offset="2013811">The third question of course is whether or not there was sufficient instruction or, in fact, any instruction on the use of the method to be used by Michalic in taking the nuts off the casing and also whether or not there should've been supervision in asking a man, concededly inexperienced, to do work with special tools which he had never done before and in an area which he had never worked in before.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.273" offset="2128436">We state, and it is our belief, that the evidence is at least sufficient to have submitted this matter to the jury for its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.226" offset="2180263">The District Judge, in denying the case, stated simply that he had seen the area in which Michalic had to work from the pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.234" offset="2224358">And he stated, as the reason for his conclusion of fact, and I state that it was his conclusion of fact, that Michalic was, in fact, given a safe place to work was that “Well, the pumpman did similar work on another pump.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.008" offset="2271378">If he could've gotten to his pump, why couldn't Michalic get to his?"</text>
            <text syncTime="545.405" offset="2284962">Of course, there was no evidence in the record that the pumps were in the same or in any similar place in the pumproom itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.064" offset="2311607">This was simply a statement by a judge going completely outside the record to assume that two men were doing similar work when, in fact, there was no evidence of that type in the record itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.022" offset="2359463">As far as the question of instruction and supervision of Michalic, the judge said, the District Court Judge that is, said that this isn't necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.838" offset="2402722">He might not have been experienced, but experience isn't needed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.289" offset="2420485">Now, I submit that that question is, again, a question of fact which should have been submitted to the jury for its consideration and not by the District Court judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="771.182" offset="3188067">To continue, the witness involved was the second mate of the ship involved in this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.668" offset="3222026">He stated that he knew the pumproom area, that he knew the tools, and that they were battered and beaten as usual, they were old, and they were worn, and that they had been in that condition for sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.537" offset="3273540">Now, on the cross-examination, one of the first questions put to that witness was whether or not he was on the ship on the date of the accident itself and he stated that he had left the ship some-nine days before.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.225" offset="3320247">Because he was not on the ship on that particular day, all of his testimony was stricken, although there was quite obviously a presumption of continuation of condition in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, evidence which would show that there might have been a change in the condition of the various tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.983" offset="3387329">Now, it is our opinion that the rejection of that testimony, in it of itself, was sufficient to have caused -- to have called for a reversal in this particular case because that one witness who was of prime importance, being an officer of the vessel itself, and stating that he had knowledge of the tools and of the pumproom itself certainly should have been allowed to continue and testify in full concerning the conditions of the tools itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.262" offset="3500387">The fact that he had finished his direct testimony had no bearing on the subject because further testimony could have been brought out on cross-examination and certainly, further testimony could have been brought out on rebuttal or on redirect examination of the witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.771" offset="4746428">If there is to be a presumption of continuation of condition, the mere fact that he left the vessel nine days before could certainly not strike his testimony if there was, in fact, no evidence that there was any change in the condition of the tools or in the pumproom during that nine-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.912" offset="4823019">Certainly, his evidence was entitled to some way even though he was not on the vessel the very moment of the accident itself, and that weight should have gone to the jury for its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.504" offset="4865337">Now, my last point, it seemed evident or may I -- may I go back for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.803" offset="4906611">The complaint was framed with the use of the word "teeth" in the wrench -- in the description of the wrench in the -- in the sense that it was stated in the complaint that the teeth of the wrench were defective and that the grip of the wrench was defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.890" offset="4962931">The Circuit Court, in dismissing the case, referred time after time to the teeth of the wrench and saying that “the plaintiff has not proved his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.779" offset="5014444">He says that the teeth of the wrench are defective and we now find that there were no teeth in the wrench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.697" offset="5034193">He claims that the grip of the wrench was defective and we now find that there was no grip.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.227" offset="5064286">There was no question but that there were no teeth of the wrench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.399" offset="5076929">It was never asserted that there were any teeth on the wrench, except in the complaint itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.923" offset="5095111">There was a tremendous amount of pretrial preparation in the case and Mr. Ray, during the discussion of the argument of the opinion of the District Judge, conceded that he was not surprised in any way that there was no teeth on the wrench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.428" offset="5161044">In short, the entire case was predicated to an open-end wrench which did not have any teeth but were, in fact, used by the plaintiff, as we said, in a defective condition.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lucian Y. Ray</label>
            <text syncTime="1368.438" offset="5577122">Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.975" offset="5603244">The determination of the existence or nonexistence of negligence in a personal injury case, we suggest, Your Honors, involves, initially, the exercise of judicial judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.898" offset="5658937">The petitioner in this case is asking this Court to substitute his judgment in that particular for the judgment of the two courts, both of which considered that -- those questions very exhaustibly - the trial court in hearing the testimony, the Circuit Court in reading the record, and the Circuit Court filed, as this Court knows, having examine the record, a seven-page per curiam opinion in which nearly -- in which all, I would say after an examination of the record carefully, in which all of the testimony upon which the petitioner relies is set forth in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.623" offset="5833853">And the Circuit Court has said that, considering that testimony in its most favorable light to the petitioner, it found no evidence of negligence or unseaworthiness which was approximate cause of the man's accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.350" offset="5896756">Now, we agree with my friend here that the sole issue before this Court is whether the petitioner's testimony considered in his most favorable light presented the jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.930" offset="5951091">We say to Your Honors that it's not a question of the weighing of conflicting testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.417" offset="5969063">It's not a question of the balancing of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.758" offset="5978363">It's simply a question of taking his testimony and saying whether a jury question is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.908" offset="6006993">Before -- before adverting to the three faults which were alleged in the complaint, I'd like to bring these two facts to the attention of the Court so that the Court may understand the background of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.635" offset="6069896">This man had been not only a seaman for three years on the vessels owned by this respondent which were tankers, all of them are tankers, but he had had prior experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.021" offset="6123499">He was a fireman but the uncontradicted testimony in the trial court was that, during the lay-up -- lay-out -- the lay-up and fill-up of these vessels, it was part of the fireman's duties to work in the pumproom and to work on the pumps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.283" offset="6192462">So, he was not unpermitted with the task that he had and may I suggest to -- may I suggest to the Court that on the question of instruction, which apparently was an afterthought because it was not a charged fault in the complaint, lack of instruction, that he admitted -- he admitted that the -- in his testimony, you will find it on page 10 of the record, that the pumpman had instructed him how to remove these knots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.637" offset="6325896">And I say to this Court that whether the pumpman had instructed him or not, certainly, the putting of a wrench -- an open-faced wrench on these 20 nuts on the casing of a centrifugal pump, hitting them -- hitting the handle or the grip of that wrench with a mallet is a rather simple operation and wouldn't require instruction or supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.712" offset="6442193">Now, there are -- there are three faults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.480" offset="6453269">One was the allege lack of proper light, one, the alleged lack of proper space and the third, the alleged defective wrench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.885" offset="6498931">Now, I'd like to consider the testimony relative to the first two and consider the wrench last because, apparently, that's the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.583" offset="6537697">Now, there's a -- there's a rather substantial amount of testimony in the record with respect to the lighting situation, but it consisted principally of the wattage, the amount of the globes, how much wattage they had, the distance from the pump, and the deadlights, where they were located, whether the deadlights were clean or whether they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.884" offset="6638947">But the Court will find, upon examination of this record, that there is not iota of testimony in which this petitioner suggested that the light affected in any way his ability to do the job that he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.348" offset="6704776">And I ask him on cross examination whether he had any difficulty seeing those nuts and he said, “I did not have any difficulty,” and I say to Your Honors that, that -- on that issue, that laid that issue at rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.591" offset="6757752">There is no affirmative testimony on his part that he was having any difficulty because of the lighting situation and seeing the casing, the nuts, the mallet, and the wrench and he admitted affirmatively, in response to my question, that he had no difficulty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.256" offset="6912397">I asked him, “You had no difficulty seeing the bolts, did you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.353" offset="6924831">Answer, “No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.002" offset="6943431">Now, in respect to the lack of working space, here, again, there was a great deal of testimony relating to the measurements in the pumproom -- of the pumproom, the location of the bulkheads in the pumproom, the fact that there were pipes in the pumproom, and that there were girders in the pumproom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.042" offset="7023574">There was -- there was some testimony as to measurements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.035" offset="7039561">There is not one -- there is that kind of statistical testimony that there is not one iota of testimony in which it can even been be inferred that he was being hampered in any way in caring out this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.117" offset="7111868">And he was asked -- he was asked to explain how he did the job and he said he put -- he put the wrench on -- he put the wrench on the nuts and then he -- then, he hit the wrench with the mallet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.370" offset="7156903">And in answer to Justice Brennan's question, while it isn't entirely clear in the record, I think it can be assumed that it was done horizontally because if you'll examine the -- you'll examine the photographs that appear in the back of the record as to the -- as to the pumps and the casing, that's the only way it could be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.143" offset="13155976">This isn't a matter of simply saying, "Well, the wrench was all chewed up."</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.610" offset="13169768">He is specifically pointing to the open-end part of the wrench and saying that the wrench was all chewed up on the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.619" offset="13197876">There can be no other assumption in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.810" offset="13226611">Now, as to the question of instruction and supervision, the pumpman himself admittedly -- admitted that he -- that he showed him nothing about the wrench.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.650" offset="13278020">He told him nothing about the job itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.055" offset="13287633">I direct your attention to page 72 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.847" offset="13302784">Did you show -- question, “Did you show him the nuts he had to knock off?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.003" offset="13315427">Answer, “No, I told him the casing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.532" offset="13329533">There was only one pump there on that side, centrifugal pump.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.266" offset="13344475">“When that -- when that happened, did he have to leave the catwalk and get down to a lower level?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.664" offset="13362030">“Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.089" offset="13363702">“Did you watch him work?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.395" offset="13368926">“No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.197" offset="13372165">So that, there is specific testimony by the pumpman himself that he gave him neither instruction nor supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.431" offset="13413125">And certainly, if the -- as I know the Court will, when you read the District Court's decision -- opinion granting the directed verdict, you will see that the court itself stated that this man was given no instruction and then the court went on to say “Well, of course he didn't need instruction because it was such a simple job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.038" offset="13487522">Certainly, as to whether or not the job was simple enough when it had to be handled with special non-sparking tools, hit in such a way by an experienced man in an area that he claims he had never been in before in his entire life, was certainly a question for the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.824" offset="13582712">Then, on the question of safe place to work, as to whether or not the corridors were, in fact, too close, on page 22 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.681" offset="13650108">Question, “Was there any catwalk in the area of that pump you talked about?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.478" offset="13665259">“Yes, sir”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.877" offset="13666931">“Where was that located?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.909" offset="13671006">“It goes across the ship.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.533" offset="13677484">“But is it right over the casing or to the side?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.617" offset="13685844">“Halfway over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.353" offset="13688769">It is halfway over the casing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.131" offset="13695875">“Now, when you were taking the bolts and nuts off, how many of those nuts had you taken off at the time the wrench slipped?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.303" offset="13716564">“I had taken them all off but about five or six.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.874" offset="13726908">“You took those off without difficulty?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.627" offset="13733909">“I had a hard time loosening them off.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.016" offset="13743417">“But you got them off?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.987" offset="13747284">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.637" offset="13749896">“In other words, you put the wrench on them and tapped it with the mallet and loosen them, and then you turned the nuts off?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.741" offset="13770376">Answer, “I had a hard time taking them off.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.366" offset="13780825">Now, whether or not this man was talking about the tightness of the nuts or the closeness of the corridors is something that I cannot state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.090" offset="13815724">I look at the record and I say that, from this record, it could have easily been inferred that what he was talking about was the closeness of the corridors rather than the hardness of the nut, and I suggest that that, in it of itself, would be a submissible issue to the jury for its consideration and not the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.936" offset="13907153">Thank you, sir.</text>
