            <text syncTime="28.079" offset="215646">Now, I don't think that's a good argument because you have a local activity in Alaska and that local activity is not going to be repeated in any other State, so there's no harm in taxing this one local activity occurring in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.606" offset="277817">It makes no difference whether a different activity which occurs in Seattle is taxed or whether it isn't taxed.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.605" offset="561821">If a freezer ship lays outside of Alaska's taxing -- taxing jurisdiction and if it buys all of its fish from independent fishermen, then, I do not believe that freezer ships would be liable to any taxes, whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.262" offset="848436">So, if you can consider that the Ninth Court of Appeals as being the territorial Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, you at least have two opinions from that Court to go on.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.033" offset="2887555">I want to discuss three preliminary matters and then come very quickly at the question of the incidence of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.883" offset="2922872">The first and I think it's related to the function of this Court in dealing with the incidence is the statement that the respondents here have not paid or provided for payment of taxes accruing in the years -- tax years since this case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.416" offset="3009076">Chapter 71 of the Session Laws of Alaska of 1955 requires that a tax liability bond be filed by persons applying for other licenses to engage in any business in Alaska that the amount of the bond be twice the amount of the estimated tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.864" offset="3118791">And there is a further provision that the requirement for a bond maybe waived if the Attorney General finds that the applicant has property in Alaska subject to Alaska's jurisdiction in an amount sufficient to cover any estimated tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.006" offset="3203427">Not all of the respondents have operated in each of the years since 1954, but each of the respondents has complied with this Section which I now speak, by either posting a tax liability bond or obtaining a waiver under conditions approved by the Attorney General of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.359" offset="3304782">So, the Alaska is protected and likewise, the respondents are extended to the extent of 10 years of tax liability as I stand before this Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.257" offset="3424423">I do not have the bonds before me, Your Honor, but we made an effort to draft them in a form which would make their validity dependent upon the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.612" offset="3469772">And if there is any remand, I would assume that the litigation would not have terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.353" offset="3496835">Now, with respect to the statement that the respondents are Puget Sound canneries, that is not a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.191" offset="3524106">What the record does state is that the respondents can their fish in the State of Washington and that is all the record states.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.443" offset="3557125">But the fact is that their fish are their custom canned by which is meant that someone who owns and operates a cannery, cans fish for a custom canning charge, the property and ownership of the fish remaining in these respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.422" offset="3645106">Now, from the standpoint of the administration of Washington's tax laws, the respondents for whom these fish are canned and who retained the ownership are the canners.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.805" offset="3698604">And the taxes which they pay to the State of Washington are paid in respect of that canning.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.849" offset="3726817">I don't believe that this is an unusual construction of the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.642" offset="3745938">But where there is a reference to the canning of the fish by respondents, that is the circumstance in which they are canned by respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.817" offset="3782614">Finally, with reference to the question of the significance of the three-mile limit and the territorial waters, in its last opinion, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that it did not need to decide that issue in order to pass upon the validity of this tax under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.769" offset="3878431">I think that is a correct proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.018" offset="3895463">The Court assumed that the freezing and storage of fish by respondents was being carried on in territorial waters, tested the validity of the tax on that assumption and found that invalid under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.638" offset="3961919">Now, if that position is not sustained by this Court, then, the Court will come to a due process question, and that would require a determination of the extent of the territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.440" offset="4017089">But as the case is here now, there has been no such determination except that the District Court inferentially ruled that the normal three-mile limit was applicable in Bristol Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.641" offset="4069961">And in its first opinion, which has now been withdrawn, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals held that a headland-to-headland rule should be applied and it suggested the drawing of a line which I calculated to be approximately 50 miles in lake, from one side of Bristol Bay to the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.077" offset="4899715">We have said that if a state court as the tax is on -- on a -- uninterrupted sale from one State to another, the fact that a state court rather inclined to sustain a tax for appropriate reasons, if a state court find that a tax is indeed a burden on interstate commerce, that carries a lot of weight here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.645" offset="5074004">Now, here, what is being suggested, I think is inappropriate because a court of the State of Alaska would be the one to determine the construction of a statute of the territorial legislature of the territory of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.418" offset="5161044">And that some 10 years after its enactment and some 10 years after taxes which for all practical purposes at this moment had been paid by the respondents in the form of supersedeas bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.507" offset="5221439">But I hope to persuade the Court that under either of the two possible constructions and I think there are only two, that this kept tax cannot stand and that a remand would be a formal and useless as well as in this circumstance, an unfair thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.431" offset="5297089">Now, what is the subject or incidence of this tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.051" offset="5319555">It's the prosecution of a line of business, in this case, the operation of a freezer ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.859" offset="5350797">This is to be compared with the tax imposed on land-based coal storage plants and with the tax imposed on land based canneries and floating canneries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.674" offset="5402102">None of these statutes is made to depend upon the taking or catching of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.356" offset="5440763">The territory has admitted in its briefs in this Court -- excuse me, I should say Alaska has admitted that this is a tax on processing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.246" offset="5496351">So a tax on processing activity must tax process not fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.310" offset="5520593">The record is also clear that land-based coal storages who from 1949 to 1951 were taxed like the respondents in the same subsection of the same Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.548" offset="5581615">No differentiation, no specific reference to freezer ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.873" offset="5610872">Land-based coal storages operate no catcher boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.020" offset="5627486">They take no fish, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.635" offset="5637935">They purchase all their fish from independent fishermen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.903" offset="5654967">It's obvious that Alaska's tax scheme of which this Section is apart is to tax not the catching or the taking of fish but to tax the processing of the fish after they are taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.019" offset="5715466">The record at 305 and 306 and at 335 and 336 sets forth the fact that the land-based coal storage plants do not engage in fishing activities of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.658" offset="5785997">If this tax is laid on the catching of fish, then, the petitioner here has been collecting taxes without warrant from land-based coal storage companies for the 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.929" offset="5839078">Now, this record also shows that freezer ships can and do purchase fish from independent fishermen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.917" offset="5883068">For all that this record shows they could obtain all their fish in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.288" offset="5908564">Now, could a representative of the respondents come before this or any other court and say that they were not engaging in business as a freezer ship merely because they chose to conduct their business by not operating catcher boats.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.093" offset="10027760">Now, first and most obviously, all activities in interstate commerce take place within the boundaries of some State except as they may occur on the high seas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.550" offset="11001605">I -- I would attack that problem from this standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.374" offset="11024906">This Court has said that where you have local activity related to interstate commerce, you may tax the local activity but you may not buy the reach or measure of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.212" offset="11096168">Tax the interstate aspects and the amount of the tax may not be increased because of the interstate business done, Cooney versus Mountain States Telegraph Company was such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.952" offset="11195225">I think that this Court has also helped me with that problem in the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipeline case because it has said that a taxpayer has received benefits from the exercise of state police power and protection is not material to a -- a Commerce Clause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.589" offset="11305775">That is material to a -- an attack under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.017" offset="11327404">In the Pipeline case, the tax -- the taxing authority emphasized the conservation and proration measures which benefited the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.513" offset="11389471">This Court said that though the enforcement of these laws has been in the public interest and in the interest of the industry of which the taxpayer was a part, is only relevant to show that the essential requirements of due process have been met and it does not bear on the validity of the tax under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.815" offset="11490617">Now, in the Michigan-Wisconsin case, the holding of the Court was not that Michigan-Wisconsin was not engaged in local activities which might form the basis for a tax, but that the State had delayed the incidence of the tax beyond the point where local activity had seized and interstate activity had began.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.256" offset="11600436">In that case, Michigan-Wisconsin compressed, cool, scrub and dehydrated gas which had received from the outlet of a local gasoline plant and it transported it over its lines than into other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.026" offset="11675460">The case also involved a second taxpayer, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company whose activities were determined by this Court and by the parties to be identical from a constitutional standpoint to Michigan-Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.435" offset="11745155">Panhandle in fact made local sales within taxes of gas that it received in the manner which I've just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.448" offset="11789145">Now, here, as also in Michigan-Wisconsin, there is the possibility of a multiple burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.689" offset="11818088">There is not only the possibility in one sense, a multiple burden has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.520" offset="11849435">If Alaska may tax the storing and freezing of this salmon, then, certainly Washington may tax their cold storage because they are cold stored in Washington while they are awaiting discharge to be canned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.952" offset="11923205">And it was that possibility of a multiple burden which this Court also considered in the Michigan-Wisconsin case as an additional reason for invalidating the tax and in many other cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.660" offset="11986004">The power to tax a transaction forming an unbroken process of interstate commerce is in the Congress and not in the States or in a territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.075" offset="14171721">It says, "If all of the fish frozen aboard freezer ships or canned or processed in Alaska instead of the States, it would require a sizable industry to care for them aside from the fact that the territory would collect about twice the tax that the freezer ships are now paying."</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.221" offset="14256253">Now, this Court has at least twice considered legislation which had the same objective and the same effect as this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.925" offset="14299094">First, in the case of Foster-Fountain Packing Company versus Haydel, the facts of which I described a few minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.174" offset="14332113">In that case, Louisiana enacted a statute which prohibited the export of shrimp from which the heads and holes have not been removed from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.243" offset="14380387">But it permitted the export without restriction once the heads and holes have been removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.235" offset="14412361">This Court found that the purpose and intent of the Act was to preserve the business of processing Louisiana shrimp for Louisiana processors at the disadvantage of shrimp processing plants in Biloxi and it said that if the facts bear out, the allegations of the complaint and the affidavits, the case was before the Court on a demurrer, then, this case -- this Act cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.273" offset="14548511">A few years later in Toomer versus Witsell, it had before it Section 3414 of the then South Carolina Code by which South Carolina required that vessels taking shrimp within the waters of the State dock, unload, packed and stamped their catch before removing it from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.318" offset="14664600">This Court found that the necessary effect of that requirement would be to inhibit the free export of South Carolina shrimp to Georgia for processing in Georgia plants and that it invalidated that particular section of the South Carolina Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.879" offset="14746937">Now, at the same time, it validated a poundage tax of one-eighth of a cent per pound imposed on the taking of all shrimp in its waters by whomever taken and regardless of where it processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.733" offset="14818304">And of course, there can be no objection to such attacks but that is not the tax before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.575" offset="14845680">Now, the differentiation which the trial judge made, the distinction he made in not following these cases was that they were regulatory measures not tax measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.604" offset="14917778">And of course, this Court has on many, many occasions said that the tax power may not be used to accomplish of forbidden purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.845" offset="14958738">In Freeman versus Hewitt, it pointed out that a burden on interstate commerce is none the lighter and no less objectionable because it is imposed by a State under the taxing power rather than under manifestation of police power in the conventional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.421" offset="15029060">Alaska here is seeking to accomplish what this Court denied to South Carolina and to Louisiana by using the tax rather than the regulatory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.759" offset="15078379">And its action should receive the same treatment upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.684" offset="15098128">Now, with reference to whether or not the freezing of fish for later canning in Alaska is a substantial activity, there are three witnesses who speak of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.313" offset="15148596">Two of those witnesses were produced by the petitioner here and the fair essence of their testimony is that this occurs with regularity in Alaska under two circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.192" offset="15212126">It occurs first when fish suitable for canning but not for sale as fresh, frozen fish are received at the beginning of the season prior to the time the canneries go into operation, and it happens secondly when there is a large run of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.865" offset="15294882">And the canning facilities of the canneries are inadequate to handle the fish as they are received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.664" offset="15329991">Now, there is some testimony that this is an isolated thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.452" offset="15349217">There is no testimony from which the Court confine that it's 1% or 2% or 5% or any percent of the business of land-based cold storage plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.834" offset="15394670">But, in one sense, the activity of these respondents is isolated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.259" offset="15416404">Exhibit 17 in the record at page 57, we'll show by mathematical process that the share of the Alaska pack of salmon represented by the catch of all freezer ships, not just respondents amounts to exactly 1.3%.</text>
