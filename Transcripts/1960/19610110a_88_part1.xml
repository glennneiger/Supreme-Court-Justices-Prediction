            <text syncTime="19.988" offset="183359">Thomas Clancy, James Prindable and Donald Kastner were found guilty in the Eastern District of Illinois, willfully attempting to evade and defeat a tax imposed -- tax in violation of Section 7201 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.568" offset="289625">The tax that would -- of which they were found guilty of evading was the 10% excise tax imposed upon wagers received by persons who were engaged in the business in accepting wagers and they were all -- and Prindable and Clancy were also found guilty of willfully making false statements to Internal Revenue agents in violation of Section 1001 of Title 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.281" offset="420446">And petitioner Kastner was found not guilty of that charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.006" offset="475408">Now, the issues before this Court, as we see it, are whether the private books in the records of persons who are engaged in the wagering business may be seized and may be used in evidence against them to prove their guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.507" offset="561403">We say that we contend that this is a violation of their constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment and under the Fifth Amendment that the seizure under the Fourth Amendment was unreasonable and that their introduction into evidence to prove their guilt constituted a violation of their rights under the Fifth Amendment of compelling them to give testimony against themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.866" offset="654817">The second point is whether or not the statements prepared by Internal Revenue agents relevant to the subject matter of their testimony are required to be produced under the requirements of the Jencks Act after the witnesses -- after the agent witnesses have so -- have testified.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.661" offset="4549987">Now, each person accepting wagers in their behalf, this -- this Kastner, this employee also paid an additional tax and I believe that is what is indicated in the application where there is an "okay” alongside his name where they were required to list the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.634" offset="4613935">We -- we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.503" offset="4617383">That is what we are suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.066" offset="4627623">At any rate, these people were in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.099" offset="4643819">For four -- about four years, they filed these applications for registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.119" offset="4655835">And on December the 13th of 1956, during the same fiscal year, their -- their books were -- they -- an interview was conducted between Clancy and Internal Revenue Agents Mochel and Buescher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.339" offset="4704737">And at that time he told them that the North Sales Company had no principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.347" offset="4724799">He had no -- and he said that the address used on the tax return was his residence address, 2401 Ridge Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.328" offset="4756668">No objection was made by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.584" offset="4761684">They get -- anytime tell him that he couldn't do business in that manner that they should cease and desist from that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.670" offset="4786030">But they -- they gave them -- they issued the stamp pursuant to this same type of application, these at large registrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.698" offset="4826154">On the following day, these same agents interviewed the other two partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.815" offset="4846634">Now, subse -- they -- these -- these two interviews took place after the books of the partnership were audited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.891" offset="4874951">And after he's took, they interviewed them, they audited the books in connection with the payment of the 10% wagering tax and then they conducted these interviews in connection with this registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.824" offset="4914657">They asked him where they -- how they operated and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.589" offset="4937749">Now, subsequent to this audit and subsequent to these interviews, the petitioners received a letter from the District Director of Internal Revenue at Springfield, Illinois informing them that as a result of the recent examination that their returns would be accepted as final and that covered the period January of 1955 to December of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.230" offset="5044328">Then apparently in somewhere around March the 20th, we don't know the exact date, but from the affidavits of the search warrant, they were to conclude that somewhere in March of 1957, just a several months after this interview, these Internal Revenue agents began watching premises known as 2300 State Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.813" offset="5142653">Now, this was a four-unit building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.596" offset="5149759">We are concerned with the westerly one-half which consisted of a tavern on the first floor and an apartment upstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.992" offset="5183300">Now, in the affidavit for the search warrants, the Agent Johnson made the principle affidavit in which he incorporated by reference affidavits of seven other Internal Revenue agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.803" offset="5230634">And they concerned themselves principally without going into a great deal of detail, principally with activities concerning the acceptance and the placing of wagers on the first floor premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.223" offset="5280266">Now, somewhere around the 12th of April, one of the Internal Revenue agents saw Jim or Kim, apparently the reference is to Prindable, entered the side door of the tavern, go behind the bar and then go through a door that led upstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.513" offset="5341393">This was on the 12th of April of 1957 and he said that the man at that time was carrying a bag, similar to the bags furnished by banks to carry money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.456" offset="5385174">Then the next connection that we have would be upstairs second floor premises, concerns the fact that on May the 1st there were numerous agents but -- Internal Revenue agents both inside and outside this tavern and at about nine minutes after seven or five, if I remember correctly, Charles Kastner, the man who was listed on this return as being an employee of the North Sales Company arrived and went into the side door of the tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.342" offset="5496769">Now, a few minutes later, Internal Revenue agents found him, followed him in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.266" offset="5512443">There's nothing contained in the affidavit as to where he went and what happened to Kastner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.253" offset="5528430">But about eight or nine minutes later, James Prindable, the partner of the North Sales Company came and entered the same door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.421" offset="5561031">And by that time, there was an agent, an Internal Revenue agent inside that he saw him go behind the bar and he saw him go through this door in the northeast corner that led upstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.406" offset="5600946">That was principally upon the information, the connection of -- of these two people whom the Internal Revenue agents alleged in their affidavits to be well-known book makers and whose registrations, they say they examined the following day on May the 2nd of 1957 that they applied for a search warrant for the second floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.872" offset="5686836">There were two search warrants applied for by Agent Johnson, one for the first floor, for the tavern and a second one for the second floor premises, the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.192" offset="5724139">The search warrant was issued and I say to you and we say that that thing was shown by the Internal Revenue agents because the -- the full and complete facts were not presented to the issuing judge, the fact that this at large application have been filed by Prindable and the fact that Kastner had been listed on the return as an employee accepting wagers on behalf of the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.013" offset="5819434">If that fact have been -- have been given to the Court and the Court acting as a reasonably prudent man, but it come to the conclusion only that this was one of the places or this was a place at which the North Sales Company was accepting wagers on those particular days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.045" offset="5883591">With that information, the judge was not given the benefit of that information before the warrant was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.276" offset="5908459">And we say that if they had known this fact, the only possibility would be -- even if -- well, I think Mr. O'Connell -- excuse me, I won't go into that, Mr. O'Connell, I believe, would cover that point in his portion of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.504" offset="5957360">But then this -- the search warrant was issued to any special agent, Special Agent George Kienzler then took the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.553" offset="5997589">He went to 2300A State Street to the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.569" offset="6013680">When he arrived at the apartment armed with a search warrant, he was confronted by Donald Kastner, one of the partners of the North Sales Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.765" offset="6046386">And he asked Kastner what he was doing here and Kastner said he was waiting for one or more telephone calls and that it was North Sales Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.045" offset="6075538">And he asked him if he had a stamp and he said, "Well, the North Sales Company has a stamp but I don't have it but Tom takes of it," in reference to Tom Clancy and -- and of course, for a partnership, if there are more than one name, there are more -- the stamp is issued to a partnership, all names were placed on a one stamp and consequently, there is only one stamp and each partner does not get an individual stamp nor he doesn't pay any individual tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.406" offset="6180968">So, conceivably, all three partners couldn't have the same stamp at the same time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.071" offset="6287653">And these people operated and the record shows quite clearly that they operated at many places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.362" offset="6308864">Many places and they went from place to place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.886" offset="6318895">I -- I think it is quite obvious that if an individual engage in a wagering business complies with all of the requirements of the wagering act and he indicates a place in which he is going to do business, he will be very properly met by the local authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.349" offset="6388799">Consequently, these people filed at large applications and by the testimony of the Govern -- of two of the Government's witnesses, there was nothing wrong in conducting business in this manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1585.493" offset="6445328">They registered and these people also, if I might add, filed monthly reports of the amount of wagers received and they paid a 10% tax on the amount of -- of wager so reported.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.168" offset="6572074">We had some disagreement about that because on our theory of the case, the original acceptor of the debt is liable for the tax and if he lays off a portion of this to someone else, he, nonetheless, is responsible for the payment of the complete tax unless he meets certain requirements which none of these people did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.021" offset="6647411">And in our opinion, dim as now, these were layoffs and the initial acceptor was responsible for the payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.736" offset="6682311">So then, if I might say, this search warrant was then issued and it was authorized the seizure of the books, records, memoranda, tickets, pads, tablets and papers recording receipts of money and so forth and all of which are designed or intended to use and which have been used in the conduct of a wagering business, have been used in carrying on some wagering business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.002" offset="12615346">Whether there was a probable cause, whether if the answer to that question is yes, the seized property was properly seized as the instrumentalities of the crime for which there was alleged to be probable cause in the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.234" offset="12672293">And three, assuming those two questions are answered affirmatively, as we believe, whether there was anything wrong in the fact that the crime for which these people were convicted and for which this evidence was introduced was not the same crime alleged in the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.204" offset="12736240">That's the first question, which I proposed to discuss first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.298" offset="12748570">And the second question relates to the nonproduction on the court, as shown by the record, of the statements of three of the government witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.105" offset="13659826">If an income tax is filed giving us (Inaudible) giving items of income so on, then a search warrant he had set forth, if we have reason to believe that there's an invasion of the income tax in that the taxpayer did not save his income on past portfolio securities which we know are in his -- in his study in his house at 1000 Grand Riverview Avenue, what about that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="3429.878" stopTime="3718.967">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="3429.878" offset="13822934">I would rather doubt it, Mr. Justice, because this would turn on whether the securities involved were conceived to be the instrumentalities of committing the offense or merely the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.063" offset="13871626">And I would say that in that case, for all that was involved was the filing of a false return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.526" offset="13897435">In that case, the instrumentality used for committing the offense is the return itself and you could not, on the basis of a search warrant, obtain evidence to prove the falsity of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.967" offset="13947277">For that, I would like to emphasize is not, I think, the problem we have before us in this case because I like to come again -- return to the statute which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.872" offset="13986879">Now, Section 4412 which we have set forth at page 56 of our brief is the provision requiring registration and it states that each person required to pay a special tax under this subchapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.483" offset="14053334">And the special tax is referred to in the previous Section 4411 which is the special tax of $50 to be paid by each person who is liable for the 10% excise tax on wager.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.374" offset="14108818">4412 says that each person required to pay the special tax shall register with the appropriate official his name and place of residents and then if he is liable for tax under Subchapter A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.075" offset="14155630">In other words, if somebody is liable for a tax -- the excise tax on wagers, someone is engaged in the business of accepting wagers, he is to register each place of business where the activity which makes him liable is carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.569" offset="14225638">So that what we have in this statute is the registration requirement is not a general registration but to register and to register with certain specific information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.544" offset="14265553">And some of that informa -- one important element of information is that each place where this business is carried on be registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.231" offset="14300348">Now, in this case, the search warrant filed by the agent which had attached to it seven other search warrants of other Internal Revenue Service agents showed the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.973" offset="14355310">First, the Internal Revenue agent who is in charge of the collection division which had control of registrations under this statute for this area testified in his affidavit stated that there was no record of any registration for these particular premises, 2300A State Street, the second floor over the top and he so unequivocally stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.704" offset="14462203">So that from the point of view of the Internal Revenue agent and the District Judge, it was clear that there was no record of a registration for these premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.155" offset="14503999">Now, therefore, it seems to us the next question is, did the remaining affidavits give reasonable cause for belief that in fact a wagering operation was being conducted at this premise?</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.984" offset="14563349">And we submit that these affidavits did afford a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.769" offset="14586441">In addition to the material that's -- petitioners' counsel has referred to the Internal Revenue agent himself who made the primary affidavit stated that on one occasion, in addition of placing bets, he had seen a woman come in and give some -- give some -- some money to the bartender and the bartender went and placed it in a stairwell that led up to the second floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.505" offset="14681422">He waited a few minutes and then he said to the bartender, "I have some money coming from me," because he had previously placed a bet and won.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.908" offset="14707022">The bartender said, "Just a minute," and he went open the stairwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.471" offset="14725308">He took out an envelope with $9.60 and gave it to him in his winnings on a previous bet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.477" offset="14749236">In addition to that, there is an affidavit by another agent that he had interviewed certain well-known bookmakers in a town in the vicinity called Collinsville.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.691" offset="14794167">And these bookmakers testify -- stated they picked up wagers at a certain tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.819" offset="14818617">And there's further indication, further show that an examination of the telephone company records indicated that a number of telephone calls had been made from this tavern to the upstairs premises where the raid took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.827" offset="14890715">Now, we don't say that this established in fact that this crime had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.012" offset="14915375">That's not the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.127" offset="14919868">The standard is that probable cause was there -- a reasonable basis for the conclusion by the District Judge which he found in the search warrant that there was probable cause to believe that the premises were being used in violation of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4970.075" offset="19983653">Set forth at page 20 of the record, books, memoranda, tickets, pads, tablets, papers, recording of the receipt of money, receptacles in the nature of envelopes in which there is kept money won by patrons and diverse other tools, currency and records, all designed for the use in violating these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.823" offset="20086680">Now, this Court has repeatedly recognized that the instrumentalities used in committing an offense as distinct from mere evidence of that offense are properly subject to seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="5118.322" offset="20576632">These -- these provisions carried to -- read together as this Court has said in the Lewis case indicate that the $50 tax is a registration fee that must be paid before engaging in a business of wagering.</text>

            <text syncTime="5419.563" offset="21781608">And the final point which we have discussed in our brief and we think it's fully covered by the decisions of this Court is that once the original search and seizure were valid, the fact that the offenses for which the evidence was introduced are not the same offenses as those alleged in the search warrant is immaterial even that was specifically ruled by this Court in the (Inaudible) case which we have quoted in our brief at pages 40 to 42 and also recently in the (Inaudible) case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5496.310" offset="22088600">And we agree with the petitioners that this was an erroneous principle of law as we had previously explained to the Court last term in the Needleman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.288" offset="22128515">We think that if it is a report in writing signed by the agent, it is producible under the Jencks Act even though the fact that the agent who testified and made the report is a government witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.175" offset="22188074">However, our position is that although these rulings were erroneous in the case of one witness, the man named Minton, this was not prejudicial error.</text>

            <text syncTime="5623.775" offset="22598510">They were based -- his statement was based principally on what had been related to him by Mr. Mochel, one of the two agents, who, according to his information, had turned the documents over.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.975" offset="22643231">And Mr. Mochel stated in -- sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.963" offset="22655248">Mr. Raymour (ph) of the United States Attorney advised us that Mr. Mochel had told him that at the time he was on the stand, he had in his inside "pocket” folded carbon copies of these typed documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.457" offset="22713240">And on the basis of this information, we prepared our brief in the form that it was filed with this Court and sent a copy to the United States Attorney before filing and he approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.734" offset="22770291">I received the defendants -- petitioners' brief last Thursday.</text>
