            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Chanler, you may continue.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Chanler</label>
            <text syncTime="2.211" offset="112201">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.850" offset="126725">As I was pointing out just before the recess, one of my contentions is that a single contract whereby a single consumer arranges for the supply of its requirements of raw material over a period of years, cannot come within Section 3 of the Clayton Act because there is no basis for inferring under such a contract that the effect or purpose or use of the contract shall in any way be to limit competition or tend to create a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.440" offset="257128">It stands on a totally different footing than a contract tying up large section of actual retail or consuming market.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.621" offset="305821">The reason for that – it's perfectly true that large volume of coal is withdrawn from competition, I'll put it that way, and that, of course, is their point, but quantitative test alone is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.210" offset="376247">In the first place, you have to show that somehow it tends to join some connection with illegal method of limiting competition as Mr. Justice Brandeis stated long ago in Board of Trade v. Chicago quoted at page 19 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.207" offset="444165">Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade restraints from buying to restrain is of the very essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.656" offset="478020">Obviously, the contract to buy 225,000 or 2 million tons of coal a year has effect or preventing the purchaser from buying that coal from anybody else, or from many other sellers, for selling that coal to the purchaser but there's nothing illegal about that type of contract, if there was, every contract in which you buy a large volume of goods would be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.549" offset="565582">There must be some connection between the volume, the quantity and restraint in the competition and that in terms of the Clayton Act as hitherto construed by the courts and as intended by Congress occurs only in this type of contract when the effect is to tie up competition for the resale or the tying up of outlets of the sellers goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.895" offset="687000">Moreover, as Mr. Judge Frankfurter pointed out in Standard Oil, purely -- a purely quantitative measure of the effect of the contract is inadequate because the narrower the area of competition, the greater the competitive effect on the areas of competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.171" offset="756067">Since it is the preservation of competition which is at stake, the significant proportion is that of the area of effective competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.388" offset="796923">Now my friends, talk about the area of fixed competition as being in Florida and I say why, we're selling half the coal that's being burned in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.183" offset="844152">We may sell more than half the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.065" offset="851675">Well, that's because we're the first ones to burn fuel coal as a fuel in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.864" offset="878843">We are the newcomers in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.880" offset="886888">We are now contemplating building an atomic power plant in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.880" offset="906846">When that's built, we have 100% of the atomic power plant market for Florida, that won't be a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.004" offset="931401">We'll be introducing a new competitive fuel as -- a method of making electricity so that the fact that we have -- selling a large proportion of the coal being burned and sold in Florida is just prickly beside the point, what we've done is to open up, to the sellers' competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.155" offset="999946">The entire boiler fuel market and fuel market in general is the whole Peninsula of Florida which has to do with monopolizing entirely by oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.939" offset="1031084">The sellers' competitors can vote anybody who is buying oil and say "Look, we can bring coal in the way they're doing it in Tampa, will you deal with us," something that nobody that would thought of doing before, but the real market here is the market in which the competitors and their sellers and their competitive seller and their competitors market their coal and the market from which our competitors in Florida could buy their coal in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.583" offset="1141739">This contract shows -- is up in the -- the coal, it can be sold from coal mines located up in the head waters of Ohio river and the center or Eastern part of the country, and that market extends at least from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Coast if not beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.257" offset="1220420">Actually, this contract involves quantitatively 1%, less considerably less than 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.839" offset="1250722">Even if we had six units -- we only have three, all burning coal to maximum, it would involve much less than 1% of all the coal marketed by this seller, this respondent and its competitors in the area where they market -- from which they market coal, where they dig coal and which they sell it.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.412" offset="2268975">It just doesn't make sense even though the producer is trying to accuse himself, establish that monopoly, but it just doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.920" offset="2299068">As Judge White said in his dissent below, "I cannot consider a single contract with a single utility serving only 3% of the land area and 11% of the population of a single state as “substantially lessening competitions or tending to create a monopoly" and I think that disposes of that angle of my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.939" offset="2383078">Now, I'd like -- just one more point and I said, in none of the cases, none of the 19 cases that -- except one, the 20th case Boeing Company, I'll come to it in a moment, none of the prior cases before a year ago had a seller even attempting to get out of this contract on the ground that he had entered into a sale on the condition that the purchaser wouldn't deal with its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.805" offset="2498644">In other words, the seller had violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.896" offset="2514944">Every prior case, well, three quarters of them were cases brought by the Federal Trade Commission which tried to stop the seller from enforcing an exclusive dealing condition on the ground that the inclusive dealing condition violated the Act, tended to limit the competition and was unfair to the purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.447" offset="2589132">The whole purpose of the Act repeated over and over and the congressional record is that the purpose was to protect the little dealers throughout the country who weren't allowed to sell more than one brand of goods on there, in their stores by virtue of these requirements contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.437" offset="2657155">The act, as I have said, contains no provision outlawing contracts at all and as -- thrown a stone these recent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.240" offset="2696338">Kelley v. Kosuga was pointed out and many other cases, the Court will not impose in party provision outlawing contracts into a prohibitory or penal statue when Congress didn't put it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.647" offset="2753912">The only time you hold the contract unlawful because of a violation asserts contract is when such a statute is when the illegal act is inherent in the contract itself or when the seller, the wrong doer is trying to profit by his own wrong, for the wrong do -- as a seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.546" offset="2825592">He is trying a profit by his own wrong here by getting out of a legitimate contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.009" offset="2843460">If he was trying to enforce the contract and had violated the Act, we could prevent it from doing a pursuit with the Trade Commission perhaps.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.203" offset="4748204">But it is first essential, if I may respectfully say so, that we be clear as to the facts in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.745" offset="4794389">Mr. Chanler began by what was perhaps a slip of the tongue saying that this was a contract to supply part of the requirements of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.942" offset="4855097">I call the Court's attention to the complaint which appears in the record at page 5 in paragraph 8 and towards the middle of that paragraph the contractors proscribed as a contract providing for the sale and delivery to plaintiff, that is the petitioner in this Court, of all -- of all of the coal required by the plaintiff for the production of the electric energy at a new plant it was constructing near Tampa, Florida for a period of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.037" offset="5023535">Alright, what we are dealing with here is a 20-year requirements contract, that is to say a contract to supply petitioner here with all of the coal that it presently requires and thus found by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.607" offset="5129801">With all of the coal that is presently required and presently contemplated a full requirements contract and not only a full requirements contract but if the Court please a full requirements contract for the period of 20 years following the date of the first delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.527" offset="5233455">Now, let me be very specific about this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.510" offset="5253413">The contract provided, contemplated that the petitioner was going to build a new station, the Gannon Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.329" offset="5288730">At that time, the petitioner had two other stations at which it was generating electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.276" offset="5320495">Those two existing stations burned the oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.997" offset="5335333">It had no coal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.103" offset="5347767">It determined to build the Gannon station and entered into the contract which is here in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.383" offset="5380890">That contract provides that there will first be constructed two units in the Gannon Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.372" offset="5416835">That those two units would be coal burning units that their total requirements for 20 years following the date of first delivery would be supplied under this contract all of their requirements that if and when the petitioner constructed any additional units at this Gannon Station to burn coal and it had the theoretical choice anyway of deciding whether the additional units would burn coal or burn oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.124" offset="5567822">But if it decided within 10 years at any time within 10 years after this contract was executed to build an additional burn -- coal burning unit in the Gannon Station that that coil burning unit would automatically being covered by this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.473" offset="5661236">So then the requirements for any additional coal burning units at the Gannon Station would automatically be withdrawn from any possibility of competition by suppliers of coal and would come funder the preclusive provisions of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.506" offset="5757367">Now I remember, if the Court please, the petitioner has no other coal facility, no other coal burning facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.964" offset="5795192">It's only coal burning facilities are at the Gannon Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.715" offset="5814209">They are necessarily absolutely covered by these requirements contract for a period of 20 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.682" offset="9442095">Now, so that our point which I hope I'll have time to elaborate in a moment, if Your Honors please, with respect to the amounts engrossed by this contract is that this contract engrosses so much coal that its competitive effect is so great that whether you take the minority of the majority opinions of this Court or take any standards that anybody has ever referred to, this contract meets the qualifying clause of Section 3 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.611" offset="9589844">In the first place, if you take the amounts standing by themselves they are certainly substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.515" offset="9621400">They are huge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.019" offset="9627460">This contract engrosses a huge amount of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.214" offset="9644178">If you take the amount and compare it on any reasonable market basis, this contract is huge and embraces a large share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.996" offset="9703320">I am sorry to -- but perhaps I'd rather take time to comment upon Mr. Chanler's suggestion about what the market ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.100" offset="9747728">Mr. Chanler says that you ought to take us some market, the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.284" offset="9776462">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.906" offset="9783045">Because he says that Florida might draw upon producers, 700 of them according to this record who supply -- who supply in the area from the Rocky Mountain to the Atlantic Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.130" offset="9851904">As a matter of fact, those producers also sell coal in foreign countries but obviously, that is not the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.947" offset="9887117">The market is the consumer market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.557" offset="9901641">Let us take this kind of a situation quickly to illustrate the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.706" offset="9922226">Let's suppose that general motors came into the District of Columbia or in the New York City and made a contract in restrain of trade or a price fixing agreement in one of those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.346" offset="9988786">Now, what is the market?</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.000" offset="9995368">First thing we are lawyers doing antitrust basis and say, what is the market in the section of one case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.163" offset="10023999">Oh, the market is the District of Columbia or the market's New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.493" offset="10041344">The market certainly is -- is not every place in the world where General Motor sells cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.068" offset="10071646">If that was so General Motors could pick out the District of Columbia and monopolize that and Ford could monopolize some other place and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.478" offset="10109262">The market is the consuming market.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.519" offset="10793462">The law under Section 3 as announced by this Court is confined to that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.291" offset="10828570">Is it a not insignificant or not insubstantial amount?</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.156" offset="10848005">I merely wanted to go a little further in an attempt to impress upon the Court the fact that even if you measure this by a market standard, even if you measure it by Sherman Act standard which you shouldn't do, of course, under your decisions, this is an enormous contract that satisfies the qualifying clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.382" offset="10948942">Now, your question to me is whether the competitor -- whether a contract would still meet the qualifying clause if it were for a new commodity introduced into a particular community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.765" offset="11010382">I believe I state that forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.976" offset="11019264">That is precisely one of the considerations considered in the Standard Oil case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2753.763" offset="11118425">Mr. Chief Justice, the easiest thing in the world to do in many commercial situations as every lawyer knows is entered into requirements contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.969" offset="11167222">The requirements contracts makes everybody feel nice and secured, but what it does is to remove a whole area of our economy from competition pro tanto with the requirements contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.247" offset="11228348">Now let's take this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.712" offset="11238170">Here, we had not only a requirements contract, we got a requirements contract for 20 years, if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.193" offset="11272129">Now, the coal industry is a depressed industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.978" offset="11299297">The -- there are 700, according to petitioner's admission, producers of coal who are able and eager to supply this company with coal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.479" offset="11425311">It's on page 62 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.977" offset="11439313">Now, what does this contract mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.697" offset="11450180">This contract means that for 20 years these people have no look in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.217" offset="11476198">I suppose every utility company did that, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.752" offset="11498350">About a quarter, one quarter of the bituminous coal in this country is consumed by electric utilities companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.887" offset="11534921">They are principal buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.411" offset="11545057">If this Court ever gave its sanction to that kind of a deal, this kind of a preclusive contract, I need not to elaborate on what it would mean to the bituminous coal industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.194" offset="11596152">It would mean instead of having a lot of little coal producers who live by reason of orders from time to time from utility companies, you would necessary have a few big companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.763" offset="11662399">And those few big companies, if you please, would in effect be kept to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.975" offset="11695313">There are many ways of skinning a cat in economic relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.632" offset="11721853">A utility company does not have to buy a coal mine for example, to get it captive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.100" offset="13327757">I've noticed that myself, Mr. Justice, but Mr. Justice, I want to make my position perfectly clear on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.507" offset="13365373">Let's -- in terms of the law as it exists today, established by the cases of this Court, a full requirements contract is unlawful if and only if it made attempts substantially to restrain, create or tend to create a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.253" offset="13460355">To satisfy that so called qualifying clause, the cases in this Court say, in a Section 3 Clayton Act case, you look only to whether the contract involves a substantial or not insubstantial amount of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.171" offset="13524093">Now, that is the law of this Court as I understand it and I don't want to be misunderstood if I may say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.995" offset="13563382">I am not -- I -- I believe that's the law I believe in that as the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.147" offset="13583966">I'm saying merely that this contract in the circums in -- that this contract, this record goes far beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.283" offset="13628479">Now, I want to quickly to get to some other points from Mr. Chanler's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.789" offset="13658572">Mr. Chanler's state of four criteria here and I'm always surprise when I hear him say them because they're directly contrary to the rulings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.928" offset="13719071">First, he says that -- first he talked about coal and oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.683" offset="13746134">Coal is a separate line of commerce for purposes of the Clayton Act, for the purposes of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.911" offset="13771003">I've already covered this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.146" offset="13775914">It's covered by the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.988" offset="13787303">You cannot measure the extent of the engrossment of this contract by going to oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.061" offset="13823666">Indeed you couldn't -- couldn't even do it for purposes of the Sherman Act case much less to a particular kind of agreement that's here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.479" offset="13857311">Mr. Chanler likes to refer to cello -- to Cellophane whether -- it's DuPont case the Cellophane case, but it's very significant that even in Cellophane in which was a monopoly case if you please and in -- in which you market concept has to be search very carefully this Court said that you would not take -- you must not take into account for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.888" offset="13962951">You must not assume for its example that wood, coal -- that wood, cement and steal although they're all building materials, all constitute of market said that each one of them has sufficient distinctive characteristics so that you must define the market for each separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.082" offset="14047692">And in the General Motors case, the DuPont-General Motors case, this Court said that automobile paints and fabrics constitute separate and distinct lines of commerce, that was Section 7 of the Clayton Act and that you look to the peculiar characteristics and uses of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.196" offset="14128149">In Van Camp the -- where we have got that brief, what the point is, that certainly oil and coal here are not interchangeable in any sense, not even for Sherman Act purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.404" offset="14176946">And when you come to the very point prohibitions of Section 3, they are certainly distinct of lines of commerce, but I want to get Mr. Chanler's second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.576" offset="14225638">Mr. Chanler wants this Court to rule that this -- a contract does not violate Section 3 unless the seller has economic leverage sufficient to impose the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.581" offset="14293661">Now I thought that was all settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.406" offset="14304946">It's very interesting, Mr. Chanler in his principal brief here for the petitioner didn't mention Times-Picayune although we have briefed it below, it came rather toward only in his reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.963" offset="14359176">But in Times-picayune, this Court very, which was a Sherman Act case, this Court very carefully delineated the distinction in this respect between the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, and I want to quote Mr. Justice Black's opinion for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.572" offset="14433677">From the tying cases, perceptible pattern emerges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.860" offset="14450813">Under the Clayton Act if the seller enjoys a monopolistic position in the market for the tying product, or, and that is underlined in the opinion, or a substantial volume of commerce in the tied product is restrained, the arrangement violates the narrower standards of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.698" offset="14546213">But under the Sherman Act, both conditions must exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.905" offset="14570977">That is the statement of the law as it's been established and as it's been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.653" offset="14593964">Under the Sherman Act, dominance or monopoly power by the seller is quite unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.656" offset="14621968">The reason for that as pointed out in the Standard Oil is that Section 3 of the Sherman Act is -- of the Clayton Act, Section 3 of the Clayton Act is a highly particularized, specific prohibition against contracts that exclude a competitor or competitors of the seller from any line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.244" offset="14740355">Under the Sherman Act, all we look to is a general statement, general condemnation of contracts in restrain of trade and a general condemnation of contracts in restrain of trade must be viewed from the point-of-view of the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.556" offset="14821648">It maybe under the Sherman Act that the mere fact that the seller's dominance and the mere fact that a tying contract was entered into is enough per se to show that the contract was unreasonable, but you must show the purposes of the Sherman Act that contract was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.852" offset="14918823">For the Clayton Act, that is not so as was exhaustibly analyzed in Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.440" offset="14945155">For purposes of Section 3 of the Clayton Act, you must show only two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.402" offset="14968978">One, that what is involved is a contract on the condition understanding or with the effect of foreclosing a competitor or competitors of the oil, and number two, you must show only that the effect of the arrangement may be, may be substantial to restrain commerce or to tend to create a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.829" offset="15138670">So Mr. Chanler's point in affect that the seller must have economic dominance or economic leverage or no matter what choice of words he may select is completely in opposition to the holdings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.004" offset="15219440">Now let's get to the next one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.976" offset="15231248">Mr. Chanler says that this is the first case under Section 3 of the Clayton Act involving a single contract between a single consumer, a single buyer and a single seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.075" offset="15307630">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.746" offset="15314317">This Court has never had such case before it but it reminds me a bill of the distinction on the basis of the red-haired man with the squint on his left eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.657" offset="15366040">All the principles announced by this Court cover this case and as a matter of fact, all we need to do is to look at the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.606" offset="15405746">If the Court will kindly turn to page two of our brief, this grey brief, we have set forth the statute and I'm sure the Court is familiar with it but I want to call the attention of a few particulars in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.781" offset="15486516">It should be unlawful for any person to lease or make a sale or contract for sale or use consumption or a resale on the condition agreement or understanding that the lessee or purchaser, note the single bearer shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, commodities etcetera of a competitor or competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.418" offset="15605008">In this, there's no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.178" offset="15620054">But that that language includes a single contract was intended to include a single contract and if anyone chooses to enter the maze of legislative history here despite the Court's -- this Court's admonition of the contrary in the Standard Fashions case, I am sure he must conclude that the Congress intended to reach a contract in a town as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out in the Standard Oil and as is shown in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.863" offset="15778774">In the good year of 1914, good in some respects, the Congress was very much concerned about antitrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.869" offset="15822869">It was very much concerned about monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.118" offset="15835826">It was very much dissatisfied with what had happened under the Sherman Act and Section 3 along with the other particular Sections of the Clayton Act were written for the purpose of catching up these situations in their incipiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.734" offset="15910327">I, myself don't see how anybody can read the legislative history of the Clayton Act without being bewildered in particular by being -- being certain in general that the Congress intended to leave no loopholes not to write.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.359" offset="15984828">Congress did not write Section 3 for the purpose of providing an escape on the basis of a single contract with a -- between a single buyer and a seller, but that it intended to cover all such contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.564" offset="16053582">Let me take this for as an illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.549" offset="16069569">Let's suppose Mr. Chanler in his remarks I believe before lunch referred to Sears Roebuck and A&amp;P.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.281" offset="16108544">Now let's take that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.366" offset="16116799">Let us suppose, if you please, that Sears Roebuck, one enterprise, a largest retailer by far in this country, let us suppose that Sears Roebuck entered into a contract with a single textile company for all of the white goods as they call in that business, cover sheets and so on, all that Sears Roebuck needed and entered into that contract for a 20-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.708" offset="16246157">Now the textile industry is in a bad way too and there'd be thousands of textile producers, hundreds of them I should say, who would be excluded for any chance at Sears Roebucks business for 20 years but that's a contract, a single contract if you please, a -- between a single seller and a single buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.912" offset="16334973">Can there be any doubt that that would be prohibited by Section 3 or let's take Du Point General Motors and if I may, let -- if I'll ask you to assume for me the absence of any stab (ph) connection between them from any ownership or start between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.299" offset="16408534">And let us suppose that general -- that Du Point and General Motors entered into a contract for automobile fabrics and paint for 20 years which would preclude all competitors who might want to sell automobile fabrics and paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.259" offset="16476453">Can there be any doubt that that would be caught by the provisions of Section 3?</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.852" offset="16522742">So I say that number one, this Court has precluded the argument that any dominance by the seller is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.395" offset="16568926">Number two, that this -- that the statute in all reason show that a sing -- that it makes no difference whether we're dealing with a single contract or many contracts, a single buyer or many buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.216" offset="16628276">The important -- two important questions are - first, is this a requirements contract in the sense that it excludes a competitor, a competitor or competitors of the seller and second, does it have a prescribed effect on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.225" offset="16728273">Now finally and I will quit --</text>

            <text syncTime="4166.944" offset="16771114">I would not think so Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.617" offset="16785847">In actual practice, of course we try to avoid the requirements contracts in the sense that the -- we -- the law as I have understood it has always meant that you've got to leave room for competition to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.444" offset="16849168">And for example, even if we have -- even if we want to get somebody to build a new plant to supply something for us, we take care of the financial requirements there by an agreement to amortize the cost to the plant but we will not enter into a requirements contract because the requirements contract is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.799" offset="16934536">Now I don't believe that that -- that the lack of necessity of the requirements contract means that they should all be outlawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.871" offset="16974869">It is possible that there are requirements contracts which do not run afoul of the qualifying clause that is to say that in the sense that they are not so large in the particular circumstances as to meet the standards of the qualifying clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.837" offset="17058670">On the whole, I would say that requirements contracts are an instrument and by their nature are suspect under the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.259" offset="17116453">May I suggest this, Mr. Justice?</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.930" offset="17127111">I know that this Court has said -- has said some harsh things about tying agreements in which a patented product is tied in with an unpatented and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.286" offset="17176534">A requirements contract actually may have and generally does have a much more serious effect on competition than the typical tying contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.132" offset="17219897">Let's take for example, International Salt or let's take the Signaled Steel which is Court of Appeals case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.447" offset="17257200">It's always possible in a tying situation for a -- for the dealer, the licensee to get another machine from somebody else or I don't say it's always possible but sometimes possible, get a machine from somebody else and get out of the tying contract that way and then use a competitor's supplies for -- for the competitor's machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.023" offset="17351450">But a requirements contract is total complete and absolute that no -- there's no way of getting out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.733" offset="17378304">You can't turn through a competitor but -- so I wanted -- want just one sum up on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.069" offset="17411636">Number one, I think the requirements contracts as a generality are -- have to be highly restrictive on the trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="4887.769" offset="19654405">The question we are concerned with here is not whether somebody can call it as a requirements contract because we have agreed to purchase a part and that's not a slip of the tongue, I mean a part of our fuel requirements from one seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.178" offset="19712084">The question is whether this is a contract to sell coal on the condition that the purchaser shall not use or deal in the goods of the seller's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.442" offset="19785122">Now Mr. Fortas said “Oh but we're not actually buying coal from anybody else.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.234" offset="19808319">He admits the contract permits us to buy coal when Peabody Coal Company made us a written offer to sell us coal to burn in our other plants if the oil company hasn't reduced their price, we deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.091" offset="19871744">We were dealing with the seller's competitors when we were negotiating with Peabody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.846" offset="19894732">You cannot convert this contract into a contract upon the condition that the purchaser will not deal and goes to the seller's competitors by saying that it still happens for economic reasons that we haven't availed ourselves of our legal right to do so whenever any coal company comes and offers us coal at a competitive price with oil, we are free to deal with them, we intend to deal with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.100" offset="20003819">Now this word requirements contracts with all due respect isn't even mentioned as far as I know in any case by the Standard Oil case and it isn't mentioned as far as I'm aware anywhere in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.988" offset="20063274">They don't know about exclusive dealing contracts, contracts based upon the condition imposed on the purchaser that he would not deal with the seller's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.808" offset="20114578">The word requirements contract were viewed first in standard because their -- that contract, that exclusive dealing contract, that contract based on the condition that the filling stations in those filling stations wouldn't deal with the seller's competitors was passed in terms of requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.619" offset="20197857">Contract said filling station X will buy all its gasoline requirements from Standard and Standard will fulfill all his gasoline requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.488" offset="20249370">But the purpose and effect of that contract was exactly the same as the kind that the Act was directed at and that Congress was intended to attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.125" offset="20287822">It was as if they said nobody can sell Standard gas in any filling station anywhere in the country if they sell anybody else's gas in that station.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.188" offset="20328155">That's why it was Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.326" offset="20336724">The requirements contract violated both the intent of Congress and the letter and spirit of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.288" offset="20364518">The contract that we have here has none of that thing whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.936" offset="20387088">It is simply a contract whereby a consumer purchases his raw requirements that he needs in his business in order to enable him first to justify the capital expenditure of building a coal burning plant which will take 20 years to amortize and to fulfill his public utility duties of producing power at the cheapest rate and having continuity over the years so that he won't have to be changing his rate all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.521" offset="20513416">As Your Honor, Justice Harlan pointed out in Mobile -- United Gas v. Mobile, 350 US 332 in page 48 of my brief, conversion by consumers particularly industrial users to the use there of natural gas may frequently require substantial investments which the consumer and thus will be unwilling to make without long-term commitments from the distributor and the distributor can hardly make such commitments if it's supply contract (Inaudible) chain because that was the Clayton Act case but the economic proposition laid down there is exactly the same one we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.676" offset="20674121">We couldn't have built this plant and brought coal in, in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.388" offset="20692929">Now I would like also to point out on this question of the market because Your Honor, Chief Justice, put your finger right on it when you talked about the situation of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.081" offset="20755728">If a utility company in California, large or small suddenly decided that it could be economical to bring coal into California so they start a coal burning utility plant in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.228" offset="20808286">It would have a monopoly according to them because it would be burning all the coal being burned at least for boiler fuel in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.437" offset="20841096">It would of course be absurd to measure the market that was said to be embraced by the contract of supply, whatever contract they made on the basis of that use to coal as a new comer in the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.766" offset="20902431">I might add of course Your Honor, regularly doesn't visualize that it would be very improvident probably the California Utility Commission for vehicle, a utility company to go into expense building a large electricity light producing plants in California that was going to burn oil unless they had a good contract, a long-term contract to supply if they're going to burn coal that would supply coal long enough to make it economically feasible for them to have a coal plant there because that's what the Federal Power Commission made them do in burning gas in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.183" offset="21056136">They can't bring gas into Florida with the great expense of building a pipeline unless they have a 20-year requirements contract to make it economically feasible.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_chanler" startTime="5294.153" stopTime="5678.994">
            <label>Mr. William C. Chanler</label>
            <text syncTime="5294.153" offset="21279953">Oh yes, the contract was made in 1956 and the plant was completed in 1958 -- 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.455" offset="21309210">I think that's all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.394" offset="21312972">And in regard to the record, Mr. Justice Harlan, there are quite complete affidavits on which these motions were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.048" offset="21351528">It's set forth all pertinent facts as to why the contract was made, the circumstances under which it was made and everything I think which are found in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.422" offset="21369083">The facts to a statement of the court below are quite specific as to the economic purposes and so called.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.778" offset="21402520">Now Mr. Fortas has stated that this Court, well his argument has been all the time that all you have to show assuming that you -- he can show, and I don think he can that this is a condition -- a contract on the condition, that the seller won't buy or won't deal from the goods of the seller's competitors assuming that he causes that hurdle, that all he has to show is that the amount involved is large in terms of quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.878" offset="21542849">And I would like to remind Your Honors that in the Standard Oil case, Justice Frankfurter stated in so many words, a purely quantitative measure of the effect of the contract is inadequate because the narrower the area of competition, the greater the comparative effect on the area's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.488" offset="21617351">This question of quantity they talk about even if it were reasonable to talk about to coal of a single really small size utility as an enormous quantity of itself doesn't prove anything here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.369" offset="21668864">It certainly doesn't prove that we come within main clause of the contract as the court below felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.866" offset="21690807">The court below felt said this was a contract in violation of the main clause of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.807" offset="21710555">In other words, the contract not to deal with the seller's competitors because it embraced a huge amount of coal, but you can't say that its contract not to deal with the seller's competitors because the amount involved is large and has nothing to do with it under the court below decision if that were the law and if that should be affirmed, every contract for large volume of goods, even the fixed amount of goods would be void and illegal it seems to me because it would engross that he keeps saying an enormous volume of coal or an enormous volume of commerce that has nothing to do with limiting competition within the framework of what Congress had in mind when this act was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.299" offset="21904593">In regard to leverage, while it's true that in Times-Picayune Your Honor, Justice Clark pointed out that as been previously pointed out in Standard in a Section 3 case, assuming that you had a contract that came within the Clayton Act at all and we're talking only about the qualifying clause then the test of whether or not it came within the qualifying clause could be either that the seller had dominance in the market because if he was a large dominant figure in the market, then if he had tying contracts or exclusive dealing requirements contracts, it could be assumed that he was building up his monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5499.068" offset="22099675">And as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in Standard and Your Honor picked up Picayune -- Times-Picayune, if you got to take net requirements contract, even though there isn't dominance for the purposes of the requirements clause, it's sufficient to show a substantial portion of the market, but that's not the leverage I've been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.138" offset="22195911">The leverage that is necessary in any Clayton Act case whether tying or requirements is the one referred to by Mr. Justice Black in the (Inaudible) case and the one referred to by Mr. Justice Frankfurter later in commenting on the -- the -- the Standard Oil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.348" offset="22296743">In Standard Oil, we recognize the discrepancy of bargaining power between the buyer and seller and pointed out that the retailers might still insist on exclusive contracts if they wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.580" offset="22337703">The leverage I'm talking about here and that Mr. Justice Frankfurter was talking about is the leverage that enables a seller to impose a restrictive condition on then buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.833" offset="22382738">If there isn't that leverage, you don't come in the Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5574.020" offset="22399457">Even though there is that leverage and therefore you come within the act, you still have to come to the qualifying clause and there, there is this question of whether you have to show dominance or not to come within the qualifying clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.050" offset="22451597">You can't prove you come within the principle clause by proving over talking about cases dealings with the qualifying clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.795" offset="22478555">And I submit that if Your Honors come to read the briefs, I pointed this out in some detail in my reply brief, I think you will find that everyone of the arguments, that Mr. Fortas has made, well the ones he's made here today and the ones that he makes in his brief, attempts to bring this contract within the act on various grounds that quantity is enormous or that you don't need leverage or whatever other arguments he has made are taken from quotations and opinions of this Court dealing solely with the qualifying clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.627" offset="22617840">The fact is that every case that's been here, all you ever talked about is the qualifying clause and your opinion started by saying so because there, there was a plain restrictive exclusive dealings condition at the beginning in Standard Oil contracts against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.347" offset="22680743">If it wasn't for the qualifying clause, this contract would obviously be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.688" offset="22702164">Here the question is, is the contract unlawful at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.728" offset="22714284">And I say you can't prove the contract is unlawful in the sense that it has an inclusive dealing condition that quoting decisions and opinions of this Court that deals solely with the question of whether being a contract based on inclusive dealing condition and also that the effect of lessening competition or tending to create a monopoly.</text>
