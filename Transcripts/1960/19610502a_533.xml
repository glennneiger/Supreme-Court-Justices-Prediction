            <label>Mr. William H. Orrick, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.731" offset="138324">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.358" offset="172805">In this case, the respondent's attempt to establish a principle which could subject the United States to an enormous liability, this principle is based on the theory that the insurer of a mortgage who has appraised for insurance purposes the property constituting the security for the mortgage, is liable to a purchaser of that property, unknown at the time of the appraisal, for the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.558" offset="301641">The cases here on writ of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit, which is in effect to establish that principle by affirming the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.310" offset="340616">Now, the facts in the case are simply stated under the -- to take advantage of the National Housing Act, one who intends to sell a house that is eligible for FHA mortgage insurance, they generally do some work quickly, if he knows the amount for which the FHA would appraise his house in the maximum amount, up to which, it will insure any mortgage on the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.695" offset="458167">To obtain this information, he must have a financial institution approved by the FHA as a mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.059" offset="495574">Make an application to the FHA for a so-called, "conditional commitment."</text>
            <text syncTime="104.893" offset="522951">When the FHA receives such an application, it sends an appraiser to appraise the property to determine whether it meets the standards of eligibility and to fix evaluation for insurance purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.230" offset="584286">If the property is found eligible, the Commissioner in this so-called, conditional commitment, to insure mortgage on the house, is bound to insure it an amount computed on the appraised value of the property, subject to the condition that the mortgagor when he comes along is found financially able to carry the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.168" offset="688044">Now, upon issuing the conditional commitment to a proposed mortgagee, the Commissioner also issues a separate document entitled, Statement of FHA Appraisal, which sets forth the written -- the appraised value of the property as determined by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.279" offset="760456">And under the statute, the seller is bound to deliver a copy of this appraisal to the buyer prior to the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.879" offset="798908">In the case at bar, Colonel Almquist in March of 1957, followed the procedure I have mentioned above and had an approved institution, make application for a conditional commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.440" offset="861184">In following the procedure, an appraiser was sent out to his house, by some time prior to March 14th of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.399" offset="904965">Now, on March 14th, Mr. Stanley Neustadt, the respondent here, the plaintiff below, was a Washington lawyer, was looking for a house and he and his wife looked at Colonel Almquist's house, after the appraiser had made his inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.250" offset="984377">Mr. Neustadt, the -- the house suited Mr. and Mrs. Neustadt and they considered the possibility of hiring someone to inspect the house, but it was his understanding that the FHA appraisal would disclose any matters of structural defects or matters as to which he had any concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.339" offset="1072776">He was informed as to that, by his real estate agent and that was his understanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.946" offset="1283114">The -- Mr. Neustadt then made an offer on this house for the sum of $24,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.204" offset="1324178">The offer was conditioned, expressly conditioned on receiving an appraisal in that same amount, an FHA appraisal of $24,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.102" offset="1371826">The appraiser who had been out there and now made his report and he reported that the house was worth only $22,750.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.889" offset="1430967">So the condition of the contract was not met and this backed the fact that the house was appraised and a lower figure caused Mr. Neustadt -- that he testified grave concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.654" offset="1486033">He then satisfied himself that the reason the house was appraised at a lesser value was not because there was no structural defect in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.665" offset="1530023">That was his major concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.382" offset="1536920">He was relying in short on that appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.439" offset="1557086">Now, having the information that the house is appraised for $22,750, he then made another offer in a contract dated April 9th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.310" offset="1620616">And this time, the offer was conditioned upon receiving an appraisal for the property at $22,750.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.013" offset="1659382">The condition was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.761" offset="1670457">The -- the closing and the -- and the transaction took place on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.188" offset="1696162">He moved into the property on July 10th and on July 11th, he noted some -- the house began to settle, cracks began to appear in the plaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.965" offset="1751228">He had the damage investigated by drilling a hole in the -- through the cement floor in the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.525" offset="1785501">It was discovered that some water had collected under there.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.446" offset="1801174">And he then -- six months later, brought the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.836" offset="1830745">Now, the position of the United States is first that there is no duty running from the FHA to an unknown purchaser of the property to appraise that separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.787" offset="1898559">Second, that even if such a duty is found that the United States is not liable for negligent misrepresentation which is the essence of this case whether -- and third that the term misrepresentation as it is set forth in the Federal Tort Claims Act and is the section from which the United States excludes itself form liability for then the torts set forth in Section 2880 (h) of that Act includes negligent misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.665" offset="2086013">And on this point, I am not going to take the time of the Court to argue because on eight different occasions, in six different circuits, including the Fourth Circuit in the case at bar, it has been held unanimously each time that the word misrepresentation included in Section 2680 (h) of the statute means and includes negligent misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.625" offset="2213909">But if the Court please, I would like to consider our second point very briefly which is that the gravamen of this action is the communication by an agent of the Federal Government to the -- Mr. Neustadt of a fact upon which he relied, which turned out to be untrue, namely that this house which he purchased had -- contains structural defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.735" offset="2366360">Mr. Neustadt in his complaint which is reprinted in the printed record on page 2 in paragraph 6, states that he relied upon that provision of the contract of sale that the -- any defect in the property would be disclosed in the appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.459" offset="2473253">He testified and his testimony is contained on page 15 that he understood the FHA appraisal would disclose matters of the kind about which he had any concern, so he wouldn't have to hire an expert to look at the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.691" offset="2562173">He testified that on page 17 of the printed record that he established to his satisfaction that the lower appraisal did not and could not in fact represent the difference in an appraisal -- represent the existence of a defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.111" offset="2643780">And on page 18, he testified that once he and his wife were convinced that the appraisal did not indicate any unsoundness in the home, he made another offer for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.448" offset="2709191">Now, this was the -- a communication made to him through this appraisal, which as it turned out, was erroneous and upon which he relied to purchase this property and it was this communication that's the very essence of the common law tort of misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.861" offset="2814830">Mr. Neustadt also wrote a letter to the FHA which is in the record on file before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.766" offset="2854431">It's not reprinted in the record, but stating in effect that he -- the same terms of reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.332" offset="2900720">Now, the position of the respondents with which we take issue, is that the appraisers, they're not -- they say they're complaining that the appraiser's negligence resulted in the issuance of mortgage insurance and consequently, in their purchase of a defective structure and that it was the availability of this insurance and not the receipt of the appraisal report, which in -- in effect that caused them to purchase the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.417" offset="3041050">And it's our position that this house -- that that is simply begging the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.591" offset="3069785">It's an -- an attempt to escape this misrepresent -- an attempt to escape liability on the ground that there was no communication to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.149" offset="3143973">Once the house was appraised at $22,750, all the parties concerned knew what the FHA would -- the amount for which it would insure the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.056" offset="3207607">And thus of the time this contract was complete, the damage had in effect be done -- been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.238" offset="3244283">The only way that Mr. Neustadt could then have gotten out of his bargain was if he were deemed a poor credit risk, not if he were -- if the house were found to be structurally defective.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.545" offset="3685543">Now, the purpose of the Congress in making that condition was to put the purchaser on an equal footing with the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.038" offset="3759522">The seller already had that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.902" offset="3771016">And it was not as -- has been claimed to make the United States liable to the purchaser for the amount of the difference between the amount of the appraisal and his purchase price.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence J. Latto</label>
            <text syncTime="1902.480" offset="7713311">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.769" offset="7726477">As Mr. Orrick has pointed out, there are three issues in this case, two of which I think it's fair to say or not of the con which ordinarily reached this Court, when it's the ordinary question of whether there was a duty of care, whether there's an action and negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.895" offset="7782902">Another is what is the nature of this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.749" offset="7794395">We assert that it is the common law action of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.323" offset="7804635">The Government asserts that it's a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.949" offset="7823130">The third question as the one just averted to and that is I think an important question of interpretation of a provision of the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.334" offset="7864717">Does the exception for misrepresentation in 28 U.S.C. 2680 (h) cover deliberate misrepresentation or does it include negligent misrepresentation as well?</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.710" offset="7918216">I should point out briefly in respond to Justice Frankfurter's question that the common element of all of the torts accepted in 2680 (h) is deliberateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.648" offset="7961997">There's no element of conscious false in assault and in libel and in slander and then the other torts included in that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.822" offset="7990627">But there is a common element of deliberateness and I hope to return to this question at the latter part of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.041" offset="8015496">I would like to return to the question raised by Justice Whittaker and Justice Frankfurter and that is the question whether there was a duty of care owed to these respondents by the Government, in connection with the inspection and appraisal functions under the National Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.555" offset="8097625">We are in agreement with the Government that the purpose or the purposes of the National Housing Act in -- in particular of these functions under the National Housing Act, is a matter of critical importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.324" offset="8148720">We don't think it is the only relevant factor, but certainly it is one that's entitled to very great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.975" offset="8171290">And Mr. Orrick said in the course of his argument that this -- there was a secondary purpose to protect the prospective purchaser of a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.233" offset="8212355">My difficulty with the argument is that Congress said otherwise and said so quite unmistakably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.294" offset="8244537">Now, I go back to the initial enactment of the National Housing Act when this procedure for inspection and appraisal was first instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.121" offset="8295842">And in the very first report of the Federal Housing Administration, it was explained that the existence of this function provided a purchaser of a home with the benefit which was not available to the purchaser of a home which would be financed through a conventional mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.259" offset="8404407">They wanted to say that the purchaser will have what probably only a small percentage of home buyers have ever had in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.119" offset="8435858">The benefit of knowing that the appraised value set upon the property, which he intends to buy or build by a trained evaluator acting in accordance with the procedure designed to reduce to a minimum errors that might result in casual or hasty conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.238" offset="8492283">And in the subsequent year, the FHA explained that the valuation and inspections made by trained staff members of the administration tends to ensure that the dwelling is in a good physical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.134" offset="8543901">Similarly a few years later, the FHA explains, tends to ensure that the dwelling is in good physical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.779" offset="8578487">Now, this will become less equivocal as I go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.163" offset="8603982">Two or three years later, the 5th Annual Report explained, The Administration aims that no homeowner or home seeker should through ignorance of the insured mortgage plan, enter into a transaction without having the benefit of a careful disinterested examination of the property, which is the examination that is made by the FHA inspector."</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.657" offset="8698023">We now move over to 1954 when the rather thorough going revision and amendment of the National Housing Act was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.993" offset="8731355">And in the course of that revision, attention was given to the program under which homes or mortgages insuring single family homes are issued by the Federal Housing Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.794" offset="8794572">The Congress indicated a -- a considerable dissatisfaction with an attitude that had developed within the FHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.788" offset="8826546">The agency had been regarding itself more or less, as the hand making of the mortgage lending industry and of the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.740" offset="8862281">And Congress took some paying to ensure that this would not be the approach that it brought to the performance of its functions under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.621" offset="8893837">Congress provided that for the first time in 1954, that a written statement of the appraised value would have to be furnished to a perspective purchaser of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.522" offset="8945455">And the legislative history is very clear as to what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.339" offset="8964681">Congress explained that well, to be sure, the FHA should be concerned with protecting its insurance fund, the builder and the mortgagee against loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.182" offset="9008149">It said that it feel that there is a need for change in the approach or philosophy of -- of administration that the Federal Housing Administration appears to have manifested that thus far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.776" offset="9046497">Your Committee fully appreciates the importance of maintaining a high level of housing production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.938" offset="9067081">But these objectives should not obscure the fact the that first responsibility of Congress and they emphasized first and that of any agency administrating -- administering part or all of the housing program, is to protect and preserve the public interest in general and the rights of homeowners in particular, then the report went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.859" offset="9142836">It is your Commit -- Committee's considered opinion and unless contrary views are expressed or amendments are offered and there were no contrary views expressed and no amendments offered, it is the intent of Congress that the HHFA and its constituent agencies one of which is the FHA, in their administration of the program which they are authorized to carry out, shall at all times regard as a primary responsibility -- as a primary responsibility, their duty to act in the interest of the individual home purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.883" offset="9278882">Now, this same Act provided an additional protection to home buyers, those persons who were buying new homes, this was not a new home, this home had been built some time in the past before it would have been purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.269" offset="9328410">In connection with the new home program, Congress provided that the builder was required to issue a certification to the purchaser that his home had been built in accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the FHA based its appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.913" offset="9406986">Congress went onto explain, however, this is still in the Senate Report, While this affords a measure of protection to the purchaser, it does not protect him against all structural defects, poor materials or poor workmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.368" offset="9460799">Basically, the homeowner is dependent upon sound underwriting by the FHA and VA and -- and effective inspection on compliance program and your Committee would like to direct the attention of the FHA to the importance that attaches to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.756" offset="9522448">And a later point in the same report, the Committee said, It should be noted as was discussed earlier in the report that the requirement of certification is only supplemental to the compliance and inspection systems of the FHA and VA which are the primary means of insuring the construction of sound homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.129" offset="12731852">And Congress was plagued throughout this period by private acts and they were concerned about the kind of (Inaudible) of justice that was rendered by this group.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence J. Latto</label>
            <text syncTime="3460.463" offset="13945187">Well, it is true and the Government has relied very heavily on this that there are occasions on which these torts can be committed negligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.418" offset="13981027">But I think in trying to ascertain the intent of Congress, it's fair to assume that we're dealing with a number of lawyers and other laymen and the common understanding of these torts is that they are deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.196" offset="14044139">For example, there were several law review articles written shortly after the enactment of the Tort Claims Act by scholars in the law, Professor Gilhorn at Columbia, Professor Davis who's written so much in the administration of law field, and Mr. Gately who was in the Tort Claim Section of the Department of Justice at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.159" offset="14132015">All of these men referred naturally and without further consideration to the exception for deliberate torts included in 2680 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.694" offset="14166183">Now, it maybe their refined analysis will find in occasional case in which these torts are not committed deliberately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.436" offset="14193142">But certainly, the common understanding, the explanation by the framers of the bill to the Congress was that 2680 (h) included deliberate torts alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.391" offset="14236923">I'd like to say a word about the question suggested by Justice Whittaker, which related to the fact that if this -- if a -- if a deliberate misstatement had been made by an inspector, I agree that there would be no liability and it seems initially odd that there should be liability for a -- in effect, a lesser tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.822" offset="14334621">But if one looks to the structure of the Act, it seems fairly plain that libel, slander, conscious misrepresentation, this is the kind of activity which is not ordinarily engaged in by a government employee as part of his governmental functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.458" offset="14409226">If a man slanders someone, perhaps in law, he would be regarded as acting within the scope of his employment, but as a practical matter, he's not engaged in carrying out a governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.390" offset="14460949">On the other hand, if he is carrying out this inspection function and negligently performs it to someone's injury, then we have a case which falls within the classic pattern of the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.489" offset="14513298">So that isn't at least bit hard that Congress might have decided that were a government employee strays off the reservation as it were and access an individual that there should be no governmental liability, except for the unusual case where they would still be the private bill available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.791" offset="14594487">This seems to me a perfectly sensible reason for 2680 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.717" offset="14614235">Now finally, Mr. Orrick opened his argument by pointing out that if this case were affirmed, there would be vast liability visited upon the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.146" offset="14660002">I think I have two brief answers to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.864" offset="14670869">First if it were true, his argument would be addressed to the Congress and not to this Court as this Court pointed out in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.540" offset="14705560">More important perhaps is the fact that it is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.247" offset="14720397">Under the Tort Claims Act, the United States is liable only in circumstances were a private person would be liable in like circumstances to a private individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.429" offset="14761044">Under the common law, as it has been generally recognized throughout the United States, they had been limitations imposed upon the kind of widespread liability that Mr. Orrick is talking about, where a single negligent act is likely to give rise to very widespread liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.479" offset="14857279">Courts have uniformly held that there is no duty of care, the classic case in this area is the Cardozo -- Judge Cardozo's opinion in Ultramares against Touche where an accountant's certificate which might be sent very widely abroad, was held not to give -- not to give rise to a duty of care in favor to anyone that might read and rely upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.593" offset="14953723">This is to be compared with his same opinion in Glanzer against Shepard, where a public weigher was held liable to a third party who relied upon his certificate of weight, because he had reason to expect that such reliance will be given and where the extent of the liability would be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.362" offset="15056854">So long as -- as in this case, the total damage which could be inflicted upon the United States is the value of this house, the damage contented for the Government simply would not result.</text>
