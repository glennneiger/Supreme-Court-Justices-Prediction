            <text syncTime="8.834" offset="138742">At the recess from the morning hour, I was at the point of saying that the case was first tried in January 1954 resulting in a judgment for $61,600 in favor of the power company.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.602" offset="221811">The only valuation evidence offered at that trial was by the power company.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.811" offset="246575">And it related to the fee simple value of the 1540 acres covered by the power company's easement excluding only merchantable timber, which I insert parenthetically by arrangements with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.974" offset="319300">Mrs. Williams had been permitted to remove out of all the area that would be covered by the power coop.</text>

            <label>Mr. Perry W. Morton</label>
            <text syncTime="64.159" offset="360051">-- permitted to be removed out of the area that would be covered by the power coop.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.223" offset="384293">Now, the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.543" offset="397563">And as before stated, you granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, remanded the case for further consideration in the light of your Twin City decision the week before.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.994" offset="455346">On remand, the Court of Appeals was constrained to recognize that under the Twin City decision, there could be no recovery against the United States or rights which would have value only in connection with the development of the water power of a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.616" offset="545834">But in returning the case to the District Court, the Court of Appeals directed that there'd be an award to the power company of compensation for the taking of the Government's easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.133" offset="611871">Excluding from the valuation, any element of value arising from the availability, these are its words, "of the land for water power purposes due to it's being situate on a navigable stream, but including," and I resume, "other elements of value not related to the flow of the stream such as its value for agricultural or grazing purposes".</text>
            <text syncTime="160.122" offset="743842">Along the return of the case to the District Court, the Commissioners were appointed under Rule 71A (h) and were instructed to return their answers to four specific questions insisting on its position that the power company's flowage easements could have no possible value as against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.365" offset="844884">The Government again offered no valuation evidence at the retrial before the Commissioners in June of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.570" offset="877693">And after a further hearing before the Court, the District Court that is, in November of 1958, the Court entered judgment against the United States in favor of the power company, this time for $65,520 plus interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.667" offset="954075">In doing this, the Court held that the second of its inquiries to the Commissioners was and I quote, "the appropriate measure of value or compensation" is the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.707" offset="1006216">That second inquiry had directed the Commission to determine the difference between the fair market value of this Falkland Estate that belonged to Mrs. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.590" offset="1061700">The tract of 7400 acres with and without the servitude of the Government's easement, except that it would assume for that purpose that the easement, the Government's easement covered only the 1540 acres covered by VEPCO's easement up to contour 321 instead of 330 and excluding from both of such valuations any element of value arising from the availability of such land for water power development purposes due to it's being situate riparian to a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.737" offset="1242363">And in making their report, the Commissioners stated that $11,720 of the total difference of $65,520 represented "damages to the residue" of the Falkland Estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.337" offset="1332746">Well, the Government again appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.592" offset="1345703">The Court of Appeals again affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.077" offset="1355630">And at that point, you have brought the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.932" offset="1371094">On these facts, we think that the courts below have persisted in trying the wrong case.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.188" offset="1404113">And we are here in an effort to get the right case at long last decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.786" offset="1430549">In the Government's view, there is a very simple syllogism which requires a conclusion favorable to the Government against the power company.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.872" offset="1474853">The major premise of this syllogism is based upon your decision in the Twin City case that when the Government, in the exercise of its commerce power, appropriates the flow of a navigable stream for a government project, it is not obligated to pay those elements of property value which are solely dependent upon the flow of the navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.099" offset="1575790">And the minor premise of the syllogism is bottomed upon such cases as Boston Chamber of Commerce against Boston, Messer against United States, the Southern California Fishermen's Association case, United States against Petty Motors that where the United States settles with the owner of one interest in property, the question of compensation for all interests is irrelevant and only the question of just compensation for the interest taken concerns the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.151" offset="1727927">Now, I'll come back to that minor premise for a little further development in a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.008" offset="1747362">But I want to deal first with this major premise based on Twin City, currently very much dispute about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.274" offset="1780485">This case, like Twin City and Chandler-Dunbar is one in which the United States has chosen to exercise its commerce power to the fullest extent in the building of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.377" offset="1840880">Indeed, the project, as I have previously noted, and the Twin City Project were adopted, authorized and constructed under the very same authorizing Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.351" offset="1896782">Here, for the same reasons and to the same extent to paraphrase your language in Twin City, the United States has displaced all competing interests and has appropriated the entire flow of the river at this point to the declared public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.882" offset="1970866">And for the same reasons, this is not such a situation as those involved in the Gerlach Livestock Company case or the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation case where the action of Congress, as you have said, fell short of a full exercise of its constitutional power to appropriate the flow of the river to the public domain so that prior rights existing under state law were in those cases, Gerlach and Niagara Mohawk held compensable or otherwise recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.509" offset="2117360">Now, by even the stronger reason, we can put aside, as you did in Twin City, such other cases as United States against Kansas City Life upon which the respondent seems so strongly to rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.030" offset="2183502">The basic lesson to be learned from Twin City is that when the Government exercises its commerce power to the fullest extent without any qualifications, competing interests are displaced without compensation being required under the Fifth Amendment to the extent, and I agree only to the extent, that those interests have a value which is dependent, necessarily and solely upon the flow of the navigable stream, a value which the Government can either grant or withhold as it chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.539" offset="2337520">And as you have so recently as last June in the Grand River Dam case said that if the Government does not grant it, it is beholden to no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.000" offset="2379421">Now, that has been the Government's major premise in this case from the very beginning long before Twin City, long before Grand River as may be seen from the Government's original trial brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.785" offset="2434487">In 1953, which VEPCO has done us the favor of inserting in its appendix, page 214 and following of the record, "VEPCO counsel has through the years indulged in much talked about the Government changing its position."</text>
            <text syncTime="601.405" offset="2508988">Well, let the record speak for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.021" offset="2523408">In that context, however, it may be appropriate for me to point out that VEPCO's original answer to interrogatories Record 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.166" offset="2568025">It claimed compensation measured by the value of its flowage easement "for water power development purposes" and no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.347" offset="2616717">Under the stress of your remand of the case in early 1956 for reconsideration in the light of Twin City, VEPCO, of course, had to find a new theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.262" offset="2676381">A theory which we insist still gives its something for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.834" offset="2698742">Obedient to your decision in Twin City, the Court of Appeals on remand held of course that VEPCO was not entitled to values inherent in the flow of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.403" offset="2745031">And I do not understand that VEPCO is now claiming such values or could.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.776" offset="2770526">So, while the Government's major premise is by no means to be lost sight of, I would take it that the premise is now conceded by both VEPCO and the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.449" offset="2813158">Now, at the outset of the Government's second point, its minor premise so to speak, I ask you to examine what it was that VEPCO had.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.189" offset="2864149">The Government has never contested that VEPCO once had certain rights against the fee owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.528" offset="2905527">In the first place, it once had rights as against the fee owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.631" offset="2933948">Originating in the year 1907, this is a paraphrase of the language of its basic instruments, “To construct and maintain a dam in the Dan River and thereby to raise the water level at the head of Hyco Falls six feet above normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.421" offset="3009076">In the second place, it once had rights as against the fee owner originating this time in 1925 to build, I'm quoting now excerpts, "To build, to rebuild and again to build any dam or dams it might desire across the Dan River," so that the normal water level behind said dam shall not be higher than what the Government concedes here to be contour 321, resume quote, "together with all riparian rights, water rights, easements and rights of floodage related to the building of such dam on the so-called Falkland Estate," which estate released VEPCO's predecessor from any damages for, and I again resume quote, "anything done within the limits of its rights aforesaid in the development of the water power aforesaid".</text>
            <text syncTime="791.161" offset="3268002">In other words, the very documents upon which VEPCO rests and indeed must rest its claim of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.637" offset="3317948">And I would remind you that it has the burden of proving its interest show explicitly that the only easement rights which it possessed as against the owner of the fee simple title, were the very rights, which it could not lawfully exercise without the formal consent of the United States and that the prospect of any such consent ever being given vanished, disappeared, expired, terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.682" offset="3446053">As early as 1944, this case was brought in 1952, as early as 1944 when the United States decided to build its own project at this location on its own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.639" offset="3513971">Now --</text>

          <turn speaker="perry_w_morton" startTime="854.799" stopTime="1247.915">
            <label>Mr. Perry W. Morton</label>
            <text syncTime="854.799" offset="3522539">Yes, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.964" offset="3539257">There has never been any question in this case that Mrs. Williams held a fee simple title to the so-called Falkland Estate at the time of the commencement of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.860" offset="3590771">And as far as I know, she still owns that fee title.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.120" offset="3607803">The Government took only a flowage easement on that estate in strictest accord with the option agreement previously negotiated with Mrs. Williams at her own urgent request and Mrs. Williams is fully satisfied with that settlement and is honorably and consistently claiming no further or different compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.405" offset="3701008">I insist that this respondent power company, which once had only a flowage easement for power purposes on 1540 acres of the 1840 acres covered by the Government's easement had and has no right whatever as a matter of fact or law to question the settlement arrangement between Mrs. Williams and the Government for that is precisely none of its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.855" offset="3814797">Now, as already noted, the situation in this case differs from Twin City in respect to the fact that in Twin City, the company owned in fee simple the bulk of the land which the Government condemned in fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.784" offset="3882506">Twin City was therefore entitled to compensation for any other elements of value, agricultural values, timber, forestry, anything else, any other elements of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.141" offset="3927960">It could prove within the rules for determining just compensation excluding power site value.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.580" offset="3961710">The Government does not contend that the fee owner is not entitled to such other values according to the usual rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.052" offset="3999535">If we had not settled with Mrs. Williams in this case, on the basis entirely satisfactory to her, we would long since have tried the issue of just compensation with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.069" offset="4043630">But that is not this case and no amount of the confusion with which the case seems to be beset can make it so.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.067" offset="4083649">Power rights which Mrs. Williams would have had to compensation in the absence of a settlement can somehow now rub off on VEPCO involves a process of osmosis or alchemy, which I utterly fail to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.061" offset="4163584">And yet that, in its simplest terms, is the basis on which the case has been tried ever since you vacated the prior judgment and remanded the case in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.262" offset="4212381">Now, VEPCO says that a condemnation is a proceeding in rem and we wholeheartedly agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.607" offset="4253759">We insist that the only raise involved in this controversy is the flowage easement which VEPCO held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.803" offset="4294614">VEPCO says that just compensation is to be fixed without regard to the various interests in land and that the Government is not concerned with distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.891" offset="4338918">And again, this unit rule is the general rule and we readily concede it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.648" offset="4365981">In fact, the Government is first -- is the first to champion this rule when it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.915" offset="4391058">We go straight down the line with the great mass of cases in the respondent's brief in support of this proposition, the unit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.986" offset="4439333">We insist, however, that the unit principle does not apply when the unit no longer exists as when the parties themselves have destroyed the unit, as they did in the Boston Chamber of Commerce case or when the Government has already settled with the owner of one interest as it did in the Petty Motor, the Messer, the Southern California Fishermen's and so on cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.588" offset="4537762">In the Boston case, you long ago held, it was Mr. Justice Holmes I believe in 1910 that the Fifth Amendment and I quote, "does not require a disregard of the mode of ownership of the state of the title".</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.329" offset="4604740">It does not require that a parcel of land be valued as an unencumbered whole when it is not held as an unencumbered whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.891" offset="4638908">It merely requires that an owner of property taken should be paid for what has been taken from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.930" offset="4675062">And the Messer case, in the Fifth Circuit on the authority of your Petty Motor decision and I might insert that the Southern California Fishermen's case at Long Beach was almost exactly the same as the Messer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.822" offset="4730650">The Messer case said very pertinently that, "Whereas here, the Government settles with the owner of one interest the question of compensation for all interests is irrelevant and the only -- only the question of just compensation for the interest taken concerns the Government."</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.166" offset="4816018">Now, this exception to the general rule, I want to note, rests upon very sound public policy, the policy of encouraging settlements wherever possible and narrowing controversies to their minimum number and limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.419" offset="4889057">Multiple hundreds of such partial settlements are made every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.682" offset="4910059">I know because for seven and a half years, I have had a hand in approving them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.715" offset="7182190">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.095" offset="7199744">The interest of Virginia Electric &amp; Power Company are set out in the Exhibit C, just previously referred to the previous deeds and there were very numerous deeds and the 1970 was only a minor part of the flowage rights over the Falkland Estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.356" offset="7284799">We have paraphrased or quoted rather from the -- the basic provisions that are really involved in this case beginning on page 7 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.995" offset="7335372">And opposite page 7 is a chart which we submit will help with the understanding of the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.883" offset="7374869">And that shows the 7400-acre tract of the Falkland Estate at the confluence of the Banister and the Dan Rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.965" offset="7411231">And the Dan River is admittedly a navigable river in Virginia upstream from the Buggs Island Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.943" offset="7451146">You will see shaded there the areas between contour 321 and contour 330.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.124" offset="7483852">The top line of contour 330 was the extent of flowage under the Government's flowage easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.880" offset="7522931">The bottom line is the agreed contour line was stipulated where that went to between the parties before the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.839" offset="7574758">Virginia Electric &amp; Power Company was the successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.345" offset="7592730">I won't go through all the steps but as a matter of fact, there was a deed, the very next exhibit in the record, a deed of January 1942 from the plea owner making certain corrections in the previous deed that I preferred to and which is paraphrased beginning on page 7 which sets out that the power company had the right to build a dam on this tract that you see on page 6 and also to flood permanently and it was a permanent easement to keep water at all times up to contour 321 of this 7400-acre tract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.120" offset="7767855">And that was not of course limited to a dam on the Falkland tract but said any dam downstream, of course, from this area that VEPCO or its predecessor entitled, had the right to perpetually and permanently overflow the land up to contour 321.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.075" offset="7855626">There were other rights in there and as a matter of fact, I should call the Court's attention since this amount of damages to the residue has been talked about so much to the fourth provision of the deed which we quote, at the bottom, beginning at the bottom of page 7 of our brief which says forth, "Falkland Estate Incorporated, that hereby covenant to run with the land that it hereby grant and release all claims for damages to the residue of the real estate as the result of the flooding of any of the present land of the said Falkland Estate," which is the 7400 acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.962" offset="8079235">In other words, we had, at the date of the taking, an easement in gross commercial assignable easement in gross to keep water permanently over the land up to contour 321 without the payment of any further compensation to the owner of the underlying fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.626" offset="8169827">Now, my friend states that there was a settlement in this case with the fee owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.933" offset="8215071">And I am astounded because the Government's attorney, at the very outset of this case, and it appears in the record on page 34, said that the Government obtained "nothing" under this option agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.267" offset="8292394">And the same thing is true of the responses to the interrogatories that we asked, "Do you claim that you've gotten anything from the fee owner?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.924" offset="8331055">And they said, "Definitely, no."</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.132" offset="8343907">We have that set out in our brief and I won't take anymore time with it on page 10 where we refer to the Government's interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.444" offset="8381106">And yet, my adversary says, and that's why I think I'll have to go on to the facts of this case a little bit more, he says the courts below, and they have tried this thing or heard it three times, have been trying the wrong case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.366" offset="8440874">And it's only now that we are getting to the right case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.172" offset="8456025">But the truth of the matter is that's the difference between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.569" offset="8469608">We've been trying in the court below an entirely different case from what I've heard up here this morning or this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.944" offset="8499179">Because when you start out with what the Government took and then discuss what were the rights in this land, there's no -- you -- there's -- there's just all the difference in the world between the cases appears in the record and the cases made out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.987" offset="8575352">Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked him a moment ago about where in the pleadings did the easement -- VEPCO's easements rights appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.520" offset="8617462">Well, he said something about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.986" offset="8623313">Answered that VEPCO was main -- a main party to the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.381" offset="13140929">And incidentally, it wasn't the -- the Fourth Circuit's brainchild after the remand from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.213" offset="13176247">The Government had argued on the first trial that if we have to pay, you valued it improperly by taking the fee value because we have this permanent flowage you see to overflow the land permanently because we are not taking that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.462" offset="13233194">We're taking less than that so please only value our easement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.686" offset="13258167">Well, we argued when we got back to the Fourth Circuit that since we hadn't got any water power value, the first go around just please affirm the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.141" offset="13291917">But the court then agreed with the Government and said, "Oh no, the Government isn't taking as much as you have and it's not damaging the land as much as you would damage the land, so we're going to send it back and tried on that basis."</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.046" offset="13339564">So you see, when you are valuing the land as coextensive with our easement, the before and after value naturally includes damages to the residue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3565.948" offset="14367117">But there, if you did have the Mississippi River definitely a navigable stream and a dam that it in the exercise of the paramount navigation servitude and the -- and the Government condemned against the railroad company, a long stretch of railroad right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.871" offset="14438902">And some -- there were four segments in that case that there was some controversy about as to whether it was within under high-water mark in the -- in the bed of the stream and therefore, subject to the -- to the Government's paramount navigation servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.654" offset="14497938">And the Government admitted in that case and the rest of it where they made compensation, I do not how much but anyway, they paid compensation for that taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.605" offset="14533778">And then as to the four, when you reverse it and sent it back, you said, it'd be just a question of fact that any of the easements that were above high-water mark, they were entitled to compensation for the extra riprapping that they had to do in order to keep the -- the waters of the Mississippi River that have been pushed up on the land by this navigation dam offer of the railroad right away.</text>

            <text syncTime="5382.203" offset="21632188">Now, as to the question of whether a decision had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.211" offset="21652250">A decision as to the particular land, indeed, had not been made at the inception of this correspondence April 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.883" offset="21686941">And now I'm looking at page 159, the replying letter of Mr. Heasley (ph) -- I mean to Mr. Heasley (ph) by the project engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.086" offset="21727692">A decision hadn't been made because the -- this, as I said in my opening statement, was in the highest reaches of the project area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.823" offset="21762696">And up in those reaches, they sometimes do take flowage easements and sometimes they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.337" offset="21788714">Individual decision had not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.164" offset="21799999">But the engineer here or rather the project engineer very plainly says in the last paragraph of his letter, replying to the first letter, "It has been the policy to acquire a fee simple interest in all lands within the reservoir area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.637" offset="21861961">However, your position in this matter is much appreciated and your letter is being forward to the district office for consideration and reply."</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.552" offset="21893622">Now, that runs through quite of course of history and you'll find the exhibits here in the following and there was indeed a colonel of the Corps of Engineers that I couldn't have possibly expected to know about the Chandler-Dunbar case or some of the others who did make the statement at one time that -- "Well, we'll have to close this up with you, Mrs. Williams, and then we'll have to deal with VEPCO for whatever we have to acquire from it."</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.236" offset="22008351">But when they came to writing contracts, I would refer you to the option at -- which begin at page 58.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.292" offset="22048580">There was an implication that we have got nothing under this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.334" offset="22064671">I thought two that I had covered that in my opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.460" offset="22089226">Running through the record here -- well, I would hesitate to consume the time to do it during an open session.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.572" offset="22125693">The only words that do not track here in the option agreement with the estate taken in the complaint and declaration of taking is that where at one point here, the words "permanently" or "intermittently" were omitted in the option agreement but were put in the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.330" offset="22196642">Now, what difference does that make?</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.428" offset="22205106">As long as it is a whole complete right perpetual to overflow as maybe necessary as a result of the construction maintenance and operation of the Buggs Island Dam and Reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.742" offset="22258291">Now, all you need to look at is the 2681-acre case decided about the same time as Twin City in the Fourth Circuit involving this very same project in which the Fourth Circuit said very plainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.220" offset="22316283">Well, permanently or intermittently this -- this is an important element of valuation but the whole thing is keyed to what is necessary to operate the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="5627.582" offset="22613661">Now, if I may deal with -- oh, I -- I want to deal with this option a moment more.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.394" offset="22644903">What did Mrs. Williams give under the option? Everything is described here precisely the same as it is in the declaration of taking and in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.798" offset="22682520">And then she says, "Reserving however to the vendor," that's her, "and her assigns, all such rights and privileges as maybe used and enjoyed without interfering with or abridging the estate rights and interest to be conveyed to the United States in the above described premises subject only," this is record 63, "to the following rights outstanding in 3rd persons namely," then a paragraph begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.573" offset="22805713">So far, this is a printed form in the original."</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.491" offset="22825357">Subject to such water, flowage, riparian and other rights, if any, which the Virginia Electric &amp; Power Company has in or on the above described lands."</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.087" offset="22883767">Now, there is also, as I pointed out in my opening, another provision in the option which gave the Government the right to perfect its interest as against Mrs. Williams by either of two methods, by taking a deed which she agreed to give or by filing a condemnation if for any reason it wasn't satisfied with the deed situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.001" offset="22987421">In this case, we filed the condemnation, exercising the privilege under this option.</text>
            <text syncTime="5726.323" offset="23008632">Although it isn't mentioned in the brief, I would -- I think the name of the case is the old Albrecht case which says that an option is then used as the contractual method as a stipulation of settlement to determine the compensation within the framework of the condemnation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.348" offset="23080730">Now, there's been something said here about a suppose differentiation between a case which rest wholly as Chandler-Dunbar did within the bed of the navigable river and something that lies up above high-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.367" offset="23152828">But I would point out that this is exactly the situation that you dealt with in Twin City.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.566" offset="23173622">And if there's any doubt about it, I would like to read this paragraph or at least a part of it from your Twin City decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.414" offset="23205073">This is at the bottom of 225 over to the top of 226 of 350 U.S."</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.882" offset="23234853">It is argued, however, that the special water rights value should be awarded to owners of this land since it lies not in the bed of the river nor below high-water but above and beyond the ordinary high-water mark."</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.959" offset="23303189">An effort is made by this argument to establish that this private land is not burdened with the Government's servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.118" offset="23335894">The flaw in that reasoning is that the landowner here seeks the value in the flow of the stream a value that inheres in the Government servitude and one that under our decisions the Government can grant or withhold as it chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.396" offset="23416978">It is no answer to say that payment is sought only for the location value of the fast lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.497" offset="23457311">That special occasion value is due to the flow of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.335" offset="23484688">And if the United States were required to pay the judgments below, it would be compensating the landowner for the increment of value added to the fast lands if the flow of the stream were taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.181" offset="23544142">The Twin City is square on the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.185" offset="23556159">So I would summarize very quickly in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.307" offset="23576639">There's been something said here about our -- suppose we could have gone out and dealt with VEPCO alone and ignored Mrs. Williams, oh, I submit that this is a complete impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.050" offset="23631600">What did she have?</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.487" offset="23637347">Just in plain real property terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.454" offset="23657200">Suppose that this Falkland Estate is X in a mathematical formula, what she had at one time was X minus VEPCO which was a right to flood as against her but which could not, under any circumstance, be exercised by VEPCO without a permit or a license rather from the Federal Power Commission under the Water Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.320" offset="23760645">And at the time of the approval of this project by Congress in 1944 or at least by the time Congress became irrevocably committed to the building of the project through appropriation and the construction which was in 1946, it began, at least by then, any possibility of there being any value in flowage rights against which the United States are on top of which, if you please, the United States had superimposed its constitutional power under the Commerce Clause and I make no apology for the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.436" offset="23941099">At that moment, the VEPCO's interest disappeared into thin air.</text>
