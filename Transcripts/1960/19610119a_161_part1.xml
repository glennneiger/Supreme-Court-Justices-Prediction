            <label>Mr. Alexander A. Goldfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="22.075" offset="191718">Honorable Members of this Court, I am the special public defender appointed by the Superior Court of Hartford County one year after the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.567" offset="233618">Petitioner, Your Honors please, is under sentence of death for the crime of murder in the first-degree on two counts, committed in the course of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.284" offset="284505">He seeks reversal of the judgement by a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Errors of the State of Connecticut which affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.867" offset="318882">The petitioner is raising the issues in this case, involved the admission of three written confessions and one oral confession which were taken as follows, one on Wednesday, February 27th, five days after his apprehension and custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.136" offset="411878">Another, Sunday, taken March 3rd, nine days after his apprehension and three days after he was formally charged with murder and third, the third one taken on Monday, March 4, 10 days after his apprehension and four days after he was formally charged with murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.068" offset="495679">An oral confession was taken on Wednesday afternoon, February 27th, the day that he gave the first written confession, in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.823" offset="534653">He gave the oral confession in the afternoon and the written confession late that evening or in the early morning hours of Thursday, February 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.135" offset="575927">We claim that these confessions, all of them, were coerced and involuntary and the latter two, namely the ones that were pro -- procured on Sunday and Monday were not only coerced and involuntary, but were procured in denial of counsel in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.057" offset="667564">The undisputed facts supporting these contentions are unequivocally and amply set forth in the record and are particularly outlined in our brief on a day-by-day analysis as stated in pages 4 through 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.116" offset="747813">It should be noted and it is very noteworthy that when the question of voluntariness is an issue in a court in the State of Connecticut, it is incumbent upon the State to prove that the confession was not involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.823" offset="818657">In other words, the burden of proof is not upon the defendant to prove voluntariness, but upon the State to prove they were not involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.531" offset="865468">I think it is well to consider, in considering all of the elements of coercion in this case and this case is a classic one, if I have ever saw one, Members of this Court, that we are dealing here essentially with a mental defective, a man who has the mentality of a nine to a nine and a half year old child with an IQ of 60, with the history of being confined in two state mental institutions, the Bridgewater State Hospital and the Wrentham State Hospital of Massachusetts when he was 17, a man who has been classified as a moron when he was 33 at the time of this crime and classified as an imbecile when he was 17, when he was first confined in the Bridgewater -- Bridgewater State Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.785" offset="1070477">A man whom the state psychiatrist conceded as a moron of a low grade or middle grade caliber and a man who, according to Bertram P.Ibelle, the clinical psychologist in this case, stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.504" offset="1133380">All testing is consistent and indicative that this is clearly a feeble-minded individual, whose adjustment, both personal and social, could at best be marginal.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.152" offset="1183953">His performance is that of a middle grade moron and he can be properly labeled moderately defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.604" offset="1217808">In addition to being settled with deficient mental equipment with which he must try to cope with life's problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.256" offset="1244348">Mr. Culombe is also possessed of that character defect so frequently found in individuals of low intellectual caliber, namely he is enormously suggestible.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.260" offset="1292413">Thus, lacking in the capacity for sufficient critical judgment, his manner of thinking, his pattern of living and his way of behaving can all be easily influenced by those persons closest to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.420" offset="1353017">When the influences are benign, he gets along.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.559" offset="1369631">When the opposite obtains, he is in trouble.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.050" offset="1891558">And we have set forth these facts, beginning at page 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.060" offset="1919561">First, Arthur Culombe was taken into custody, Saturday, February 23rd, at the State Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.574" offset="1957700">He was taken for a ride by three policemen through the County of Hartford and Coventry and Rocky Hill and various places around Hartford for purposes of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.937" offset="1995107">After four or five hours of questioning in the car, he was returned to the State Police Barracks, State Police Headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.379" offset="2024887">There, he was further questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.280" offset="2036485">Further, he was again taken back to his house where he was confronted with his wife and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.401" offset="2065011">And then he was sent back into the private car of the police where the Sergeant Paige talked with the -- with his wife while her husband was waiting outside to be carried back to the police barracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.627" offset="2113912">When he was returned to the police barracks that evening at 8 p.m., he was again questioned by -- by Lieutenant Rome, who was the chief protagonist, who was the leader of the -- of this group of mass relay questioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.125" offset="2159888">Lieutenant Rome questioned him further and at 10 o'clock that evening -- evening, placed him under arrest without a warrant, under our felony statute.</text>
