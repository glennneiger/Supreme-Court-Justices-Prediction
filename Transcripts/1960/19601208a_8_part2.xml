            <label>Mr. John M. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.500" offset="138407">Immediately prior to the luncheon recess, I had attempted and had started to compare the Sunday sales laws of the colonial period -- period of Maryland with those in existence -- there's an existence today.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.055" offset="208624">Quite unlike the colonial period when we had laws, commanding, the attendance of church laws, prohibiting liquor being sold on Sunday, laws prohibiting gambling that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.256" offset="253450">The picture of Sunday in Anne Arundel County today is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.312" offset="269646">There is no commercial activity except those relating to recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.758" offset="291380">You can keep an amusement park open, a beach -- bathing beach, bath house, picnic grove, dancing saloon, bar, tavern that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.745" offset="343416">Now, like it or not, those are amusements for great segment to the people -- of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.718" offset="363269">It may be that this Court or a legislature could pick more wholesome amusements than dancing saloons and a sale of liquor and gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.177" offset="393153">The fact is that they do exist in Anne Arundel County on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.938" offset="408200">That is the Sunday in Anne Arundel County.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.355" offset="421784">Now, that's the state of the law and the state of Sunday as it existed on September 28, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.188" offset="449160">On that day, seven employees of a large discount house ran by a corporation known as Two Guys from Harrison were arrested, for the sale of the items which we discussed earlier today, namely, the three-ring, loose-leaf binder, the can of simonize, staples and staplers and a toy submarine.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.687" offset="531184">They were arrested because those items did not come within the exceptions set forth in the Anne Arundel County statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.604" offset="702861">To answer Your -- Your Honor's question, you asked how the -- whether it was by indictment or information, it was by warrant before justice of the peace charged in the violation of 521.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.937" offset="748105">That is the -- the setting of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.167" offset="761062">Now, my brother says that this constitutes a law which violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.330" offset="785721">We say that they have absolutely no standing to object to the free -- under the Free Exercise Clause of that Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.796" offset="815606">There's nothing in this record to show that any of the defendants, religious practices were interfered.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.703" offset="839220">In fact, the record doesn't even show if they have any religion or what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.188" offset="853117">There's nothing in the record about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.208" offset="861268">We say that under those circumstances, they clearly have no standing to raise the objection that the free exercise of their religion has been, in any manner, hampered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.473" offset="906303">Now, in answer to Justice Frankfurter's question, I didn't quite understand my brother's statement as to what his standing was.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.015" offset="936500">We had taken it to be simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.385" offset="945904">That anybody, be he an atheist, be he a Catholic or Jew, any religion or no religion has the right to challenge a law if he says it establishes a religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.143" offset="984984">We do not challenge that.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.253" offset="1089369">Well, I'm assuming you were prosecuted under that law Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.056" offset="1100654">See, the -- these defendants were, this is a criminal prosecution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.877" offset="1119880">The other cases were our three-judge court to enjoin.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.105" offset="1132837">I'm sorry, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.721" offset="1139315">So, we feel that the question then comes down in this case under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.245" offset="1153421">Is this a law establishing a religion?</text>
            <text syncTime="265.555" offset="1166587">Now, putting to one side for a moment the argument of economic coercion, just looking at the statute itself, we say this is hardly a law establishing a religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.360" offset="1205875">We think if anything it encourages activities which are not ordinarily associated with the -- the Christian Sunday or any other religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.886" offset="1239939">So, let's turn to this argument that's made about economic coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.139" offset="1256970">Let's examine it for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.285" offset="1265539">It's been stated several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.082" offset="1272748">In essence, it's simply this, that because there is a Sunday law which prohibits retail activities, a Sabbatarian who by his religious beliefs is prevented from operating on Saturday and Friday afternoon is in a position where he sells four and a half days a week whereas the non-Sabbatarian sells six.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.692" offset="1359161">Well, that in essence, as I understand it is the contention that's made.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.575" offset="1374730">And they say that this amounts to the establishment of a religion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.997" offset="1396360">And our position is -- is a simple one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.729" offset="1407331">And it's simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.360" offset="1413810">That in the society in which we live, there must be an accomodation between religion and the civil regulations, that always happens when you have a civil society.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.525" offset="1458531">It's not common to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.532" offset="1466472">An example was given in the first case of a Catholic -- a Catholic individual who has children that he sends to a Catholic school.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.615" offset="1498864">Now, note he sends them to a Catholic school by his voluntary choice, prompted of course, by the articles of his faith, but he does send them to a Catholic school.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.479" offset="1538361">That being the case, he also is supporting the public school by taxes which he doesn't use.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.299" offset="1561558">It is a public system, a law establishing a religion either is an economic burthen place on this Catholic that's not shared by other members in society.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.647" offset="1602936">Is that a law established in a religion?</text>
            <text syncTime="376.854" offset="1611818">Could a Catholic come in to this Court and say, "I must be exempt from paying taxes under the general school system?"</text>
            <text syncTime="383.374" offset="1637940">And then let us take the case of a man whose religion prohibits the use of medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.750" offset="1659361">Could he come in here and say that I cannot be taxed for public health services, that because that puts me under a burthen by doing something, by paying something for which I cannot use because of my religion, I must be exempt from them?</text>
            <text syncTime="402.229" offset="1713277">Is that the type of thing the First Amendment was intended to prevent?</text>
            <text syncTime="406.522" offset="1730518">Now, we respectfully submit that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.240" offset="1741385">And what about another type of coercion?</text>
            <text syncTime="411.487" offset="1750371">What about the selective service cases this Court decided?</text>
            <text syncTime="415.419" offset="1766045">Take a situation in which a religion because of the tenets of that faith or render somebody immune from the draft because of many exemption in the draft statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.688" offset="1803139">Naturally, that's coercion if you wish to call it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.366" offset="1813901">People who had no religion sometimes we came very religious at the draft board, for those that had a religion that did not prohibit war would naturally be coerced if it is coercion and the change in a religion if they feared serving their country and possibly dying in war.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.015" offset="1876490">It's another type of coercion that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.491" offset="1886312">And what about aid to religion?</text>
            <text syncTime="447.088" offset="1892791">This Court has said that aid to religion is just as bad as an interference with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.108" offset="1916824">How have those cases fear -- fair?</text>
            <text syncTime="455.759" offset="1927481">Well of course, we have the fact that payments to a Catholic hospital are not illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.661" offset="1947021">There's nothing that violates the First Amendment in that if it's for general purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.232" offset="1965307">We found that the distribution of schoolbooks to all students including those attending to Catholic school is not necessarily bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.453" offset="1994250">Now that case actually did involve the First Amendment religious freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.914" offset="2008043">It's a due process case but we held it wasn't bad because the purpose was to educate children not to help the religious school.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.007" offset="2036464">And what about the reimbursements to the parent sending children to Catholic schools in the Everson case?</text>
            <text syncTime="489.011" offset="2060392">How do we square that?</text>
            <text syncTime="490.706" offset="2067184">Well, it seems to us that it comes down to just this.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.743" offset="2079410">That when you have a direct aid to religion or direct interference, well that's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.489" offset="2102397">But if you have a statute that has a secular purpose, substantial secular purpose, the mere fact that there might be an incidental burthen, an incidental benefit to a particular religion does not make it bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.016" offset="2148477">And I point that out specifically with the Zorach case.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.808" offset="2163628">There was a reference here made that our cases go beyond that on a contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.866" offset="2183899">We say our case is clearly to the right of the Zorach case if you wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.970" offset="2204275">There, there was no secular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.388" offset="2213992">In the Zorach case, this soul purpose about law was to accommodate the school system to religious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.250" offset="2245444">Now, I think that was true and there was no dispute between the majority and the minority of this Court on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.554" offset="2266655">There was no secular purpose involved in accommodating the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.390" offset="2285986">This Court thought that that was a legitimate object and upheld that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.878" offset="2303958">Now, we say taking the Zorach case, there, of course, was some incidental coercion I think and the mere fact that school children like to conform as this Court pointed out in Brown versus Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.938" offset="2352128">Children in school feel when they have treated differently from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.657" offset="2371041">That this Court sustained the Zorach case even though those who did not go to school -- did not go to religious classes, were forced to remain in school during the so-called release time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.027" offset="2416494">Now, we say that if you compare that case with the McCollum case which was stricken down, the difference we think is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.775" offset="2443452">That this Court stated in the Zorach case in McCollum, there was an actual use of state supported school property, the school buildings for these religious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.884" offset="2483890">Now, we say that wasn't just the case of real estate being used but it was a direct, a direct participation by the school system in these religious practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.727" offset="2523282">That we think is the difference between the Zorach case and the McCollum case, direct participation by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.643" offset="2550972">Now, direct participation, direct burthens are unconstitutional but we respectfully submit that when there is a valid secular purpose, the mere fact that you have an incidental burthen or an incidental benefit is part of the price we pay for having a lay state and not a state which is governed by religion but of a civil regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.343" offset="2637803">I might add that in the -- by the same token the various other incidental encouragements which we have by laws making Christmas a legal holiday by this Court itself not sitting on Sundays as to other courts by the very oath that the attorneys of this bar take, by the very try that's given by the Court trier.God save this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.923" offset="2720037">Those are things that are tolerated if you wish because they do not directly forward a religion or directly impede one.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.911" offset="2752010">They're incidental to our culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.896" offset="2771968">Now, finally I would like to emphasize the fact that this is an attack on a Maryland statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.820" offset="2795687">Keep in mind, none of these individuals have come in here and shown any economic damage, none of them have said that it interferes with their religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.576" offset="2830691">It is a flat attack on a statute -- on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.493" offset="2842394">Now, if this Court should decide, which I respectfully submit it should not, that Sabbatarians must necessarily be exempted from the Sunday laws or that Sunday laws are invalid as applied to Sabbatarians.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.902" offset="2892027">The convictions in this case must still stand Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.808" offset="2903625">This is not a case where there is a Sabbatarian objecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.188" offset="2917104">He's objecting to the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.352" offset="2925777">And I think the answer is if they're invalid as to Sabbatarians, it does not affect the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.180" offset="2961095">Now, we move to the other contentions which my brother made, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.394" offset="2978022">He says that these laws are arbitrary or arbitrary classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.469" offset="2998293">In making that argument, he assumes the point an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.078" offset="3012712">On a one hand, he -- it's consistent but he still assumes the point an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.143" offset="3029013">He says, "This is a religious day.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.084" offset="3036745">It's perfectly ridiculous to sell beer and whiskey and not sell orange juice.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.099" offset="3056807">It's perfectly ridiculous to permit gambling and not to sale a blue slip binders."</text>
            <text syncTime="743.279" offset="3077496">Well, the answer is that this is a not a religious statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.195" offset="3089199">It's a civil regulation which encourages, if you will, recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.854" offset="3107798">The recreation, as I have mentioned, involved in drinking, involved in frequent in tavern is there for people who enjoy it, and it is a religious type of -- I mean a -- it is a -- an -- a recreational type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.213" offset="3161297">I don't think the same as true about selling cans of orange juice or loose-leaf binders.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.060" offset="3180628">If we examine the various items which can be sold, they clearly fall into those two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.312" offset="3205601">Those which go to necessities such as bread and milk, that type of thing, those that go to recreation such as dancing saloons, bath houses, beaches, taverns and things of that nature, and slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.312" offset="3261607">Thank Your Honor, and pinball machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.595" offset="3274773">I think that is the difference between the classification test that we have here and the one that my brother would have to apply which has no application because it is not a religious a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.351" offset="3321793">Now, insofar as there's been an attempt to say that there is some law in Maryland that says somebody at the beach can sell and somebody a block away cannot sell, at least the Attorney General's office knows of no such law.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.574" offset="3374665">This law has been enforced in Maryland in this manner in Anne Arundel County.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.043" offset="3392533">That if the item is one which is customarily sold at a beach house, a bathing beach or what have you then it is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.566" offset="3426701">These people were not arrested because of the fact that they sold something that could be sold at the beach other than at the beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.359" offset="3453868">That's the argument that they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.262" offset="3461496">In fact, they didn't quite make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.255" offset="3469437">They said that the toy submarine is one which could be sold at the beach and therefore, we should be allowed to sell it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.477" offset="3494306">The State didn't argue to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.340" offset="3501725">The State argued that it was not an item which was so clearly one that was sold at the beach that the Court should say as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.557" offset="3530668">It was a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.791" offset="3535579">The Court decided against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.479" offset="3542267">The Court of Appeals of Maryland upheld that and specifically said in their opinion that they did not have to decide as other question which was raised, as to whether or not the sales could be made elsewhere than at the beach itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.940" offset="3604125">And I call Your Honor's attention to the Section of the -- of the brief where that passage is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.194" offset="3653130">It's at page 41 of the appellant's jurisdictional statement which is a statement from the Court in which they specifically point out that they do not have to decide that point since it's not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.317" offset="3697643">That is the only judicial determination or interpretation of Section 509 in answer to Justice Stewart's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.850" offset="3731811">Now, what is the other reason or reasons why this statute it says -- it said to be unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="914.021" offset="3760441">Well, they say the statute is vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.647" offset="3770995">They said that there, our people Two Guys from Harrison who sell, as my brother said everything under the sun, would not know what he -- what they could sell and what they couldn't sell because we have an item of things customarily sold at bathing beaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.622" offset="3826897">But, we respectfully submit that that is a valid classification, it's not vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.644" offset="3846959">The person of ordinary intelligence can tell what's customarily sold there and as this Court has said the mere fact that you cannot define it with mathematical precision doesn't render it bad and as this Court has also said in the Boyce Motor Lines case, "It's not unfair," and this is "to require that one who deliberately goes peerlessly close to an area of proscribe conduct shall take the risk that he may cross the line."</text>
            <text syncTime="964.458" offset="3962211">Well, it seems to us that when a discount house sells all these items that they -- it behooves them to come in and say that they were misled by the language of the statute which relates specifically to items sold at bathing beaches an incidental thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.062" offset="4028667">The last point which was raised by my brother is a fact that these exceptions are not uniform throughout the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.118" offset="4064820">Well, our answer to that is two fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.647" offset="4070985">Number one, he didn't raise it below.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.066" offset="4080703">There's no contention in the Court of Appeals on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.041" offset="4092510">But secondly, and of equal importance, is the fact that this Court has already decided the case, a Maryland case, a case from Anne Arundel County, a case that had exceptions peculiar to Anne Arundel County and has upheld it and that dissolves for Salsburg case in 346 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.231" offset="4161369">In that case, we have what it -- is known in Maryland as a Bowers Act which prohibits in misdemeanor prosecutions, evidence illegally obtained, obtained in violation of the search and seizure laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.343" offset="4213718">There is an exception from that statute of Anne Arundel County in gambling prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.848" offset="4227824">In gambling prosecutions in Anne Arundel County such evidence is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.304" offset="4257604">Now, it came to this Court on the grounds that that was illegal because it was not statewide in application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.090" offset="4280801">It violated also its principles as were alleged including the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.615" offset="4302848">This Court said that the obligation was not on a state to prove the reason for that exemption but it was the obligation on the other side to prove the lack of such reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.625" offset="4346943">Now here, we come up with a record that is totally barren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.300" offset="4361571">They didn't even raise the point below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.743" offset="4371393">We respectfully submit that as this Court said, the mere fact that use county lines as a distinction does not necessarily make it bad, the burthen is on the party attacking it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.224" offset="4409323">He has not only not carried that burthen in this case, he didn't even attempt to below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.582" offset="4426773">There's nothing in the record on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.404" offset="4438058">So, we feel that there can hardly be any contention made on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.481" offset="4482361">In summary, we submit that this is purely a case of a civil -- of a civil regulation which has been enforced in Maryland for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.107" offset="4520814">We have no exception for the Jewish faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.010" offset="4532412">We have no exceptions at all, except for taking the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.328" offset="4549757">We respectfully submit that that law does not violate any of the fundamental freedoms which were incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, that it does not violate the First Amendment or any decision in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.973" offset="4604301">Thank you.</text>
