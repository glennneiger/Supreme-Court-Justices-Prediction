            <text syncTime="31.605" offset="229752">This case involves the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.730" offset="250337">It is a question of a certificate to transport gas under Section 7 of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.083" offset="295685">The particular part of the application that's involved here is what is known as the transportation of X-20 gas, which is somewhat unusual and I'll try to describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.326" offset="368724">Under the tariff, proposed tariff, the X-20 was gas that Consolidated Edison Company, New York, bought directly from the producers in Texas at $19.25 for 1000 cubic feet to have transported by the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation to New York City with the restriction on the use of the gas that it could only be used as fuel for boilers.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.610" offset="545834">The record is clear that the purpose of the restriction was for the producers to avoid any regulation of the price of their gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.499" offset="613334">The examiner in considering it -- well there's a further factor that is of importance, and that is that Transco, Transcontinental Pipe Line Company, agreed that for a period of 60 days at the election of Consolidated Edison, they would furnish their own gas that could be used for resale in the New York City area, to Consolidated Edison in the portion of the pipeline that had otherwise been provided under this X-20, for the transportation of this gas, Consolidated Edison that Consolidated Edison bought directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.756" offset="1802428">There, they had a provision that they could get during the peaking period for the 60 days at their election up to 50,000, the same amount, from Transco of resalable gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.297" offset="1864600">Their testimony was that they were going to use only 25,000 because they were going to use 25,000 of the X-20 gas that they bought themselves in the boilers, in two boilers at water side, in order to take care of the air pollution and the rest, they would proceed to use for resale for their peaking purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.696" offset="3410108">On the other hand, I did feel that I had to deal with it because there is an act to the Congress that says that the United States has appropriated $5,000,000 to cooperate with the states, that the states have a primary obligation about air pollution and whatever research could be developed, in that regard, the United States would cooperate and then the President of the United States issued the Executive Order in which he directed that people in the United States Government cooperate with the states and cities to see that whatever could be done about our own industry that is governmental industries, did not contribute to air pollution.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.316" offset="3788675">And on the -- on the considerations of conservation, the superior use as compared with the inferior use, and whether that can be considered by the Commission in regard to determining whether certificates should be issued, is the basic issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.906" offset="3878954">Now the Commission did determine that it would not issue a certificate in this case, and this is a Section 7 application, I want to make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.231" offset="3928273">It's not a rate case application.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.104" offset="3939767">It's a certificate for transportation in which Section 7 comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.004" offset="3967352">And the Commission held that in this kind of a situation, there were four basic reasons why in the public convenience and necessity under that condition as provided in Section 7, this -- at this certificate could not be required by the public interest -- by the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.657" offset="4081977">Because, first, they felt it would breakdown the practice over a period of some 20 years of the purchase of gas and resale by the transmission companies and would be damaging to that established price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.244" offset="4168391">Secondly, they felt that it would inflate prices in competition to have these various large users go into the marketplace and bid against the pipelines to require gas and resell it in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.036" offset="4235473">And it would drive the prices up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.739" offset="4246340">Third, they said that the small consumers wouldn't have the buying power to engage in any such practices as this and they would be forced to have -- to acquire their purchases through the transmission companies of the pipelines in the same way and would be adversely affected by the fact that prices and the pipeline gas would be driven up, but they couldn't compete by going out and trying to get the gas at the lesser price.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.535" offset="4681540">The Commission was trying to hold gas in this particular area where Consolidated Edison went in and bought and paid $19.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.285" offset="4712469">They were trying to hold it below 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.520" offset="4725426">Consolidated Edison, in order to get this large chunk of gas under these terms that would not be regulated, went in and bid $19.25 and got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.575" offset="4769625">And that had the effect of lifting prices in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.970" offset="4799300">The -- the testimony from Transco on the other hand, was that they couldn't -- they did not dare try to buy this gas at -- in competition with Consolidated Edison and I think the inference is fair, probably lower than even $19.25, because it would escalate other prices they had on gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.126" offset="4899924">But there's no question to what they paid substantially, above the general market that the pipelines had been paying for this gas, but the producer said, “We don't want any regulation as a part of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.994" offset="4951333">And they gave them that part of the agreement so they wouldn't get regulated and agreed to use it for this limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.108" offset="4983829">Now, it's also clear this doesn't help Transco at all on getting its load factor railings like this type of gas sometimes does where there's a direct purchase and its run through the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.543" offset="5049553">It doesn't help on that kind of a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.961" offset="5059166">It does give them more money, because they get paid a fair price and there's no controversy about that for transporting the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.062" offset="5099604">But the Court of Appeals reversed the Commission and held that it had no right because of what it said the legislative history was, to consider the conservation factors that is the end use of the gas in any way, that if could -- couldn't consider whatever was done about buying the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.753" offset="5206392">It couldn't consider whatever was done about the use of the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.701" offset="5222170">The only thing it had a right to do was consider whether or not the gas could be transported, and it said that in regard to that, it was to examine the conventional, as it described it, factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.982" offset="5287267">Now, it's the position of the Federal Power Commission that when the Court of Appeals so held, it disregarded the true legislative history of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.684" offset="5342124">In the first place, the 1938 Act was passed as you will recall, with a provision that the Commission would have jurisdiction of certificate cases in regard to transportation only where there was another gas line -- transmission line in the area and it would not have in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.054" offset="5451630">Now, it was found in 1942 that that was -- in the experience up to 1942, but that was not an adequate solution for the problems in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.218" offset="5500217">And there was a considerable -- there were recommendations that the conservation factors of having a number of lines come in to a particular area could not be adequately dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.890" offset="5558941">There were also the factors of the other fuel interests and the transportation interest of other fuels, were not permitted to intervene under the 1938 Act and present a showing as to the fact that coal or the transportation of coal could adequately take care of the fuel needs of a particular proposal of a certificate or application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.620" offset="5677850">And therefore, that factor could not be properly taken into account by the Commission the Commission had so taken that position in some of its holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.612" offset="5721840">And so that Congress, with expressed reference to conservation, had amended the Act so as to make it possible for the Commission to go into any application for extension or new transmission lines wherever there was application, wherever there was an attempt to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.886" offset="5822882">And also, to allow the intervention of other fuel interests and transportation interests to show that other fuels could be used to greater advantage and conserve the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.233" offset="5884322">Now, the Court of Appeals relied upon the 1944 statement of the Federal Power Commission in regard to conservation in which it had said in a report to Congress that it didn't have the comprehensive right to control conservation and disregarded the footnote to that statement, which was clearly set out to the effect that they didn't have the right to control the direct sales to industry or to suspend the rates on indirect sales to industry through the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.846" offset="6050774">And it made it explicit that it was the comprehensive control of these other things that it needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.033" offset="6091525">And in 1944, the same year, the Federal Power Commission in reporting on a resolution by the Senate, which suggested a complete examination or investigation by the Federal Power Commission into conservation of gas and other fuels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.511" offset="6177416">In reporting on that, the Federal Power Commission expressly told the Senate Committee that it had the power to regulate and it considered the end use under in certificate cases, and that it needed this comprehensive power to consider -- to be able to protect conservation in regard to direct sales to industry and suspension of rates on indirect sales.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="1552.707" offset="6314193">That's right, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.064" offset="6323597">And indirect sales where they can't suspend it, even though there is a certificate and they go under Section 5 for a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.073" offset="6359646">So that, the Commission was explicit about this, then time after time, they have taken a similar position and they have reported the various cases they've taken, the fact that they asserted the right to consider the end use of the product in regard to inferior and superior uses of gas and made a claim that they considered boiler fuel as the Federal Trade Commission had said, an inferior use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.574" offset="6477720">Now, the practices of the Commission were that they did allow certificates for boiler fuel in various situations and those are set out in detail in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.192" offset="6528188">But there had to be a special justification for the use, this inferior use, or they would not allow it and some of the special justification was in a Transco case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.035" offset="6583463">Transco, in its earlier applications, made justification showing that they needed the right to sell for industrial purposes in order to bring the rates down to their resales to other consumers, because of the lack of volume during their valley periods or their low periods in regard to resalable gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.828" offset="6686699">And therefore, they justified on that basis, but even then, the Commission said to the time after time, you should get busy and establish some storage, so you don't have to sell all this gas for this inferior purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.230" offset="6748244">But you can put it in storage during your valley periods and then sell it out during the peak periods, sold to the consumers for the highest use, and therefore, conserve the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.374" offset="6800906">And they pressured Transco time after time on that and finally in this application for the first time, Transco has come forward with what was called the Leidy Storage Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.586" offset="6849703">Now, this proposal is damaging to that project amongst other things, because it doesn't conceive that this particular gas that they will get during the 60-day peaking period or during the other period that they use this part of the pipeline which is the valley period, will go into the Leidy reservoir, but it'll be used for the special advantage of Consolidated Edison under this X-20 tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.149" offset="6975927">But the Commission had insisted constantly as one example of their position that Transco get more into the storage business for the conservation of gas and it finally come around to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.891" offset="7042905">Now, they'd also allowed it for the atomic energy plant at Oak Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.926" offset="7063071">They've allowed it for other installations where they needed to raise the amount of their volume, so as to reduce the price of the gas generally to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.669" offset="7122004">They had allowed it for special industrial purposes, where it was shown that the gas, itself, would form chemical compound or help in that regard with the -- in the manufacture and so had a contribution other than just the use for the purpose of producing steam, which is a low value use as far as the amount of return from the Btus in it, and each of those situations we have analyzed at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.730" offset="7270275">Now in regard to the legislative history, there's also expressed specific examples where the congressmen had come forward with the proposal to prohibit the Commission from considering end use, four different times and the Congress had not yet allowed it.</text>
