            <text syncTime="15.119" offset="163819">This case is here on the pleadings to review dismissal of petitioner's complaint by the District Court for failure to state a cause of action and the affirmance of that dismissal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.941" offset="231111">Petitioner seeks in this action to recover treble damages and to obtain injunctive relief against respondents from respondents by virtue of their alleged violations of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.851" offset="286804">The petitioner is a small manufacturer of ceramic gas burners which are used in the space heating of homes and industrial and commercial facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.480" offset="341243">The complaint charges that petitioner has been prevented from selling its product in interstate commerce by a horizontal and vertical conspiracy consisting of the respondent, American Gas Association or AGA and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.753" offset="418356">Now, the membership of this trade association, the AGA, includes hundreds of petitioner's direct competitors, that is, manufacturers of competing gas burners.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.405" offset="473004">It includes gas pipeline companies and it includes all or practically all of the gas public utilities in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.327" offset="512711">According to the complaint, petitioner has been excluded from the market by a device called the AGA approval plan and the AGA seal of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.672" offset="562030">It works like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.835" offset="570702">A committee of the AGA which includes among its membership petitioner's competitors has established standards for the granting or denial of this AGA seal of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.304" offset="628590">All of the competitors who sit on this Committee make burners of metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.207" offset="652204">The standards which they have established require that only metal burners may be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.934" offset="683133">The petitioner's burner has twice been submitted to the AGA, twice, the AGA has rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.930" offset="719078">Now, the complaint alleges that the standards which this Committee establishes are not objective standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.670" offset="754082">And this is, of course, admitted for the purposes of this argument by respondent's motion to dismiss and in any event, the respondent, AGA, argues in its brief before this Court that the standards need not be objective and as a matter of fact, they argue that the standards need not even be valid standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.896" offset="838928">This denial of the seal of approval to petitioner's burner is only the horizontal aspect of this conspiracy which we have charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.384" offset="884903">After the seal of approval was denied to petitioner, the vertical component was brought into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="657.429" offset="2733119">Now, this is particularly true in Illinois because in Illinois, there are over, to this date, there are over 200,000 persons waiting for a permit from the gas company to install gas space heating.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.897" offset="2791006">So the gas company, which issues a permit to install gas space heating, is in direct contact with the customer at the time that the customer is ready to buy a gas burner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.313" offset="5272639">And they took their definition of boycott from their reading of the Klor's case from the Fashion Originators' Guild case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.777" offset="5366471">That direct refusal element being absent here, the Court of Appeals summarily in one paragraph discarded Klor's, discarded Fashion Originators' and said there was no per se violation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.490" offset="5421328">Next, they went through the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.272" offset="5436479">And here, they said that petitioner had not stated the cause of action and that as a matter of fact, it was not even open to petitioner under the complaint to prove the unreasonableness under the circumstances because there is no allegation in the complaint that the AGA did not have a good reason for denying the seal of approval, in other words, that there was no allegation in their view that the seal was denied arbitrarily and capriciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.042" offset="5551522">And this -- this was the extent of their inquiry under the rule of reason.Finally, the Court of Appeals said there was no cause of action here because the complaint failed to allege injury to the public in the form, and I think this important, in the form of an appreciable lessening in the sale of conversion gas burners or that the public has been deprived of a product of overall superiority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.786" offset="5686523">In other words, no public injury because we didn't say that our product was not merely as good as but overall superior to all the other products on the market, and we didn't have a cause of action because there was no appreciable lessening in the sale of gas burners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.597" offset="7497749">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.549" offset="7517602">The interest of the Government in this case is with the holding that the complaint did not state a cause of action because it did not show injury to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.999" offset="7575385">On the particular facts here, this means that a powerful group can combine to keep a product off the market and yet have no violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.800" offset="7630555">And they said they've shown that the total volume of sales the public has been induced or that the excluded product is a superior product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.540" offset="7681546">I believe that this is not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.874" offset="7698892">At the 1956 term in Radovich, the Court held there could be error to dismiss a complaint for failure to allege public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.721" offset="7746226">And of course, at the 1958 term, it held that whether there was a conspiracy to keep a retail store from obtaining goods of certain leading manufactures, this was a restraint of such monopolistic tendency that it came within the prohibitions of the Act, and that it was immaterial that was no charge or proof that it was in effect on the quantity, or quality, or price of goods sold to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.292" offset="7908498">In the Fashion Originators' Guild case in 312 U.S., an agreement to keep from out of trade, garments which embody pirated original designs was held to violate the Act, not withstanding, no showing that this conspiracy regulated prices or that it allocated or limited production have brought about a deterioration in the quality of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.321" offset="8048619">The Court said that these categories did not exhaust the types of conduct then by the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.375" offset="8084877">The court below said that this -- that Klor's and Fashion Originators' Guild involve per se -- restraints per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.379" offset="8132838">And that they eliminated the necessity of showing public injury only as to such restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.890" offset="8170977">In these cases, the Court did not attach the label per se to the restraints which it held unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.339" offset="8208697">My view of the decisions is that the Court regarded them as involving restraints of -- restraints on competition of a degree in character that made them unreasonable irrespective of whether they fell within the classification of per se restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.839" offset="8318725">And that, if this is true, these are holdings that public injury does not -- is not an essential element in a complaint or in the proof of a restraint which is not per se unreasonable but whether this maybe debatable whether the decision below is in conflict with the actual holdings in Fashion Originators' and Klor's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.714" offset="8446203">But the conflict with Radovich seems to me certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.871" offset="8470862">There, the Court held that it was not necessary to allege public injury and it treated the restraint as being not per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.045" offset="8523525">It said that it need be treated only under the general prohibition -- under the Sherman Act's general prohibition on unreasonable restraints of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.246" offset="8572322">It cited for this general prohibition the Times-Picayune case where the restraint was not per se illegal, it was in fact held legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.347" offset="8628746">The Court in Radovich said, “Congress has by legislative fiat determined that such prohibited activities are injurious to the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.343" offset="8680782">In other words, that any restraint that comes within the Act's prohibitions does involve detriment to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.458" offset="8737207">The very fact the prohibition establishes the view that Congress regarded that as against public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.939" offset="8787153">It is not necessary to prove in addition to violation that the defendant's particular violation has defeated the ultimate public objectives of the statute, ultimate ends that the statute was designed to serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="2218.570" offset="8977638">Now, the decision below in this case, a decision by United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, of Ritz (ph) case which our brief cites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.659" offset="9033958">And I think the decision of the Court of Appeals in the Klor's case show that lower federal courts still believe that public injury must be shown in every Section 1, Sherman Act proceeding not involving restraint per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.694" offset="9122147">I believe the lower courts will continue to enforce this requirement because it provides an easy doctrine of a basis for disposing of Sherman Act cases which otherwise might require careful analysis of the facts in relation to -- to decide the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.970" offset="9207202">And only a decision by this Court which explicitly holds that public injury does not have to be shown, whether the restraint is per se illegal or not by putting in to dismissal of Sherman Act cases from the basis of lack of showing of public injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.194" offset="9288182">Grant of certiorari in this case would seem to indicate that it was regarded as presenting a question of federal law of general importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.872" offset="9342830">There would be no such question decided if this Court merely holds that the allocations in fact show a restraint per se illegal or that they sufficiently allege public injury or that in a Sherman Act proceeding, it's enough merely to allege that the restraint is unreasonable or to the injury of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.324" offset="9460694">The necessity of showing public injury is presented here as a pleading question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.565" offset="9485667">But the much more important and underlying question is one of substantive law, that is, the elements which is essential to show to establish that restraint not per se illegal is in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.535" offset="9569468">This is so because whatever it is necessary to allege, it is necessary to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.482" offset="9597262">The brief of Parmelee Transportation Company illustrates this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.529" offset="9633520">The complaint which it filed charged a conspiracy to exclude it from performing certain transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.750" offset="9670405">The District Court on the authority of the Radiant Burners decision in the court below required, ordered preliminary separate trial of the question whether this conspiracy injured the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.856" offset="9730800">And it put the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of proof that because of the conspiracy, the service to the public had been appreciably lessened or it had been deprived as superior service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.403" offset="9808959">Under the concept of substantive law of the court below, present petitioner if it ever -- if the case -- when the case came to trial, would have an impossible burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.786" offset="9870503">Assume that this conspiracy to keep off the market every burner that does not have the association seal of approval is a 100% successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.678" offset="9934033">Public has been able to buy all the burners if it wished to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.832" offset="9954722">How can it be shown that the conspiracy has lessened, appreciably lessened the sale of burners?</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.491" offset="9993383">How can it be shown that it has been deprived of a product of overall superiority?</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.138" offset="10023894">Perhaps superiority means superiority regardless of price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.776" offset="10046464">Perhaps it means superior value per dollar of purchase price or perhaps it means that the plaintiff would have to show that his burner is superior to each and every one of the burners available to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.970" offset="10111248">In any event, it has to be court and jury determination of technical, mechanical engineering questions probably presented on conflicting expert opinion testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.787" offset="10178539">There'll be an injection of another issue in antitrust proceedings which -- as the Court knows unfortunately, frequently are very long and protracted as well as expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.429" offset="10233083">Now, except for the Ritz (ph) case which was decided last year, this doctrine of -- required a showing that public injury has been applied only in private actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.621" offset="10285850">If this is requisite in private actions, it is requisite in -- probably in Sherman Act proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.102" offset="10315734">Violation of the statute is the basis of suit in either type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.481" offset="10341334">And the elements necessary to show violation have to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.540" offset="10373517">Yet, there have been a great number of Government cases involving restraints which the Court did not treat as per se illegal, which have been held unlawful without any discussion of the question whether it has been a showing of the kind of public injury referred to by the court below, without any discussion of whether such a showing is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.709" offset="10490232">This is the body of law which at least sub silentio, indicates that this is not a required element in --</text>

            <text syncTime="2907.386" offset="11732929">Now, the respondents urge that where a restraint is not per se illegal, then in order to show that it comes within the statute, you have to show that it has certain adverse effects on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.468" offset="11821223">And they mentioned statements made by this Court from time to time that the purpose of the Act or one of the purposes was to protect the public against -- and has been of prices curtailing production, deterioration of quality goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.119" offset="11887888">They say that this requirement of showing of public injury is a verbalization or a reformulation of rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.529" offset="11941491">I submit that this contention is an error because it dissimilates the benefits to the public thought to -- and so by and large in the long run by prohibiting anti-competitive and monopolistic combinations that the prohibitions themselves attest the application and scope of these prohibitions as the effect on competition of the acts which is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.459" offset="12077223">This is the very meaning of the words “restraint of trade”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.096" offset="12095718">Test is not whether the act's directly and immediately and demonstrably produce these effects on the public which the statute have the general purpose of preventing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.728" offset="12158307">This Court has consistently held that the touchstone to the unreasonableness of a restraint of trade to the extent to which -- in the manner in which it affected competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.540" offset="12213582">The Chicago Board of Trade case in 246 U.S. is referred to press more frequently than any other by antitrust defendants who assert that the restraints of which they are charged are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.673" offset="12274082">The Court in that case as in other cases made the effect on competition, the key to the scope of what was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.373" offset="12332910">Court said at page 238, “The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.909" offset="12415039">In the recent Northern Pacific case, the Court said that the Sherman Act was designed, reserved, free and unfettered competition as the law of trade.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.521" offset="12457462">It said that the Act rests on the premise that the free-play of competitive forces would yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.809" offset="12534575">Plainly, an antitrust plaintiff does not have to prove what is incapable of proof that the defendants' acts have interfered with or prevented the best allocation of the nation's economic resources or the greatest material progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.608" offset="12621824">All that need be shown is that the restraint significantly interferes with the free interaction of competitive forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.190" offset="12672084">I'll mention just one other consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.170" offset="12688071">Price enhancement is a public evil most commonly and most directly considered to be the -- to result from anti-competitive and monos -- monopolistic combinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.628" offset="12757870">And price-fixing agreements are unlawful per se, but regardless of whether they enhance price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.428" offset="12801128">The prohibited agreements include those to fix price ceilings and it is irrelevant in the case of these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.714" offset="12838222">What the actual effect on price was, that was the holding first in Trenton Potteries and in great number of following cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.748" offset="12878346">The agreements are outlawed per se because they strike at the very core of commercial competition, that is price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.534" offset="12921501">The determining consideration is not effect on the public but the effect on competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.166" offset="12988061">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.136" offset="13011884">I appear for the respondent, the American Gas Association Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.187" offset="13056084">It's alleged to be a membership corporation organized on the laws of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.266" offset="13080430">It follows I think that you can safely assume, as a matter of law, it's not engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.951" offset="13119195">The alleged illegal conspiracy in combination that is attempted to be stated in this complaint is said in paragraph (4) to be revolving around membership in the American Gas Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.366" offset="13208848">And I think that we can take it that there isn't a thing that alleged constituting an illegal conspiracy, combination, agreement, combination in the form of trust or otherwise except the membership in the American Gas Association and the acts of the American Gas Association that are involved in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.790" offset="13306546">And I think the only useful function that I can serve to this Court is to go through this complain briefly and show you that this is the case, Your Honors, where the plaintiff has pleaded so much when it comes to the precise particular facts, he's pleaded himself out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.983" offset="13399333">And the decisions below, three times in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals came to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.130" offset="13455862">Now, the only business so called that the American Gas Association is alleged to do is to send its inspectors systematically into the Northern District of Illinois to inspect the products of manufactures of gas equipments whose products have been approved and listed by AGA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.128" offset="13547917">That's in paragraph (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.330" offset="13560665">The plaintiff here is a corporation organized under the laws of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.484" offset="13581354">There is no allegation it's a small corporation or a large corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.470" offset="13601207">It's a corporation, and there is no fact, no basis for saying what its size is or is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.435" offset="13645093">There were also named as defendants here, gas utilities, manufacturers, pipe line companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.991" offset="13683336">And there are references to the statistics that are published, I refer on R6 for example, that have been published from time to time by the American Gas Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.303" offset="13736626">And there, the standard is reliably estimated by the defendant AGA between the years 1960 and 1974, were 42 million space heaters, 17 million floor and wall furnaces and 19 million central heating units, including replacements, will be installed in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.104" offset="13815829">We're talking therefore on the basis of what AGA has compiled and what AGA has done as a public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.976" offset="13851251">To inform the public regarding this industry and I think I can safely say its acts are devoted to promoting the gas industry in this great country of ours.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.257" offset="14032436">Now, there is an allegation in -- in very conclusory terms of controlling the manufacture, sale and use and installation of gas burners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.859" offset="14078830">General language concededly is in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.606" offset="14097847">But I submit there are also specific allegations to which I'll refer in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.190" offset="14124178">Now, one of the first factual allegations regarding American Gas Association is on page 6, at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.101" offset="14159809">The defendant AGA has laboratories in Cleveland, Ohio and Los Angeles, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.611" offset="14189798">Each of which, he uses the words “purport” in speaking of the facts, concede the facts, to test the utility, durability and safety of gas burners and gas equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.696" offset="14246118">And I'd like to pause right there and turn, if may, to page 9 and say that the plaintiff has also alleged in paragraph (8) in his purported injury to the public allegation, saying that AGA purports to approve only products which are safe, substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.009" offset="14335457">And I express the word here "substantial, durable, and efficient", and I'll come to the remainder of that in a moment, if I may, in good order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.408" offset="14381014">But I do think it -- it should be mentioned here because we are dealing, I think, in large part with this characteristic of the substantiality of the Radiant Burner, as I shall endeavor to develop in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.889" offset="14450918">Now, the next paragraph on page 7 merely alleges that defendant gas burner and equipment manufacturers, some of which are in competition with the plaintiff along with the utilities and the Peoples Gas are -- or have been represented on the Committee of AGA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.297" offset="14540570">It is not true, as my adversary endeavored to point out to you, that the competitors control the acts of AGA in these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.819" offset="14586650">There isn't any allegation of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.568" offset="14597622">The most that can be said and the fact that we concede is that they are represented on the Committee and that's perfectly proper thing to have the representatives of people who manufacture these products participate as manufacturers on the AGA Committee which decides whether or not gas burners and equipment wore an AGA approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.052" offset="14699604">But there isn't any allegation anywhere in this complaint that they control each and every test, in each or every decision and each and every approval or failure to give approval by these two gas laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.085" offset="14775672">Now, there, it's alleged there the power to influence on the part of utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.992" offset="14807333">But again, let's keep in mind that this is a combination involving membership in AGA and what AGA does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.956" offset="14843173">But I think paragraph (d) on page 7 has some significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.465" offset="14861249">There, it is alleged by this petitioner, it is not possible to successfully sell, market and distribute gas equipment including radiant burners, manufactured by plaintiff, which are not approved by AGA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.201" offset="14936168">Well, I think we can take it as a reasonable inference that the petitioner is in commerce that it does sell what it would like to sell more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.752" offset="14982353">It would like to sell it so that it can regard itself as successfully selling and marketing its product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.938" offset="15019133">Then it continues because we effectuate the plan and the purpose of this unlawful combination, which I have already referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.525" offset="15057481">Now, the refusal to provide gas is, of course, something which no one here can absolutely control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.543" offset="15089560">The utilities are as I think has been indicated by the questioning from the bench subject to the Public Utility Commission to their various States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.431" offset="15125086">And if the costumers denied service, his grievance, of course, is to go to his commission, state the facts and the Commission will deal with the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3813.575" offset="15357680">Let's take its entirety, by refusing to provide gas for use in plaintiff Radiant Burner and other gas heating devices and equipment produced by other manufacturers, which are not approved by AGA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.545" offset="15405537">There is the -- that's the whole paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.919" offset="15419016">Now, we're going to come to in a little moment about this approval by AGA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.044" offset="15447542">It is alleged further along that we have endeavored the AGA and utilities on the next page to use municipalities and other government agencies to pass ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.558" offset="15493622">There was a question about that from the bench and require that no equipment shall be used within its limits unless that gas burner equipment bears the seal of approval of AGA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.852" offset="15542732">And there's a further specific illustration given later in the complaint about the experience up in Milwaukee where the -- that's on page 15, sirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.197" offset="15588185">The reference was, "It violated a city ordinance which provided that no gas burner could be used other than those approved by AGA or equal."</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.164" offset="15627995">In other words, it could have been some other laboratory or some other standard provided it was equal to those established by AGA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.711" offset="15678255">I want to continue on the various matters that are the manner of -- of carrying out this unlawful combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.111" offset="15727783">I've referred to one that I think is the significant act so far as to fix my client the laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.203" offset="15756204">And it is said there that the tests made by AGA are not based on valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.181" offset="15792044">Well, what is valid?</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.076" offset="15795702">Maybe difference of opinion on varying -- this whole industry is changing all the while, objectives standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.843" offset="15830706">I'll show you in a moment, Your Honor, that by the affirmance of this complaint certainly, one objective standard is alleged in this complaint, namely, that the appliances that are approved by AGA are metal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.367" offset="15896848">And the plaintiff's burner is of ceramic material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.967" offset="15923284">Now, I think I could pause here to say that ceramic is defined in the dictionary as pertaining to pottery, the art of molding, modeling and baking in clay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.666" offset="15974066">So, you have here a very definite specific factual allegation of an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.842" offset="16010742">And that is shown -- I'll jump around to fit in this complaint, and I'm doing it to save time, but to come to what I think is the heart of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.963" offset="16063195">The alleged injury to the public is that AGA purports to approve only products which are safe, substantially durable and efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.467" offset="16097259">And then it's alleged, plaintiff has tendered the radiant burners to AGA for approval on two occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.024" offset="16143444">And AGA has not approved such radiant burner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.259" offset="16164446">For now, I think it's reasonable to assume that something must have been said in the first -- as a result of the first test that induced the Radiant to try a second test which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.064" offset="16227662">But the complaint doesn't tell you one word, not a sound is uttered in this complaint about what was said in these reports of the test made in these laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.614" offset="16277817">They were left completely in the dark about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.655" offset="16294013">Now, I say that if he was induced to make a second try, there isn't any reason why he should make a third try or other tries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.293" offset="16348557">AGA -- there isn't anything in fact showed here that it denied its laboratory to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.089" offset="16383770">Thus, the plaintiff voluntarily came to its doors and asked for its test, and it was not refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.124" offset="16415848">There's no allegation that anyone has ever been refused the tests by AGA and its laboratories.</text>
