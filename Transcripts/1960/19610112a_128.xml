            <text syncTime="23.300" offset="196524">Apparently, petitioner accepts this characterization of the facts since yesterday, you'd not argue the position of his brief if one general course of conduct was involved but instead he maintained the considerably more extreme position that one automobile means one offense no matter how unrelated the acts concerning this automobile may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.982" offset="283251">Now, turning to the indictment which is on pages 2 to 4 of the record, Count 3 of the indictment which is the concealment count, alleges that at particular Ford automobile was stolen in Lake City, Florida on January 19th, 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.629" offset="357857">It further alleges that between January 19th and February 13th, 1941, petitioner and his two codefendants received, concealed and stored the same automobile in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.352" offset="412818">And it further alleges that the automobile at that time of the concealment was then and their moving as was a part of and constituted interstate commerce from Lake City in the State of Florida to Owen County near Frankfort, Kentucky.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.332" offset="820746">Count 2 alleges that petitioner's two codefendants transported the same automobile on February 12th from Atlanta, Georgia to Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.343" offset="860766">Now, since on or about January 19th, the automobile was in Kentucky and since he moved from Georgia to Kentucky on February 12th, it is clear that sometime between January 19th and February 12th, the car was moved from Kentucky to Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.730" offset="934327">Now, whether it was by -- moved by petitioner or by someone else, is again not clear from the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.416" offset="957001">So -- so that for all the indictment shows, the possession of the car may not have even been in continuous possession of petitioner or his two codefendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.798" offset="998588">Therefore, the -- the facts of this case are that the acts of concealment alleged in Count 3, were not only in tied in the indictment to a transportation which was not alleged as an offense in the indictment, but an additional transportation, which was not alleged as an offense in the indictment, occurred between the acts of concealment, the beginning of the acts of concealment and the transportation which was charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.680" offset="1522082">In short, as we read the indictment, the facts of this case so that the acts of concealment and the acts of transportation which were alleged, were separate and entirely unrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.667" offset="1566072">This is suggested very strongly in the indictment, but this is especially true, since we believe that under well-established rules of law, this indictment must be construed in the way which is most favorable for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.582" offset="1617690">It's, of course, a familiar principle that a final judgment is presumed to be correct and that the burden is on the person attacking that judgment to show the facts supporting his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.958" offset="1659173">Now, your petitioner pleaded guilty and thereby removed the necessity for the Government to prove the facts underlying the indictment and he admitted his separate guilt on the two separate counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.800" offset="1710582">And at the same time, he made the indictment, the sole relevant fact when he made this collateral attack, 18 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.313" offset="1740675">Therefore, we believe that insofar as the indictment is ambiguous, petitioner has failed to sustain his burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="726.657" offset="3010017">And on January 19th, petitioner and his codefendants, either themselves transported the automobile from Florida or received it in Kentucky from persons who did transport it.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.098" offset="3055783">That on that some -- same day or shortly thereafter, petitioner and his codefendants engaged in acts of concealing the automobile, such as changing the motor numbers or repainting the car or similar such acts, which have been held in other cases to constitute acts of concealment under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.873" offset="3122866">And sometime later, perhaps some three weeks, either petitioner and his codefendants or someone else, transported this automobile from Kentucky to Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.843" offset="3158706">And we can -- and we can properly assume that the purpose of the return trip from which petitioner and his codefendants transported the automobile from Georgia to Kentucky, was not for the same purpose as the original concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.904" offset="3206980">For example, it may have been to go visit friends, go on legitimate business or even they commit another crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.314" offset="3240626">If this case is considered on these facts, which we emphasized that it must be, we feel that there is -- there were clearly two separate offenses which are separately punishable under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.276" offset="3284511">We feel that it's clear that if a person transports the same automobile across state lines and then three and a half weeks later, an entirely different criminal impulsive for a different purpose, he repeats the same act that there would clearly be two separate violations of Section 3 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.147" offset="3352012">We can see no difference when the person commits acts of concealment, violating Section 4 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.919" offset="3375000">And then three and a half weeks later, for an entirely different purpose and entirely different criminal impulse, he violates Section 3 by transporting the automobile across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.115" offset="3419826">Now, we think that the rule of lenity clearly does not apply in this situation then none of the case is decided by this Court composed to even suggesting that there -- there is only offense involved here or might to delay discussion of the cases applying the rule until after he discussed petitioner's contention, which he makes in his brief and the general course of conduct is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.831" offset="3514702">Since as we've persist, I hope to show that the rule of lenity would not apply even if the general course of conduct were involved and for sure, it would not apply if the acts were entirely separate and unrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.900" offset="3571022">Assuming the petitioner is correct and then the general course of conduct were involved, I -- I take it that this would mean that there is a single general course of conduct relating to the same automobile from January 19th to February 13th, and this is the only possible construction of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.038" offset="3647509">The most that a general course of conduct to mean in this context is that a single criminal impulse and a single criminal purpose underlay both of the acts of concealment and the acts of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.026" offset="3703515">It would be consistent with this view of the facts for example, for petitioner and his codefendants to have intended on January 19th to conceal the automobile for purposes of sale and to have taken the trip to Georgia for that purpose and perhaps it was unsuccessful to return to Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.416" offset="3777076">But we think that even under that -- that group of facts, assuming that would -- that were the case before this Court that the rule of lenity does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.184" offset="3824097">I would like to discuss in order of the cases which petitioner has cited and which this Court has applied the rule of lenity to -- in order to forbid consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.945" offset="3875192">In Bell versus the United States, which of course involved the transportation of two women for immoral purposes across state lines on the same trip, in the same automobile at the same time, therefore, the very same act of transporting the -- of one woman also transported the other woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.207" offset="3944155">Certain at the least, a common transaction was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.466" offset="3961187">In fact, the Court defined a rule of lenity in the Bell case, as a rule and I quote, "Against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses, unless the intent of Congress is clear."</text>
            <text syncTime="977.490" offset="4013328">Now, in the Ladner case which petitioner also cites, person -- is all that two federal officers while under arrest, perhaps arguendo and the -- in the facts before the Court by a single discharge of a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.361" offset="4068812">Now, obviously, this is a single act in the narrowest physical sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.124" offset="4115832">In the Prince v. United States which involved the Federal Bank Robbery Act, this Court held that -- that a person couldn't be punished both for entry into the bank with intent to rob it and for the completed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.557" offset="4165569">But not only did this involve what the Court called, a narrow question of the unique statue of limited purpose, but the factual situation is clearly again, one were both defenses are a part of the single continuous transaction within a very short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.061" offset="4231607">The case in which petitioner principally relied in his brief is the Heflin case, which also involved the Federal Bank Robbery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.159" offset="4267969">Either the Court held that bank robbery could not be separately punished for receiving money, he had helped to steal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.467" offset="4301197">Again, we think the Court was considering a continuous after transaction which was intimately related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.003" offset="4331395">And in fact Justice Douglas speaking for the Court specifically stated that the issue before the Court was the intent of Congress in punishing multiple aspects of the same criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.525" offset="4381445">The petitioner is suggested in his brief that Heflin was considered by the majority of this Court under Rule 35 and therefore only the indictment was before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.412" offset="4428988">The indictment there is not too dissimilar in the -- in the concealment count to the -- to Count 3 of the indictment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.492" offset="4461380">They were to allege receipt, concealment, storage and other -- and other similar words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.996" offset="4487398">Petitioner therefore suggested in Heflin as here, if the indictment where construed in the manner most favorable for the Government, totally separate acts of bank robbery and concealment, would have been involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.147" offset="4543927">But we submit to the Heflin, well, this Court could not construe the indictment in the manner most favorable for the Government, since a transcript of the trial was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.657" offset="4581961">It certainly would have been strange for this Court to construe the indictment most favorably for the Government in direct opposition to the facts which the Court knew to be truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.427" offset="4621040">In fact, the Government urged there and it cited the transcript that the only facts there which were -- the only acts by the petitioner there, which were separate from the robbery, was the dividing up of the loot and -- which lose immediately after the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.778" offset="4682480">And no claim was made for the Government that sometime later, separate acts of concealment unrelated to the robbery were armed -- were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.918" offset="4715081">The Government's contention of separateness was the acts were physically separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.871" offset="4738905">And in fact, the Court likewise, considered only the acts of dividing up the loot in its opinion and -- and decided that they were part of the same criminal act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.408" offset="5680985">Here, we think that there was no -- there was no such interrelationship and time itself, makes a difference we think, that if a person that -- that contrary to what petitioner argues, that if a person still transports a car today, keeps the automobile and transports it across state lines two years from now, that these -- these are in no -- in no way the same criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.915" offset="5771055">And so we think time doesn't make a difference and the three and a half weeks itself makes a significant difference in the case between the one that you post to me in the -- in the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.209" offset="5816195">But in addition, construing the statute, we have an intermediate transportation which may have nothing to do with petitioner and his two codefendants and we may at well have entirely different criminal purposes and impulses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.936" offset="5883068">Briefly, we also think that the Universal C.I.T. Credit Corporation case is also very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.940" offset="5907101">There, the Court did speak of a course of conduct but we like to emphasize that the course of conduct there was under each different criminal provision that was a separate course of conduct which this Court held, was separately punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.113" offset="5959868">If we apply the same kind of reasoning to this case, then -- then a person transports the same automobile twice couldn't be convicted twice no matter how much the separation in time, but that wouldn't at all apply to the facts of this case that would -- it would be a separate course of conduct for concealment, receipt and storage and there would be a course of conduct for transportation and each one of those would be separately punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.010" offset="6063417">Finally Your Honors, petitioners argue that a person using a -- a stolen automobile over a long period of time, may cross numerous state lines and therefore, maybe guilty of multiple offenses under the Government's theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.940" offset="6295176">Petitioner would say that the indictment charges that in the third count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.672" offset="6314088">The petitioner's codefendants received, concealed and stored the automobile between the 19th day of January and the 13th day of February.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.993" offset="6355362">Second count charged that they transported it on the 12th day of February.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.266" offset="6372394">Therefore, the petitioner thinks that it's fair to assume from this indictment that petitioner and his codefendants had possession of the car from whatever point at which they received it to and including the period of transportation, because the transportation and his charge is in the middle of the period in which he was charged that they received concealment stored.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.346" offset="6596733">I suspect that in dealing with this problem perhaps, the Court is as well off to have no other facts than it has because I'm not sure there's any stocking place, between saying, this statute meant to get that separate persons who were involved in varying ways with respect to a stolen car and saying on the other extreme, that criminality here becomes a factor of time and distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.419" offset="6705089">And that the more time that elapses, the more things that a person does with the car, the more possible counts that may be charged against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.088" offset="6735705">And I suggest here that generally and this is a special kind of statute, generally, we don't calculate criminality in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.249" offset="6764335">Certainly in the field of larceny generally, the man's punishment doesn't rise with the length of time that we hold on to the stolen -- or stolen article, or with the number of things he does with the stolen article before the time in which he's caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.173" offset="6816057">These were all regarded as part and -- of the necessary incidence of effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.294" offset="6836537">Now true, we're not dealing with a larceny statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.357" offset="6848763">We're not dealing with the larceny statute only because Congress didn't have the constitutional authority to make a larceny statute, so they made it to transportation statute and tied it in here, really assisting the States in the enforcement of their own law here not any separate federal interest basically beyond that, assisting the States in enforcing their larceny law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.060" offset="6943640">We accept the Government's contention, the man who steals the car and keeps it within the State where he steals it, probably will get under most state laws the time whereof one charge, one sentence or whatever the local sentences for larceny of automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.338" offset="7008737">No matter how long it keeps it, no matter what he does with it or how many crimes he commits, committed or what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.728" offset="7034232">This was an incident, but here once he go across the state line, the Government's argument now and they make it quite clearly certainly on page 13 of their brief that the longer he keeps the car, the more things he does with it, the more places he drives it and so on, the more crimes, potential crimes he's creating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.873" offset="7110823">All I suggest is doubtful that Congress intended to give to courts the discretion to impose what could be an obviously enormously large sentences for this offense, under -- under this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.387" offset="7168920">And beyond that, it seems to me that with respect to the application of the prior cases, I suggest that the Government's construction here is somewhat narrow, that the rule of lenity as I read it, as this Court has adopted it, is a part of the general rule with statutory construction.</text>
