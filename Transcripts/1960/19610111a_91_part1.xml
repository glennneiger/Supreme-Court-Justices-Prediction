            <label>Mr. S. Hazard Gillespie, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="25.826" offset="206660">Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.803" offset="230588">In this case, the Government appeals by direct appeal from the oral ruling of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, dismissing an indictment on motion before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.910" offset="295058">The indictment which is in the record is in two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.919" offset="311045">Charges in the first count that all of the defendants except the defendant Dave Beck were employers of employees in an industry affecting commerce and unlawfully paid and delivered and agreed to pay and deliver to Dave Beck, President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a representative of the employees mentioned, a thing of value to wit money in the amount of $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.233" offset="436328">The second count charges that the defendant Dave Beck received and accepted and agreed to receive and accept a thing of value, to wit, this money, in the amount of $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.889" offset="494947">The close of each count, it is stated that the acts alleged in the respective counts, constitute a violation of Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act, which specifically makes it "unlawful” for any employer to pay or deliver or to agree to pay or deliver any money or other thing of value to any representative of any of his employees who are employed in an industry affecting commerce."</text>
            <text syncTime="128.839" offset="618768">The statute also makes it a crime to accept or receive money or thing -- other thing of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.241" offset="656384">Just prior to the trial of this case in the District Court, the Government filed a memorandum with the trial judge in which the Government acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.388" offset="696926">What is the fact that this payment and delivery to Beck of $200,000 was made to him as a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.319" offset="740603">The District Court, treating the memorandum as a judicial admission, ruled that since the payment and delivery and the receipt and acceptance of the $200,000 were on a loan basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.564" offset="809671">The statue was not violated and there was no offense as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.447" offset="833181">It is from this ruling of the District Court that this appeal is prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.602" offset="853765">Motions to affirm were made in this Court at the early brief and probable jurisdiction was noted on October 10 of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.685" offset="894098">In our submission, the District Court ruling is error.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.136" offset="911966">The plain language of the section prohibits any payments or delivery of money to a representative of employees except those expressly authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.456" offset="957210">The purpose and the context of the Section, we believe accord with this literal meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.405" offset="985004">And the legislative history shows the intent of Congress to prohibit all financial dealings except those specifically authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.121" offset="1023875">Now, I will expend on each of those three points briefly and then deal whether -- with what I understand to be the two principle contentions of the appellees which are as follows, as I understand them.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.536" offset="1073507">First, the appellees contend that an amendment of the statute in 1959, in the Kennedy Urbandale -- Urbandale which included among other things adding the term "lend" to the prohibitions already extant against paying or delivering money.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.419" offset="1157099">Evidence's, Congress' own understanding that the statutory prohibition had not theretofore included alone, and then, their second contention as I understand it that to construe the statutory prohibition in the earlier legislation of which was against paying or delivering money as including a prohibition against paying or delivering on loan, would deprive the accused of that unequivocal warning which every criminal statute should convey.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.214" offset="1288234">As I said, I'll -- the converse of this second proposition of the appellees is the Government's first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.711" offset="1326268">We insist, respectfully, that the plain language of the statute as enacted in 1947, made it lawful or unlawful for an employer to pay or deliver "any money or other thing of value to a representative of his employees as well as the receipt or acceptance thereof by the representative”.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.135" offset="1435878">Now, deliver, which is the term of the statute according to the dictionary meaning, is to give or transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.078" offset="1463672">Receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.811" offset="1466598">Again, according to the dictionary meaning is to take something that is offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.738" offset="1486346">As we see it, every loan contemplates or has as an essential element, transfer, delivery and acceptance of the matter alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.644" offset="1541935">When an employer makes a loan of $200,000 to a representative, he, to paraphrase the statute, pays or delivers money to the representative and then latter receives or accepts money from the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.808" offset="1678608">I think that may bear on the subject of whether this was in other thing of value but it sees the position of the Government that the payment or delivery of money at the outset was a square violation of the clear provisions of the statute and no matter what the interest rate might be, there would be a violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.127" offset="3267897">Well, this Court previously on both the Ryan case and the Arroyo case as we see it has ascribed their literal meaning to other terms used in Section 302.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.210" offset="3332263">In the first of these cases, that is the Ryan case, the Court concluded as Your Honors will remember that the term in the statute representative of employees included the president of the union as well as the union itself even though by contract, the union was turned to the exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.062" offset="3415646">And so doing, the opinion stated as the statute reads, "It appears to be a criminal provision malum prohibitum, which outlaws all payments with stated exceptions between the employer and representative."</text>
            <text syncTime="845.018" offset="3483460">And then in the Arroyo case which of course followed by some years, the Ryan case, while the majority of the Court held against the Government's prosecution by deciding that one of the exceptions to the prohibitions of this Section had been precisely followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.344" offset="3552737">The opinion noted in connection with the statute as a whole that a literal construction of this statute does no violence to common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.839" offset="3594742">Now, we ask no other consideration here than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.885" offset="3610937">That the language of this statute be followed precisely and that the 1454 delivery of this money as the first step in this loan, fell squarely within its prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.248" offset="3656391">As of course, this Court knows, Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 was enacted as a part of a comprehensive revision of federal labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.104" offset="3707800">In the light of experience, came under the Wagner Act and was aimed to practices which Congress considered destructive of the integrity of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.926" offset="3747088">One way in -- in which Congress sort to preserve and protect that integrity was by outlawing all unauthorized payments between employers and representatives to ensure that they would deal at arm's length.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.571" offset="3805706">Now, a loan of a large sum of money can be just as corrosive of that absolute separateness sought by Congress as an outright gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.395" offset="3848965">Indeed, it would be our submission that the obligation of the representative would not be merely that of one who has behold him for have favored about him as in the case of a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.676" offset="3906121">But if the loan is for a large sum of money and is on demand or becomes overdue, it places the borrower at the absolute mercy of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.939" offset="3963173">Boswell in the light of Johnson had this to say and I think it fits this situation rather perfectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.181" offset="3988146">The way to make sure of power and influence is by lending money confidentially to your neighbors at a small interest or perhaps no interest at all and having their bonds in your possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.275" offset="4048436">The specific language of 302 was intended to and did cover any delivery or receipt of money that might cause such an abuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1045.301" offset="4284583">It possibly so but it seems to me the prohibition is clear there regardless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.648" offset="4321991">The structure of 302, I think also points towards the same construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.875" offset="4346859">Subsections (a) and (b) which we've been dealing with thus far are the broad prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.644" offset="4373922">The exceptions to these prohibitions are set forth in (c), and these exceptions are carefully defined, extremely detailed and very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.325" offset="4412688">I'm not going to take Your Honors' time now to go through them but when you look at those exceptions, you will see very clearly that the Congress knew what it was doing when it was drafting these exceptions and that it gave comparable consideration to the exceptions it wished to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.508" offset="4477367">And that it accepted only those things which would be free from abuse like a purchase and sale of a house, the checking off of union dues with written authority and that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.795" offset="4530552">And this is persuasive evidence, we submit, to paraphrase this Court's opinion in the Bernanke case, the wiretapping case that had Congress intended to allow employers to pay or deliver money on loan, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.496" offset="4605367">But not only the literal meaning and underlying purpose of the statute but the legislative history, supports the Government's view that all payments or deliveries of money, whether on loan or otherwise, were intended to be within the prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.528" offset="4661478">Almost exactly this same language of Section 302 first appeared at the second session of the 79th Congress in 1946 when Senator Byrd proposed an amendment to what was then known as the case bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.577" offset="4729710">It covered almost identically what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.774" offset="4750503">Speaking of the purpose of the amendment, Senator Byrd said, "It prohibits the employer to pay for any representative of any of these employees to collect or attempt to collect any money or other thing of value for the use of such representative or in trust or otherwise."</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.395" offset="4832946">Some senators were concerned over the broadness of the proscriptions particularly Senator Pepper was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.332" offset="4860740">And he argued that language forbids every type of delivery by employer to employees and every type of receipt by employees from employer except to payment of compensation for services rendered and the so-called checkoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.189" offset="4932106">Senator Taft who was also a strong supporter of the Amendment had this to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.451" offset="4953213">"With regard to the very wording, I assert that once we permit an agent to obtain money for his own use or for any purpose, it is affirmatively a dubious practice, an immoral practice and unless it is used for purposes which are properly defined by law, it should not be permitted."</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.911" offset="5023013">Now, this Amendment was adopted by the full Congress, the House of Representatives passed it and then the President vetoed the case bill and it failed to pass over his veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.982" offset="5083303">They went back the next year and went to work on this again and similar language was introduced in the Senate Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.217" offset="5124263">A majority of the Committee reported out against it but Senator Taft and Senator Ball and Senator Smith of New Jersey filed a minority report, brought the matter up, the specific language on the floor of the Senate in 1947 and over many protestations, the Section 302 was passed into law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1300.813" offset="5306598">But nowhere in the course of the history of Section 302 is that it would be from any indication by explicit statement or implied suggestion that the Congress did not intend to forbid every sort of financial transaction except those authorized between the employers and representatives of employees.</text>
