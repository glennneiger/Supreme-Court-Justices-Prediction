            <text syncTime="12.860" offset="154833">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.853" offset="186807">This action involves the contract generally -- which it generally been called the Dixon-Yates contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.974" offset="231320">It goes back to the year 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.443" offset="253158">The question is whether or not there was a conflict of interest involved which would be a ground for disaffirming or declaring the contract unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.019" offset="311463">In 1953, a question came up in this administration about whether the proposal of the TVA to build a new plant at Fulton, Tennessee steam plant, involving a large investment of government money should be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.597" offset="405713">It was included in the budget of President Truman.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.769" offset="426402">And the problem that the Budget Director, Mr. Dodge had was a question of a debt of Lehman and whether or not this -- this proposal should be approved or some new or different should be made with regard to the handling of the power needs in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.724" offset="518248">The Atomic Energy Commission needed additional power for its plant at Paducah.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.148" offset="543953">We've no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.598" offset="553775">And it had been serviced by the TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.541" offset="569553">The demands of the Memphis area were such that they run the neighborhood of 400,000 kilowatts and therefore, some additional provision had to be made in order to take care of the additional requirements of the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.166" offset="664012">In considering this problem, Mr. Dodge talked to Mr. Woods, the Chairman of the Board of First Boston Corporation who was the employer of Mr. Wenzell who will be described in this controversy and was the person who was -- the Government claims is involved in the conflict of interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.568" offset="773622">Mr. Wenzell was a vice president, a director and his wife owned 200 shares of the stock of First Boston Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.069" offset="823672">Mr. Woods, in May of 1953, suggested that the Budget Director hire Mr. Wenzell to make a study of the TVA in its cost and see what could be recommended to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.219" offset="884276">This study was made and the only bearing that it has on the matter before the Court is that Mr. Wenzell obtained information and knowledge about TVA and its cost and so forth that its fair inference could have been used and probably was in connection with the subsequent contract with Dixon-Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.891" offset="986885">That he made the study and that he exhibited to Mr. Woods, Chairman of the Board in his corporation without the permission of the juror of Bureau of the Budget and they discovered it later.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.144" offset="1055953">Then, when the Government thought that provision should be made to try to obtain a contract for the furnishing of electricity by the private utility, Mr. Hughes suggested and called upon Mr. Wenzell to come and advise the Government in regard to that, particularly with regard to the cost of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.079" offset="1175698">And in January of 1954, Mr. Wenzell's action runs from January of 1954 through April 10th as employee of the Bureau of the Budget in regard to the Dixon-Yates contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.557" offset="1301608">It was not -- it was known to AEC, to the Atomic Energy Commission too.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.471" offset="1333269">They did not know of his employment by Budget, that is the Atomic Energy Commission, that was the contract in agency, until considerably later period after April 10th that the Atomic Energy Commission did not, but the Bureau of the Budget did both Mr. Dodge and Mr. Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.294" offset="1424593">It's the position of the Government that they could not waive the statute and whatever they knew in regard to his action, they had no power to set aside the will of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.449" offset="1481122">Now, I'll try to develop what all they knew and what happened with regard to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.115" offset="1511842">It's suggested that the question of the cost of money was not an important consideration in this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.932" offset="1547055">The Government thinks it was primary and that the record shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.938" offset="1571088">Mr. Wenzell was a skilled person in this field and was selected by Budget for his knowledge in regard to the cost of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.675" offset="1606092">That was the entire purpose in first employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.330" offset="1628662">He was later used in connection with the costs under the contract to a considerable extent, and in addition to that, as an expediter to try to get a contract informed what the Government could make.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.198" offset="1752168">And I am trying to -- I will confine myself to the findings of the Court of Claims which are not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.947" offset="1795114">The contract involved as this largest factor, the cost of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.725" offset="1826252">It was to involve a cost for the plant of $120,000,000 about a $107,000,000 for the plan itself and the rest were additional working funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.763" offset="1882467">The cost of money alone, the service charges run around $6,000,000 a year out of something like $9,000,000 that would have to be paid for the energy in order to have this plan and get the benefits of it for the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.884" offset="1958954">So, it is apparent on the face of it that the cost of money was of great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.517" offset="1989465">But beyond that, an examination shows that in considering the cost of money, various formulas were examined by Wenzell and he then resorted to First Boston to get their help and advice for him in regard to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.393" offset="2072952">Now, he then advised Hughes about the cost of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.069" offset="2091656">And then, Mr. Dixon, the head of the sponsors, one of the heads with Mr. Yates, also asked early that Mr. Wenzell, as a personal favor to him asked First Boston in regard to what this -- these funds would cost, what they could be obtain for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.918" offset="2315055">He took Mr. Miller who had familiarity with First Boston in their sales department to a meeting of the Budget where they were going to discuss the cost of money and the possibility of this project without consulting Budget people at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.138" offset="2555904">The sponsors were to contribute -- I think that's the name of the trade, at least I -- were to contribute $5,500,000 out of the total capitalization involving the debt of $120,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.016" offset="2623404">And so in the trade, it's called "thin" because the equity capital is a very small part of the total contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.258" offset="2656423">Now, I don't mean that that's bad in itself but that makes the -- the cost of money a considerable problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.200" offset="2688188">So they examined the possibility -- the various possibilities, the cost of money based upon whether there was a 95 percent which this approximately what the amount of other capital and only 5 percent of equity capital contributed by the sponsors or 75 percent and 25 percent contributed by the sponsors or 50 percent contributed by the sponsors and 50 percent by borrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.856" offset="2802813">Well, you can readily see that the security for the lenders other than the equity contributors increases as the contribution of the equity is made through the transaction and therefore, it affects the interest rate and the amount that has to paid in order to pass such a plan by the capital for it and make it possible to have the electric energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.768" offset="2902392">Now, they found that it would cost 3.5 percent, the estimate was at 95 percent and 3.5 percent at 75 percent but 3.25 percent at 50 percent contribution of equity and they examined that carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.397" offset="2980968">Then Hughes said, "Well, that runs into considerable money, is there anyway by making it a longer term loan, which also has an effect on the cost of money and make it a 40-year?</text>
            <text syncTime="731.792" offset="3030497">Let's try that out."</text>
            <text syncTime="733.597" offset="3037811">And so, they took these various formulas of trying to determine what the cost of money would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.101" offset="3067800">And they examined that.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.678" offset="3078040">Wenzell didn't examine the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.033" offset="3083473">He took it back to First Boston.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.063" offset="8483610">A detailed letter substantially showing the thread of Wenzell's advice all the way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.433" offset="8521122">And the record is that Mr. James, the attorney for Mr. Dixon, used Mr. Wenzell's first draft 67 -- finding 67 that was not ever signed as the model for the one that was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.637" offset="8597922">And it shows how closely it was related all the way through and that advice relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.304" offset="8624567">Now, to show the reliance that they did place upon this kind of advice, Mr. Yates, the other sponsor in this matter wrote a letter the first part of March of 1954 to his directors saying that they had received advice from First Boston with Wenzell that this financing could be done at 3.5 percent in accordance with the $120,000,000 and so forth that they we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.352" offset="8748805">So he was reassuring his directors that this moneys -- advice in regard to the cost of money could be relied upon, was relied upon and that First Boston had given it to them so they could and they could assume that under the market was a fair assumption that they would be able to market these bonds and wouldn't have trouble with the financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.223" offset="8860296">And that's a part of the record with regard to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.803" offset="8878582">Now, on page 122 of that same volume, there is indented in the upper half of the page, the wording of the proposal and the identical language is used in the April 10th proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.251" offset="8992371">We have received assurances from responsible financial specialist, expressing the belief that financial arrangements can be consummated on the basis which we have used in making this proposal and under existing market conditions and then they go on to say and our offer is conditioned upon such consummation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.865" offset="9082859">Now, we call your attention to the fact that that was in both proposals, to show the reliance that was placed upon it and the fact that it was so important to this deal that the whole thing was conditioned upon whether or not that would work out in accordance with the advice that Mr. Wenzell had given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.199" offset="9180139">Now later on, as I presume you all know that the contract was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.662" offset="9201977">It was terminated in the first -- not for the conflict, it was terminated because Memphis came forward and said they would build a plant and that would take care of the -- the entire problem that wouldn't need the capacity of this proposal in order to satisfy the additional requirements of the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.766" offset="9298422">And then the -- after the April 10th proposal was made, it was -- a study was made for sometime and then a man by the name of Von Tresckow came forth with another proposal, unsolicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.707" offset="9362160">And that was then examined in the Government as to how it compared with the proposal of the sponsors and it accounted for some considerable delay in trying to analyze that by all of various interested parties that the Government got together to try to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.345" offset="9424750">And I -- and then July 7th, they started the negotiations on the contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.432" offset="9461112">And the -- the Court of Claims held as a specific plan that the contract substantially conformed to the April 10th proposal, so that in substance, it was the same as the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.252" offset="9524328">Now, there were changes in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.403" offset="9536972">There are modifications and changes but in substance, the Court of Claims found that it conformed to the April 10th proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.872" offset="9570826">The Government is not contending that it was overreached of any fraud in connection with the contract at -- after the termination because Memphis came forward offering to build the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.260" offset="9636446">The Government sat down to try to find out the termination cost, what it would pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.435" offset="9661106">And in those discussions, it reserved the right of whether or not the conflict of interest would be taken advantage of -- by the Government as grounds for disaffirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.137" offset="9711888">But they did proceed to discuss what the termination cost would be under the terms of the contract itself if they didn't disaffirm, reserving that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.951" offset="9747205">In the mean time, it was studied in the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.157" offset="9755982">There were many hearings before the Senate Committee and there is a -- a hearing before the SEC in regard to the sum of the financing earlier that referred to in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.477" offset="9797256">And then on advice of counsel, the Atomic Energy Commission did disaffirm the contract and say that because of the conflict of interest of Mr. Wenzell, working for First Boston and the Budget at the same time, the contract was disaffirmed and unenforceable against the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.531" offset="10461497">And the testimony of Mr. Dixon was that he thought he had directed First Boston to proceed with the financing as of April 12, but there is apparently a misunderstanding and Mr. Miller was out-of-town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.101" offset="10523773">They try to call April 22nd and someone else they try to reach so that Mr. Dixon was quite unhappy because they didn't have something ready for him in May -- early May and they got down to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.410" offset="10581034">Now, the fact is later that they brought Lehman Brothers in for half of the financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.898" offset="10618964">And that proposal was made by Dixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.351" offset="10628786">It's unexplained as to why, whether it's to try to get rid of the conflict problem or what.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.914" offset="10655013">There's no showing in the record that Lehman Brothers had ever done any prior financing for Dixon or Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.960" offset="10691166">But they are brought in to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.827" offset="10698689">And at that conversation between Mr. Dixon and -- and Mr. Woods, Chairman of the Board of First Boston, in regard to bring Lehman Brothers in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.871" offset="10738813">Mr. Woods is very unhappy about it according to the record and talk to as though he was willing to back out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.702" offset="10770160">And then he finally said that if they could have 60 percent of any fee and control of the handling of the financing, they would go ahead with Lehman Brothers in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.279" offset="10820524">And later, long time later in -- in 1955, after all the controversy in regard to the hearings and -- and charges in the Senate and so forth, the First Boston made a public statement that they were not charging a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.415" offset="10889070">And the record is that Lehman Brothers were unhappy with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.855" offset="10906833">They thought that -- that there should be at least a nominal fee and then it was done as a public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.683" offset="10938075">The Government doesn't think if there's a question of fee or not fee is important to the matter in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.204" offset="10964198">When First Boston did the OVEC job, they got $150,000 and $20,000 for expenses, a comparable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.511" offset="11013413">And it was throughout the period that Wenzell was working for both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.399" offset="11032952">He had every reason to think that they would get a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.352" offset="11044760">Now, his compensation was based upon a salary with First Boston and a bonus on the business that he was able to bring to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.903" offset="11083003">So the Government's position is -- is the effect on Wenzell's acting in good faith and completely on behalf of the United States to this involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.257" offset="11128351">And he had every reason to think he could get this business in there at that time that he would get something comparable to the OVEC fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.908" offset="11167013">Now in addition to that, the record is very clear that both Lehman Brothers and First Boston thought this was a very valuable financing to have as far as reputation in the business was concern and that they didn't even charge a fee in it that it would help them get other business that would be very attractive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.780" offset="11690506">Now, he also is acting clearly here, was acting for Dixon-Yates but the benefit he was expecting to get, according to the contention of the Government, was from the contract, the subcontract or the financing contract of First Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.841" offset="11778696">We don't claim that he had any direct financial interest in the Mississippi Generating contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.250" offset="11816417">We say that as a subcontractor, he was expecting it all -- all the time and had a -- a reasonable substantial expectancy, which is the general words of the Court of Claims, that First Boston was going to get this business when he was working for both of them and at the same time that he was -- he was helping the Government, he was helping Dixon-Yates so First Boston will get the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.366" offset="11940864">Now, it provides a fine or imprisonment or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.442" offset="11957164">And the -- an argument is made that it doesn't say that the contract is unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.508" offset="11985377">The position of the Government is that this is a declaration of the public policy by the Congress that you just can't -- can't be in that kind of a position where you're working for both sides when you're working for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.794" offset="12046503">And therefore, that being a declaration of public policy, the courts will not give judicial sanction to such a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.104" offset="12083806">Now, there is one question raised about the fact that the statute 18-216, a bribery statute, has a provision that the contract maybe declared unenforceable by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.404" offset="12140962">And they say that in the -- the legislative history is against our construction of this -- making this contract unenforceable under this statute because it doesn't have that like provision when the statute were considered much the same time back in 1862.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.546" offset="12209507">Now, the fact of the matter in that regard is that when Senator Fessenden discussed that addition and the issue then before the Congress was whether or not it should be unenforceable or void.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.677" offset="12266036">He said, "All I am doing is trying to have -- incorporating the statute of principal of general law," so it's the position the Government -- it really didn't add anything or subtract anything and that's what the legislative history is.Fessenden then said, "This is just the principle of general law that I am asking to be incorporated in this statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.583" offset="12365720">And there are a number of cases of the Court of Claims and this Court that -- to the effect that you will not enforce that type of contract of -- under this type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.873" offset="12426846">Now, there is one case that was discussed by the Court of Claims in the majority and the minority opinion that I'd like to discuss very briefly and that's the Muschany case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.124" offset="12479822">In that case, as you will recall, there was a contract for options.Certain options for land were secured and there was provision for a commission to the option agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.970" offset="12539277">And the majority of the Court, the -- the issue was whether or not this was a commissioned contract or a commission based upon cause or a contract or a cost-plus-fixed-fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.146" offset="12643976">The majority of the Court held that the contract was in fact a cost-plus-fixed-fee, which was express -- expressly exempted from the other provisions of the statute that prohibited any contract for cost plus the commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.647" offset="13401945">I only call your attention to that to emphasize what we think the importance of the rule that Congress has laid down here, the principle, in that if the Government is to be protected in this area and the courts would lay down a rule that you had to examine in every case whether or not there was a waiver by some official in the Government or whether or not there was some inequity in the transaction, it would be an -- an endless problem and would -- and would be no protection for the country whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="4347.706" offset="17494183">That's record to 103 and 104 to a meeting between Dixon and Nichols, then General Manager of the AEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.019" offset="17527411">And I'd like to read this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.813" offset="17542666">During that meeting, Dixon said that the best informed judgment which the sponsors had been able to indicate -- to obtain indicated that the interest charges on the debt money would be 3.5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.679" offset="17590105">But he further stated that if it developed, that responses had to pay a higher rate, he would expect the Government to reimburse the sponsors for the additional interest costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.478" offset="17629288">On the other hand, Nichols took the position that if the actual cost of money to the sponsors was less than 3.5 percent, he would expect to reopen the question of costs so that the Government would obtain the benefit of the lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.868" offset="17678817">The cost of money to which both Nixon and Nichols referred is not a static figure but varies from day to day and sometimes from hour to hour in accordance with the ups and downs of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.073" offset="17731688">As well -- here -- here and after appear, the actual cost of the money borrowed was 3.58 percent for MVG's bonds and 3.25 percent for its notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.182" offset="17780067">In fact, as the Court of Claim said, this agreement -- this information as to the cost of money was such tangible information that “A few well-placed telephone calls by any responsible person would probably have to obtained such information.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.503" offset="17845373">Now, that's what the case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.647" offset="17853942">And that's what Mr. Wenzell who came here to do a patriotic duty he's accused of doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.824" offset="17882676">Now, just to show how far wrong he was, I take my third and last chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.585" offset="17905664">We have here, at the first line, the Wenzell-First Boston interest estimate, 3.50, the actual interest cost, 3.58.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.549" offset="17949550">On the MVG commitment, the 25-year bonds of $104,448,000, the excess of actual interest over estimate on the life of the bonds is over $2,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.593" offset="18001795">Now, we had the right under the contract to go back and reopen it with the Atomic Energy Commission because of that excess of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.040" offset="18031574">We who are supposed to have been so greedy could have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.849" offset="18046725">The findings are that Dixon said when he first came down here that we were willing to do this business without regard to profit that we were willing to take any rate of return that the Federal Power Commission gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.769" offset="18106493">The further fact is we agreed that our losses would be limitless on this contract when we agreed to a CI of $600,000 a year on our profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.436" offset="18141080">And we agreed that in many years, it went over $600,000, we put it in the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.695" offset="18158111">So it went on to $600,000 on another year, they could use to make it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.622" offset="18173889">At the end of the 25-year power contract, who got the excess?</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.445" offset="18189145">Not we, the Atomic Energy Commission, the United States Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="4619.377" offset="18580877">Now, when we're all through this extensive record and the Government left no stone unturned in the trial of this case, we come up with two things which Wenzell did are two only.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.207" offset="18624240">Both upon the instructions of Mr. Hughes of the Budget Bureau, one he acted as an expediter because the Government had to have this power and had to have it by 1957 and that was of the essence to the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.238" offset="18680351">The other thing about which heard -- we've heard so much, he got from his banking firm, First Boston estimates as to the probable interest rates which would have to be paid on the money bar to finance the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.972" offset="18731238">Now, on the assumed probable interest rate that Wenzell was conveying to both petitioner and respondent, and he respond for the direction of the Bureau of the Budget, the finding is, and I read it, record 76, finding 55, "The object was to obtain the best possible and to get a figure which would not only be used by Dixon but would be known to the Bureau, so that both would be talking about one in the same factor," end of the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.229" offset="18892257">Now, Wenzell's activities were confined to this single question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.398" offset="18916916">Where -- what the Government wanted to know was that Dixon-Yates were talking about the same realistic interest rate that the Government was talking about, as to whether there could be some figure that would form the basis of the start of negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.407" offset="19013047">Now, curiously enough, if Mr. Wenzell was a fifth columnist planted by us on the Government, he concurred that the February 25th proposal, the sponsors was too high and that it should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.766" offset="19078457">That was a strange behavior indeed, if he was in anyway a fifth columnist and -- in answer to the question that you put me, Mr. Justice Stewart, as to whether the findings are unchallenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.504" offset="19149406">I want to make just one point to show you the difference between the state of their own challenge and the actuality, and I'll ask you to turn to page 35 of the Government's reply brief which the Solicitor General used extensively in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.393" offset="19212936">35, the last sentence at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.964" offset="19271241">Now, at this point, the Solicitor General made time after time after time in the cause of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.112" offset="19291826">The sentence reads, from page 35 of the Government's reply, "But the Government was unaware of the retention of First Boston and thus, the fruition of the conflict of interest during the entire period of contract negotiations from July 7th until November 11th and did not learn of the retention until February 18th, 1955."</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.131" offset="19407914">Now, it's interesting to note, first, that the Government recognizes that the period of negotiation did not begin until July 7th but what the Government refuses to recognize is the expressed finding by the court below, unanimous finding that on the very first day of negotiations, the sponsors' negotiators disclosed the Atomic Energy Commission that First Boston had been retained as financial agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.364" offset="19512822">Now, let me ask you the term of finding 126, appearing at page 117 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.560" offset="19565589">That finding reads as follows, "On July 7th, 1954, during the negotiation of the contract, the AEC representatives were informed that First Boston and Lehman Brothers were acting as financial agents to the sponsors."</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.901" offset="19650957">Now, could there be a greater and more diametrical variance between the main theme of the Government's argument in this Court and the unchallenged finding which I have just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.558" offset="19697560">Now, the lawyers who tried this case for the Government were able lawyers if I know for well that this conflict of interest defense depended upon a conclusion that Wenzell have the kind of a present pecuniary interest which is prohibited by Section 434, face had been at voluminous proposed finding flaw, counter findings to us asking for a finding that Wenzell had a present pecuniary interest during the time he was a consultant to the Bureau of the Budget.</text>

            <text syncTime="5316.475" offset="21369292">The policy of having a contract such as this was common to both the Truman and the Eisenhower Administrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.938" offset="21399176">The Congress concurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.706" offset="21410147">It was a policy which the court below finds that Wenzell had absolutely nothing to do with determining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.556" offset="21433553">President Truman determined it, President Eisenhower determined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.290" offset="21448495">Now, that policy was that TVA should not have $100,000,000 of federal funds for the construction of its proposed power plants at Fulton, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.146" offset="21503979">On spring of 1953, and again in 1954, efforts made at the Budget for the TVA Fulton plant but they were defeated in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.220" offset="21548283">And again in 1955, the Bureau of the Budget eliminated the TVA request for that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.261" offset="21580466">Now, another fact in regarding the contract is that there has never been in the history of contract laws respectfully submit a contract negotiated under declare of such merciless publicity as this one was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.496" offset="21641383">It was scrutinized, saved and analyzed from every angle where the negotiating team for the Government had the advantage of drawing on men of so many different sympathies ranging from complete sympathy with the President's policy to complete hostility with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.177" offset="21708048">Now, in addition to the -- likely negotiations by the AEC are referred to the decisions of the President who after all this Wenzell episode came out called, and the record shows this Dixon to the White House and he said, "I'm glad to meet an American who can take it on the chin as well as I think I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.523" offset="21789445">And then he was asked thereafter after this Wenzell business came out, did he think that Wenzell had done nothing wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.421" offset="21813060">He said, "Indeed, I don't."</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.384" offset="21820897">I think it was a fair contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.089" offset="21831764">So in addition to the recommendations of the President of the United States, we have the opinions of the Attorney General and below we have to meet an attempt to repudiated in one of the defenses or written opinion of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.775" offset="21882441">We have the Department of Justice, the Federal Power Commission, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Comptroller General's Office, the SEC, the AEC, the Joint Committee of the Congress and last but by no means least, the Congress itself because in order to make absolutely certain that this contract was valid, the Congress amended the Atomic Energy Act and added Section 164 primarily for the expressed purpose of authorizing the contract here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.606" offset="21997798">Now, we seek not a penny of problem in this action for breach of contract, although the Federal Government has saved $100,000,000 by our action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.461" offset="22037191">We seek to recover only for our out-of-pocket costs and we've been minimizing more along the line as we've been able to sell off equipment which we have bought but had no longer any useful.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Chanler</label>
            <text syncTime="5885.732" offset="23646333">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.959" offset="23659186">May I address myself to the unmerited question of enforceability under the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.227" offset="23688234">As the Solicitor General has pointed out, this is clearly a penal statute that I'm represented into another penal statute -- statute against bribery will be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5909.922" offset="23743091">In the bribery statute, after some debate, Congress inserted a provision making contracts sustained by bribery voidable at the election of the President as drawn originally, they are absolutely void.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.270" offset="23804426">When they adopted 434, the conflict of interest provision, they put in no reference whatever to the enforceability of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.023" offset="23843506">Now, the Solicitor General has pointed out to Mr. Senator President would introduce the amendment and the bribery statute said that it was a common practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.501" offset="23873390">I think I refer to rely as in authority on Mr. Justice Brennan in his recent opinion in Kelly against Kasuga and the long line of cases that -- that is based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.382" offset="23924903">This Court has repeatedly held that the courts will not have a sanction of contract unenforceability to a penal statute when Congress had the opportunity of putting it there and didn't do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.864" offset="23978820">It's perfectly saying that this is that type of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.675" offset="23998046">Now, as this Court has also repeatedly held, when a defense of illegality of a contract is raised based on an alleged violation of a penal statute or the prohibitory statutes that contains no sanction of this kind, the contract will be upheld unless the alleged illegality is so inherent in the contract itself or in the course of action that the contract could not be enforced without making the court a party to illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.533" offset="24133465">Now, of course, a classic example of that is where the wrong doer, the person who violated the statute is himself suing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6015.979" offset="24167320">And in the Solicitor General's reply brief, he cites, I think, five cases in support of his proposition that the Court should set aside contracts -- the contract here because of the alleged violations of Wenzell.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.230" offset="24220296">Of course, I don't admit there wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.533" offset="24225520">I'm merely trying to point out that the under the statute, didn't -- that wouldn't necessarily make the contract unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.003" offset="24251434">The Solicitor General cites five cases in which persons who had made, who had purchased land in direct violation of a prohibitory statute, government land agents who bought government land, a public printer who was supposed to have made a contract with a corporation in which he had an interest has public printer in his private interest, an order of premises who leased it to himself as the -- of a WPA administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.175" offset="24364074">Those are the cases they relay on to saying that of course contracts involving a violation of 434 of similar statute are unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.488" offset="24397302">Of course, that's not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.639" offset="24409945">Dixon-Yates, these respondents, hadn't anything to do with Wenzell's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.611" offset="24433768">They didn't support him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6084.783" offset="24442546">He -- he was not their employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.352" offset="24452786">As a matter of fact, and I shall in a minute, they did everything possible and was successful in doing so in getting him out before he could have possibly been in the position of duality.</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.339" offset="24488730">But his activities are entirely remote from the contract between Dixon-Yates and the Government, which is the contract with which we are here dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.986" offset="24531362">Now, Your Honors have had before you, it's not cited in our brief here, I think you've had -- well, the Court have had six cases dealing with 434 and it's only two with which the contract was set aside were the ones in which I have just mentioned where the public printer and the owner of real estate tried to deal with themselves in a governmental and private capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.428" offset="24621119">In other words, they were landlord -- lessor and lessee, lessor in his private capacity and lessee for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.722" offset="24650271">Of course, that violates the statute but he was the violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="6139.993" offset="24663333">Now, in the other four cases, l won't discuss it here because I see there isn't time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.175" offset="24680051">Muschany, I think, is the most persuasive one, both from the dissenting side and the majority side, as I read that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6152.386" offset="24712965">I have discussed it at length in the brief here and you would find it I think at page 72.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.095" offset="24731773">I think it's quite plain that a -- even where there was a violation of 434, even where a contract was negotiated by a government agent with direct conflict of interest where private party enforcing the contract has no part in it, it wasn't their fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="6175.411" offset="24805021">The Government had appointed the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.140" offset="24811917">The contract was enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="6179.443" offset="24821112">Now, here, of course, Wenzell -- neither Wenzell nor First Boston have any interest in this lawsuit whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.900" offset="24854967">They won't gain a penny by the enforcement of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.004" offset="24867401">Enforcement of this contract isn't going to sanction what he did even if the Court should believe that there was some technical violation in his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6198.466" offset="24897285">We're not defending him, we're defending -- we're representing Dixon and Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.922" offset="24915048">And keeping them -- allowing it then to enforce this contract isn't -- don't anyway sanction anything Wenzell did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6210.552" offset="24945560">Now, the Solicitor General evidently recognized that in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.263" offset="24960397">Of course, he went off and said, "Well, the trouble here is that Dixon-Yates winked at this alleged conflict and they engaged merely in lip service," and I just want to briefly remind Your Honor just what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.079" offset="25019643">The Solicitor General indicated a little of it but not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.044" offset="25031555">Almost at the outset, Mr. James, Mr. Dixon's lawyer, went to Mr. Dixon in between and they went to Wenzell and they said "Here, if this goes on and a contract develops, you may be in a frantic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6242.137" offset="25071888">You better talk to Hughes," and he talked to Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6244.799" offset="25082546">And Hughes said, "Oh, well, they're exaggerating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.289" offset="25092577">But talk to Dodge and talk to your own people."</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.169" offset="25104071">They talked to his own people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.374" offset="25108877">They talked -- First Boston want to get out in a hurry because they didn't want any interference when they're getting this business later.</text>
            <text syncTime="6257.000" offset="25131342">Dodge said, "Oh, I don't think there's anything to worry about right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.255" offset="25148374">There's not much of a hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6262.682" offset="25154121">It's going to be a -- no negotiations for months but still, you might as well wind up what you are doing and then get out anyway, if there's any possibility of the First Boston will be in the picture later."</text>
            <text syncTime="6275.732" offset="25206262">Now, of course that's true at that time in March.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.856" offset="25214830">There was nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6279.062" offset="25219636">There was nothing but a discussion about a proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6281.813" offset="25230608">There wasn't going to be any negotiations for three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.667" offset="25241997">What did Wenzell do when Dodge gave him the instructions?</text>
            <text syncTime="6287.425" offset="25253073">Dodge was the Director before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6289.786" offset="25262477">He went to three more meetings of the Bureau discussing the earlier proposal, went back to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.188" offset="25292152">He was called to Washington on the 23rd of March by Hughes to turn everything over to Francis Adams of Federal Power Commission, who was coming in as the new Bureau adviser.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.851" offset="25330813">He did, he turned everything over to Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.902" offset="25338964">He went back to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.524" offset="25345442">He was still to come back to Washington on the 3rd of April.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.103" offset="25355786">Nobody knows why the record says he wasn't heard to speak to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.523" offset="25373445">He did at the meeting at which the proposers came forth, announced that they had new cost basis and would make a new offer on the cost basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.792" offset="25410539">Wenzell went back to New York on the 10th of April.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.678" offset="25430079">He made some anonymous telephone calls to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.105" offset="25439796">Nobody knows why.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.022" offset="25443453">He says that's what he keeps his time terminative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6337.473" offset="25453275">Probably, he called up to say he was through and say good-bye, entertained by telephone and so, he resigned by telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.591" offset="25477726">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="6344.372" offset="25480861">That's all he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.431" offset="25485145">In other words, what this winking and lip service is so much obvious, the Solicitor General agreed, consisted in Mr. Dixon's started the chain of events that got Wenzell out before there was any possibility of negotiations or anything of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="6363.033" offset="25555466">Now, so far as there'd being anything wrong about what they did, it was pointed out in our brief, the steps which were initiated to which going to -- going to Mr. -- to his administrative superior and following his instructions are precisely the steps that are laid down today in the Solicitor General's own departmental regulations and the regulations of the Atomic Energy Commission, the Budget -- Bureau of the Budget and a dozen of the government departments as to the proper procedure to be followed if a government employee believes that he maybe confronted with a possible conflict of interest situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.183" offset="25720142">The regulations say that he is to report to his administrative superior and then take no further actions except in accordance to the directions of the administrative superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="6413.822" offset="25758699">And that's exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.453" offset="25769148">Now, it was Dixon-Yates that initiated those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6419.902" offset="25782941">Now, I must say that for the Government now to come and say, "There was something wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.671" offset="25806033">Dixon-Yates going to the Government, going to -- oh, we not only went to Wenzell, by the way, when we found he hadn't resigned by the way, Mr. Dixon and Mr. James went themselves to Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6436.717" offset="25850232">And the finding there, finding 79, is James asked Hughes how it was -- Wenzell hadn't resigned yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6444.787" offset="25882520">I think it's 79 if I remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.111" offset="25891819">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6448.106" offset="25895790">So that it seems to me their position is absolutely unimpeachable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6455.294" offset="25924524">In his reply brief, the Solicitor General seems to rather abandon that fact and he says, "Oh, well, the point is that the agreement was that the contract is voidable by the Government."</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.244" offset="25972381">Well, I would like to say, but I agree to the -- if that's so, your repudiation comes much too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.510" offset="26005400">There was some question here about what the purpose of this contract, wasn't about the $90,000,000 -- $100,000,000 dollar savings.</text>

            <text syncTime="6555.464" offset="26325243">The Budget Director said, "The Federal Government would be relieved by this of the necessity of providing within a period of about 3 years approximately $100,000,000 out of tax revenues or from additions to the public debt."</text>
            <text syncTime="6568.304" offset="26376547">That's what they wanted this contract for.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.422" offset="26385011">They wanted to see if they could have private people do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6574.245" offset="26400371">Now, when this proposal -- read this proposal and the other were presenting, they knew that it could be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="6623.060" offset="26595662">And it wasn't until Memphis said, "We'll relieve you and your budget and everybody of the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="6629.793" offset="26622516">You don't need to have Dixon-Yates or anybody make this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.157" offset="26635995">We, Memphis, will do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="6635.209" offset="26644250">That's why they terminated the contract not because of Wenzell.</text>
            <text syncTime="6639.043" offset="26659506">Up to that point, they accepted the benefits of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6644.400" offset="26680926">They had balanced their budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.873" offset="26686882">They've taken $100,000,000 out of the budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="6648.269" offset="26696495">I have virtue heading this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.486" offset="26705272">And it's perfectly absurd to suggest they ever would have found it out and gone back for the $100,000,000 and put it back in the budget, if it hadn't been for Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.541" offset="26737560">They never would have said, "Oh, but there was somebody called Wenzell there".</text>
            <text syncTime="6661.522" offset="26749471">He made us -- we've got a fine contract that's very good for us in spite of it but nevertheless, because of this little alleged conflict of interest, we're going to get out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6670.404" offset="26784998">It's absurd to suggest that they never would have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6673.289" offset="26796492">And I think, Your Honors, that I think that in a situation of this kind, where the contract is fair and honest, was entered into, with full, free and honest discussion by people not attached with anyway by Wenzell or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6689.889" offset="26862947">When Wenzell's position himself was purported to the Government and his removal brought about by these private contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6697.938" offset="26895130">I suggest that under those circumstances, public policy, which would be only test here under 434, public policy requires that the Government's honest contract be enforced.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="6715.710" offset="26966183">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.630" offset="26981857">I didn't mean to characterize anybody in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.490" offset="26997321">I didn't think I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6726.132" offset="27007875">I do think that several things need recomment, one, in regard to the regulations of the Department of Justice and other departments that are referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.037" offset="27051551">Those regulations go much beyond the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.266" offset="27064404">In that if there is any kind of conflict problem that doesn't involve contracting at all, the employee or agent or officer is instructed to go to his superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="6753.530" offset="27117484">There's no effort, no indication of any kind that the Government in any part of it is not recognizing the validity of this statute and living up to it and believing into -- in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.373" offset="27168893">That -- those regulations go much beyond that as far as keeping the Government clean in all of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.454" offset="27197210">Now, in regard to knowing about this contract, counsel called attention to your -- to finding 126 and read you just one paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="6784.694" offset="27242141">If -- if you read the next paragraph, the last paragraph in finding 126 on page 156, you'd see that the finding is, in December, 1954, the AEC had a representative present at the SEC equity hearings where it was stated that First Boston had been retained as financial agent for MVG.</text>
            <text syncTime="6807.663" offset="27333987">However, there is no evidence that any representative of AEC had knowledge up to that time that Wenzell, while serving as a consultant to the Budget Bureau, had been meeting with and supplying information.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.328" offset="27392711">Now, this is the contracting agency to the sponsors regarding the project nor that any AEC representatives knew the extent to which the sponsors were aware of Wenzell's activities in that regard.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="6835.740" offset="27446314">That's the last paragraph of 126 finding on page 156 of the appendix to the Government's petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="6846.868" offset="27490826">Then the following paragraph, finding 127, makes it clear that they never gave any notice whatsoever to the Budget Bureau that First Boston had been retained as financial agent by the sponsors or that the terms and the conditions upon which the retainer was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.193" offset="27580165">Now, that's an undisputed finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6877.259" offset="27612453">Now, if you go to page 153 in regard to this discussion about the fee, I said it took him quite a long time to decide they wouldn't charge a fee and the record proofs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6891.825" offset="27670653">In the middle of page 153 in the finding, it says the decision not to charge a fee was based on Woods' conclusion that the financing which First Boston had been retained to handle had flowed directly from the conversation which Woods had had with Dodge in May 1953, when Woods had offered Wenzell's services and so forth and that First Boston should not charge a fee for assistance in obtaining funds over designed to obviate the necessity of federal expenditures -- expenditure for the expansion of TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="6925.037" offset="27803564">Until November 17th, neither Lehman Brothers nor any representative of the sponsors had noticed the First Boston's attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="6932.311" offset="27832613">Then it goes on to tell about a discussion back and forth as to whether it was proper not to charge a fee and Lehman said that there should be at least a small fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.133" offset="27871901">And then they go on to say -- they got down to the question of the SEC hearings on what they were going to testify to and then they came out and made it clear that there would be no fee charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6954.063" offset="27919653">Then on page 155 at -- at finding 123 (Inaudible) find the heart of it, Dixon was surprised by First Boston's decision not to accept the fee for its services of financial agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6970.880" offset="27986944">The decision was unusual and without presence in the history of First Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="6977.186" offset="28012126">Now, all I'm saying is that inherent in it, I was trying to demonstrate in the brief here and in our argument that there wasn't any question with what Wenzell was on both sides and that the advice that he gave that this financial advice was certainly important enough for Hughes with the financial man himself tells he needed help on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7002.814" offset="28114631">And he looked to -- he got Wenzell for the very perfect adviser.</text>
            <text syncTime="7007.387" offset="28132916">And Wenzell was advising both sides on that very important question in that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="7013.893" offset="28158934">And then I say that it was inherent, it continued throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="7018.468" offset="28177220">And since it's -- it's the taint in the contract that it goes right squarely against the statute to allow the enforceability.</text>
            <text syncTime="7029.508" offset="28221419">In order to protect the integrity of government contract, it should not be enforced.</text>
