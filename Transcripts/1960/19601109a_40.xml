            <text syncTime="13.402" offset="157027">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.555" offset="169566">When I left this building yesterday evening, after we have just begun this argument, I must confess that for a moment I felt a little disjointed, as if living somewhat of an island.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.677" offset="230066">I was moving back into the mainstream of a nation which was concerned, not with problems of this kind, but with a national election.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.524" offset="269458">And -- and then as I thought about it a little more, I thought, "Well, perhaps that isn't so."</text>
            <text syncTime="47.552" offset="293595">Perhaps, the two hallmarks of a free nation are the exercise of the ballot, freely and secretly, and a fair trial, and of indication of the rights of every man to equal justice before the law for which this Court sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.851" offset="386800">And so I returned today thinking that our mission here is perhaps more important than it was than I thought it was even yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.673" offset="434030">I indicated yesterday that it was my purpose to direct myself to the dominant issue of the scope of the inquiry which the federal judge sitting in habeas corpus is to make when he is faced with an application for the writ and the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.709" offset="530160">The constitutional issues are issues which have been at least inquired into to some extent in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.726" offset="558268">And that my colleague, Mr. Zeldes, will address himself to the somewhat separable issue of access to counsel as a constitutional right by itself, perhaps as separate from the coercive character of the incriminating statements submitted against petitioner in the state murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.468" offset="649279">I am not going to -- of necessity, as I describe the events in this case, I will be describing how the incriminating statements were elicited, but I do want to make it clear that it is not my purpose so much to be arguing that constitutional issues of coercion as to make it plain, how they arose and who considered those issues so that this Court can best be acquainted with what bears on the inquiry, which the habeas corpus court should be making and this I hope will in part be responsive to Justice Frankfurter's very proper inquiry yesterday as to just who said what, to what tribunal, when and what did the State Supreme Court and subsequently, Federal Judge Smith sitting in the District Court have before him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.841" offset="5562702">And five hours later, Rogers was taken to the Coroner's office, interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.854" offset="5590810">The Coroner says he warned him of his right, assured him of his right to have assistance of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.967" offset="7683218">The appellee then files a counter finding and the judge takes which portions of these two documents he thinks applicable and prepares a finding for appellate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.300" offset="7728567">In response to your previous inquiry directed to Professor Pollak that procedure for the correction of the finding in the Supreme Court of Errors is such that one of the standard means for correction is failure to make a finding on material evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.314" offset="7792619">This was not raised in the usual case in Connecticut because the finding with which we are concerned, that so-called findings of underlying facts, what the lower courts consider that to be, were made in the course of a ruling on evidence before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.247" offset="7880391">And I think, if Your Honor would refer to the footnote of page 25, you would see the basic structure of the Connecticut appellate system, which I don't feel that we have adequate time to explain the detail at this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.110" offset="9683780">There has been considerable discussion over the last four years since this case has been in the federal court over what testimony Judge Smith heard and what he did not hear and what he should have heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.335" offset="9732681">It is our position, if Your Honor please, that the tribunal on August 31st held a habeas corpus hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.414" offset="9809063">At that point, respondent filed a lengthy affidavit asking Judge Smith to reconsider his opinion that both of these confessions were coerced and I might interject for just a moment to say that this was the first such opinion rendered by Judge Smith in 17 years as a district judge in the district -- in the section of the State in which he hears virtually all habeas corpus petitions from the state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.715" offset="9906239">Yet, even when respondent filed his affidavit for rehearing, he never objected to the propriety of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.844" offset="9942706">And on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the fist time, respondent objected to this hearing and said Judge Smith should not have heard all of these testimony and the conclusion that both of these confessions were bad on the basis of what Judge Smith heard and saw himself in the federal plenary hearing cannot be considered by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.992" offset="10027342">And instead, the Court of Appeals went on to shackle Judge Smith to findings filed by the state trial court for appellate purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.135" offset="10147924">In a long line of cases starting with Brown against Allen which will I -- I will not repeat now, this Court had set out the due process limits on the use of challenged confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.982" offset="10187316">I urge this Court to consider the denial of counsel also in regard to what five justices of this Court in separate opinions seem to indicate, renders the confessions inadmissible on the basis of the denial of counsel in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.560" offset="10245622">I think that since charges were filed against petitioner, although they were charges on another crime, that he is entitled to his absolute right to counsel in a capital case, and that the resulting confession should be held a denial of due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.222" offset="10856260">I should like to address myself to the facts went before the state trial court, and the record that was before the Supreme Court of Errors as well as to some of the facts before the District Court in the first hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.198" offset="10924178">I'd like to say at the outset that Judge Smith, in the first decision, determined that the proceedings in the Connecticut trial court and in the Supreme Court were tainted with a lack of due -- with a lack of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.170" offset="11020100">He made that finding without ever having looked at the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.313" offset="11036609">He did not have before him the transcript testimony nor did he have the findings made by the trial court on these confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.313" offset="11080600">He didn't have the plaintiffs' counsel and he didn't have the confessions themselves, which are most illuminating, in my opinion, as to the condition of the accused when he gave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.699" offset="11134203">And when I learned that he hadn't looked at this record and that was at the conclusion of the hearing, I moot to present all of that before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.072" offset="11183626">He did not accept them as counsel plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.450" offset="11329181">He had been questioned by police on a number of cases as recently as three weeks prior to this confession.</text>
