            <text syncTime="367.198" offset="1572133">They said first, “This case must be distinguished from Rea versus United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="373.085" offset="1595747">Which Your Honors set forth in 350 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.382" offset="1612884">They said here, “They were not acting under color of Federal Judicial Authority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="384.741" offset="1642350">The federal narcotic agents and therefore, the supervisory power cannot intrude to restrain their testimony in a state trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.075" offset="1691669">And we say that that is an invitation to these federal agents not to go near to the United States Commissioner and not to seek the protection of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.511" offset="1741406">It tells them in our humble opinion as clear as words can be that if you go and you'll get a warrant we can question you, we can ask about the acts surrounding the arrest, we can question the warrant, and then we can suppress this evidence and if you want to insulate yourself against this then just stay away from the United States Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.976" offset="1855300">Don't go near him, because if you don't go near them then we can't touch you, we can't inquire at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.695" offset="1886124">Therefore, we say that's an erroneous reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.717" offset="1898245">The other reason is they say that the admission of these narcotics has not been sought in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.621" offset="1933876">Now, Your Honors have told us in -- in the Rea case, that it's the duty of the federal agent to obey the rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.237" offset="2576280">We're talking here -- we're trying to -- we're seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court predicated upon the supervisory power which as late as June 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.850" offset="2618807">Mr. Justice Frankfurter called a peculiarly comprehensive power and designed to discipline federal officers so that we asked, “Is it designed to discipline federal officers and when they -- when they come under the federal court or can they avoid it, can they actually avoid it by not going near the federal court and going into a state court instead?”</text>
            <text syncTime="651.576" offset="2709713">Now, the -- the Government doesn't discuss the two reasons that the Court of Appeals talked about not going into federal court, enacting under federal -- color of federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.494" offset="2761331">They say that we are bound by the state order on what appears to me to be a principle of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.397" offset="2805008">And yet, I would like to -- I would like to recall that in the -- in the Rea case, the Court said that the command of the federal rules is not affected by anything that takes place in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.288" offset="2872508">That's what Mr. Justice Douglas said and as late as the Elkins case, Mr. Justice Stewart said that when you're asking -- when you were trying to find out that there was an illegal search and seizure by state officers that that is an independent inquiry, it's a question of federal law and so that the District Court has to hold a hearing and it has to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.513" offset="2997373">It says, neither large by one state court may have countless nor diminished by what another may have colorably suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.981" offset="3019316">Now, if that's true about state officers whom -- over whom you have no control for all intents and purposes except when they come in to a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.521" offset="3065501">If that's true about them, how much more is it true about federal officers over whom this Court has traditionally exercises this discipline, this federal supervisory power?</text>
            <text syncTime="756.980" offset="3131329">And they say also that we haven't alleged sufficient to show misconduct predicated upon the Draper case and of course we stipulated this thing into evidence now.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.433" offset="3173125">So, I think that covers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.602" offset="3181798">It's -- it was a question of trying to boil down the 39-page document into a couple of paragraphs to get before the Court but it's immaterial because what we want is the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.289" offset="3236551">That's all that we ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.757" offset="3242402">We -- we believe that we are being conscientious when we say -- when we discovered to the state court what happened, we believe we are being conscientious when we honestly believe that we'll prevail this in -- in the District Court and that the District Court will throw it out but we can't be presumptuous enough to say that we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.157" offset="3315963">Now, in Rea, there's the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.594" offset="3329755">In the Rea case, the man who went into the District Court and I remind you at that time there was nothing pending in the District Court when he went back and he saw his injunction he knew that the man he was going before had already said, “This is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.205" offset="3392240">He violated the federal rules.You got to throw it out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="826.293" offset="3408541">Now, this is in the side, but I wonder if this Section 198 (a) of Title 21 really means and it's on page 2 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.682" offset="3486072">The first one, now, does that mean that they can violate Rule 5 (a)?</text>
            <text syncTime="855.702" offset="3526196">Is Rule 5 (a) an invitation to the federal agents which says, “No, no, please take this fellow before United States Commissioner if you feel like it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="866.214" offset="3568201">Or is it a mandate that issues from the Court, from this Court which actually formulated the rules so that perhaps, by virtue of Rule 5 (a) you can't very well say that this was meant to supplant it and nobody mentions the fact and we said it out in a separate paragraph in our statement of facts that this man wasn't taken before the United States Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.150" offset="3675930">Now, that won't appear in the record because they stopped us when we went to inquire about it here.So propriety dictates that I not talk about that off the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.405" offset="3720965">Now, we say this that the Rea case certainly doesn't control this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.828" offset="3758686">The Rea case -- if it's limited to the proposition for which it stands means just what it says we are going and you get a search warrant and the judge already rules that it's a violation and then they try to go that they can be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.971" offset="3811244">We do say this that we should prevail here under the rationale of the Rea case.Under this peculiarly comprehensive supervisory power, we should be entitled to a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.181" offset="3884074">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.129" offset="3907897">I would like to argue basically two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.431" offset="3925138">First, which I will come to second but we don't think that the Rea case should be extended to this kind of a situation but we don't think the Court has to reach that broad proposition because we think that the District Court was fully warranted on the basis of what is shown by this record in refusing to re-adjudicate as petitioner's counsel has conceded the question of the validity of the search and seizure that petitioner had previously sought a ruling from -- in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.827" offset="4058676">And the state court had argued, objected his contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.286" offset="4080515">This case on its face is almost the converse of the Rea case.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.064" offset="4099636">And the Rea case what happened was, the federal court initially had suppressed the evidence and then after the federal court had suppressed the evidence, the federal narcotics agent went over in to the state court and filed a state complaint and instituted a state criminal proceeding based on the same state of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.681" offset="4190124">Now, on this case, there's been no proceeding at all in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.194" offset="4212172">This man was arrested by the federal narcotics agent and it's been suggested here that there was something improper because they arrested him without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.599" offset="4253759">Well, the statute specifically authorizes federal narcotics agents to arrest without a warrant when they have probable cause to believe that the man arrested is committing a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.996" offset="6203329">We think that the basic rationale of Rea; the reason why in Rea this Court deemed it appropriate to invoke its supervisory jurisdiction over federal officials was because that case involved a misuse of the Court's own process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.571" offset="6273651">In that case, a warrant had been issued by United States Commissioner who is an officer of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.944" offset="6303117">I'd like to emphasize to the Court that three times during the course of the opinion in the Rea case, the Court emphasizes the fact of the abusive process that was involved and states at one point that he had the relief he's asked against the federal agent who obtained the property as a result of the abuse of process issued by a United States Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.103" offset="6395800">And then later on, federal courts seek to enforce federal law and federal law extends to the process issuing from those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.837" offset="6430699">And the Court also quoted a statement from Wise against Henkel which speaks of the exertion of the authority of the District Court in connection with the execution of the process of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2862.266" offset="11552475">Well, in the event that we get the relief we're seeking from the District Court or this Court on the ruling on the merits predicated upon the stipulation of the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.256" offset="11588420">We say this to you; the effect would be to destroy the state prosecution just exactly as it was in the Rea case where they couldn't proceed without the testimony of the federal agents.</text>
