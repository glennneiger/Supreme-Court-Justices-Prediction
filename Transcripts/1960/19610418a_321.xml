            <label>Mr. Benjamin C. Sigal</label>
            <text syncTime="15.324" offset="164655">Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.364" offset="184822">At the close of the session yesterday, I pointed out what I considered to be the issue in this case, namely, is it permissible under Section 8 (b) (4) (A) of the Act deliberately to induce employees of customers, suppliers and others who perform services for a primary employer to refrain from rendering services or benefit to the primary employer at his place of business during a labor dispute between the primary employer and his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.945" offset="319195">Now, we submit that that question has been answered in the affirmative by this Court in the International Rice Milling case.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.914" offset="359006">Now, in that case, the Court dealt with an offending -- with a picketing of an offending employer in a primary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.347" offset="396727">The union there sought to organize the employees of a Kaplan Mill and picketed the mill with signs saying, “This job is unfair to the union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="88.304" offset="456600">When two employees of a customer of the Kaplan Mill came in the course of their employment for their employer to the mill, the picket stopped them and told them to turn back.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.844" offset="518771">Now, the Board held that since these activities, this picketing, arose out of primary picketing of the Kaplan Mill and were a carryout in the immediate vicinity of the mill, they were lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.341" offset="580733">The Fifth Circuit Court reversed and then -- and this Court unanimously reversed the Fifth Circuit and upheld the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.045" offset="615528">Now, among other things, it pointed out that Section 7 and 13 of the Act and immaterial legislative history of the Act, supports the Court's statement that nothing in 8 (b) (4) is to be construed to interfere with, impede or diminish the union's traditional right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.276" offset="712495">And that Congress did not seek in that Section to interfere with the ordinary strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.816" offset="738617">And before analyzing this case further, I'd like to mention also the Denver Building and Construction case which was decided on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.801" offset="774562">Now, in that case, the primary employer was a subcontractor employing non-union laborer.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.712" offset="806222">The union called a strike against the neutral general contractor picketing with signs saying, “This job is unfair,” in order to force him to terminate his contract with the primary employer, namely the subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.664" offset="870066">The Court held that that was prohibited under Section 8 (b) (4) (A) and there -- and affirmed the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.964" offset="895248">He pointed out that the only way the union could have obtained its strike objective was to force the neutral employer, the -- to back -- to break his contract with the subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.080" offset="959718">And having achieved that -- that was -- would've been the end and was the end in that case of the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.780" offset="982497">Now, the Court contrasted Denver with Rice Milling in the Denver case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.180" offset="1008097">They declared in Rice Milling, the union was seeking recognition from the primary employer and that its action in seeking to influence the employees of a customer of -- then Kaplan Mill was no more than traditional and permissible in a primary strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.116" offset="1087822">It said further that the union was not striking against the customer and was not encouraging concerted action by the customer's employees to force the customer to boycott the mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.737" offset="1138291">Now, this statement in Denver illumines the statements of the Court in Rice Milling, that a union's inducements reaching individual employees of neutral employer only as they happen to approach the picketed place of business, generally are not aimed at concerted, as distinguished from individual conduct by such employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.982" offset="1247274">And the Court stated that there was no inducement of concerted action there of the kind proscribed by Section 8 (b) (4) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="296.809" offset="1290637">Now, in Denver, the Court also approved the approach of the Board in the several cases which it had presented to the Board in the course of its -- stating its rationality -- and rationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.900" offset="1339016">One of its -- the cases was the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.646" offset="1357928">Now, Ryan was almost identical with the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.178" offset="1376110">In that case, Ryan was a contractor engaged in constructing in addition to the Bucyrus Plant located on the 35-acre tract, enclosed by a wire fence.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.141" offset="1419891">Now, about 500 feet from the main gate and near the construction area, Bucyrus had installed a separate gate for the use of the Ryan employees and for the suppliers of Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.614" offset="1477778">In the course of a strike against the Bucyrus, the union picketed all entrances of Bucyrus including the gate -- the Ryan gate, publicizing a dispute with signs most of which did not identify Bucyrus.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.422" offset="1537024">Ryan's employee did not cross the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.682" offset="1550085">The Board held that this was primary picketing and it made no difference whether 1 or 100 employees refused to cross or wished to enter and refuse to cross the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.867" offset="1590836">And the picketing did not lose its primary character in support of a labor dispute with Bucyrus because the Ryan employees were the only ones who didn't cross or that rather the only ones who used that gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.602" offset="1653739">Now, the Court -- this Court cited that case and the action there as the -- as an ordinary strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.797" offset="1686549">Now --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="395.932" stopTime="406.226">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="395.932" offset="1687071">Do you think it makes any difference, in this connection Mr. Sigal, of what kind of a strike it is that is so long as it is a lawful strike, whether it's an economic strike or strike for recognition or -- or what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="benjamin_c_sigal" startTime="406.226" stopTime="425.027">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin C. Sigal</label>
            <text syncTime="406.226" offset="1728240">No, I think it's -- that makes no difference -- if it's a law -- so long as it's a lawful strike, certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.887" offset="1750915">And if you're now talking about the -- the question of picketing and so long as the picketing is -- and the conduct is in the traditional fashion, it makes no difference.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="425.027" stopTime="431.453">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="425.027" offset="1803473">The strike in this case, which led to the picketing, was over some grievances under a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="benjamin_c_sigal" startTime="431.453" stopTime="537.982">
            <label>Mr. Benjamin C. Sigal</label>
            <text syncTime="431.453" offset="1829177">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.998" offset="1831372">And there was no issue raised as to the legality of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.986" offset="1843284">That was conceded by all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.104" offset="1859793">Now, in the Denver case, the union sought to have the employees of a general contractor that is the neutral employer, stopped work for the purpose of causing him to terminate his contract with a neutral employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.053" offset="1927607">Now, it must be pointed out in that case -- that in that case, the employees of a general contractor were not performing work for the primary employer who was the subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.547" offset="1977553">Now, with the aid of the rationale provided by the Board, this -- this Court said that in the views of the Board as applied in the Denver case, this Court found conformity with the dual congressional objectives to protect -- to preserve the right to bring up labor organizations, to bring pressure against offending employers in a primary labor dispute and to shield unoffending employers and others from pressures in controversies not their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.451" offset="2133138">Now, a minority of this Court at that time believed that the decision unduly restricted the right to picket and strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.412" offset="2168978">And that 8 (b) (4) (A) should reach only the case where the industrial dispute spreads from the job to another front.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.418" offset="2213073">Now, before examining the extent to which the Board has departed from the views it supported in Rice Milling and Denver in which views were upheld by this Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="842.148" offset="3471966">The Board in its brief here makes certain important concessions which narrow the area of contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.392" offset="3512926">First, the Board concedes that Section 8 (b) (4) (A) is not to be read literally, since to do so would mean the banning of nearly all strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.823" offset="3550647">It concedes that the Congress did not intend in Section 8 (b) (4) to interfere with the ordinary or primary strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.896" offset="3586905">It concedes that the threshold question is whether the challenged activity is primary or secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.478" offset="3617311">And it concedes that the right to engage in picketing in the light activity in a dispute where the primary employer includes the right not only to appeal to the employees of the primary employer, but also to influence third persons to withhold their business or service from the struck employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.173" offset="3700067">Now, it concedes further that after the decision of the -- this Court in Rice Milling and Denver, it changed its opinions or its views with respect to the -- this matter and began to reevaluate and started on an entirely different course, which ends in part in the case we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.729" offset="3794317">It took the position that it could -- that the Denver decision left the three to jettison the original approach which was approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.413" offset="3837053">Term -- predicated on the terms of the Act in the legislative history and traditional strike activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.551" offset="3865579">And it now says that under this new approach, duration of the employment at the place of the primary employer is the criterion as to determine whether the action is secondary or primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.047" offset="3931512">Under the present view of the Board, it is no longer pertinent whether the situs of the dispute is on the premises of the primary employer and it is no longer pertinent whether the work is done by the neutral for the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.405" offset="4025031">Now, in their view, the primary consideration is whether the employer, that is the primary employer, uses the premises -- that is whether the neutral employer uses the premises along with the primary employer in a substantial and continuous manner as a regular workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.457" offset="4121161">If he does, then the picketing, if it is not confined to picketing of the employees of the primary employer, the -- maybe secondary -- maybe prohibited because then the union unnecessarily directs its picketing at the neutral employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.204" offset="4196185">Now, the reason for this as distinguished from principle is that the picketing is focused upon neutral employers who work steadily at the site of the dispute and thereby may injure, may injure the employer more seriously than where he is only a transient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.781" offset="4278523">Now, we say that this approach determining the matter on the basis of injury is entirely outside the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.705" offset="4314154">Is not authorized by act and in -- in effect constitutes administrative legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.670" offset="4350098">The question is -- should be directed to the question of the right to primary picketing of the -- the picketing of the primary employer and not to the question of injury, this -- or the degree injury of the secondary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.229" offset="4424286">Now, the Board feels or takes the position that it has a right simply to balance interests and to determine when the strike pressure is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.982" offset="4475277">We'd say there's nothing in the law that gives -- that says that adequacy of strike pressure is a criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.734" offset="4502340">Now, in -- in the guise of administration, it has placed limitations which Congress has not placed on striking and picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.305" offset="4536613">Now, it is our view that just as this Court held in the Insurance Agent's case that Congress did not allow the Board in the guise of determining good or bad faith in negotiations to regulate what economic weapons a party might summon to its aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.136" offset="4611950">And just as in Curtis, it held -- this Court held that the Board could not in the guise of administration condemn picketing for recognition by a minority union, because it disapproves of the economic pressures which were generated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.131" offset="4671927">So we say the Court must not be allowed to condemn primary picketing because it believes picketing is necessary or that the economic consequences on neutrals are too severe.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="1166.086" offset="4767744">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.220" offset="4792299">Section 8 (b) (4) (A) bars a union from inducing employees to strike where an object is to put pressure on their employer to cease doing business with another employer, with whom the union has its basic dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.425" offset="4881115">Now, there is little question that the union's picketing and allied activity at Gate 3-A which was reserved the exclusively for the use of the neutral contractors and their employees, meet the literal requirements or a violation of Section 8 (b) (4) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.161" offset="4980067">The gate was used only by the contractors and their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.989" offset="4999293">The picketing there induced the contractors' employees to stop work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.365" offset="5024789">And as petitioner admits and as the Board found, this was the reason for picketing or induce a concerted refusal by the contractors' employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.677" offset="5094066">Now, the company which is intervened in the case whom you will hear after I finished within the matter there that is since the picketing at Gate 3-A was or the object described in Section 8 (b) (4) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.692" offset="5178180">It was necessarily violative of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.095" offset="5219767">For the Board, it is a little more difficult for the reason that if you applied 8 (b) (4) (A) literally, you could leave no room for the right to engage in primary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.863" offset="5298866">And it's well settled that 8 (b) (4) (A) was not intended to obliterate that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.716" offset="5374203">Now, Congress however, did not define what they -- what it meant by primary activity, but as we read the legislative history and we think our view is supported by the Denver case, Congress issued any of the common law tests for defining that activity because it was something that different jurisdictions differed about, but instead, left the drawing of that line to the Board by the process of accommodating as this Court said in the Denver case, the dual congressional objectives of preserving on the one hand the right of labor organizations to bring pressure to bear on offending employee or employers in primary labor disputes and on the other hand, of shielding unoffending neutral employers in controversies not their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.611" offset="5705853">In short, we think that with respect to drawing the primary secondary line, this is an area, if I may paraphrase another decision of this Court in the Insurance Workers case, where Congress put the question to the Board to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.816" offset="5786624">It is analogous to the situation of balancing the conflicting interests with -- in Republic Aviation, the right of solicitation on company property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.918" offset="5839078">It's analogous to balancing the competing interest in the Buffalo Linen case as to where the right to strike collides with the right of the employers to protect their bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.196" offset="5888188">It is not like the situation in Curtis and Insurance Agents where Congress answered the question leaving the Board little to do but to apply the direction of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.092" offset="5979721">Now, I think it's important to view the problem in that setting because I think it makes a lot of difference as to the latitude that the Board has in this area and to the considerations that it can take into account based upon its experience in drawing the line here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.170" offset="6092048">Now, let's see how the Board has attempted to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.907" offset="6119006">And I think there's no trouble in the situation where the primary employer and the secondary employer are engaged in business at separate locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.003" offset="6203434">I think the union will agree that in the case where the primary employer is fully operating at one site which is the Rice Milling situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.327" offset="6272711">Picketing that is confined to that site can be regarded as primer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.578" offset="6301654">If I'll -- and if the secondary employer is operating at another site, you extend that picket line over to the secondary site and there seek to induce refusals to work, that is secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.105" offset="6359751">The trouble comes where you have enmeshed employment where the primary employer and the neutral employer are at work on the same job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.521" offset="6417429">Now, that is not the traditional situation that's encompassed by the concept secondary boycott or -- or primary strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.717" offset="6782203">On the other hand, if you don't let the union picket there, its right to picket the primary employer maybe largely destroyed because since he spends considerable time on those premises, that's the only place that you can reach him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.451" offset="6849181">Now, the Board, in drawing a line between primary and secondary is of the view that in these enmeshed employment situations, the union's action will be regarded as primary so long as it has made every effort to confine the activity to the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.675" offset="7010095">However, -- and if there should be any secondary work stoppage as a result of that, well that is incidental to the primary activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.915" offset="7067042">However, if the union has gone beyond that and made a -- a purposeful effort to direct its activity at the -- at the neutral, then the Board views that as -- as tipping the scales and bringing -- making the activity secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.507" offset="7141439">Now, that was the situation that this Court had before it in the Denver Building Trades case, which was a companion to Rice Milling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.923" offset="7183026">As Mr. Sigal indicated, that involved the typical building and construction situation where the primary dispute was with a subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.702" offset="7238196">The union picketed the job site that he worked on along with other subcontractors and the general contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.570" offset="7269648">And it did not confine its activity insofar as possible to picketing the primary employer, but use signs and other action which made it clear that it was inducing a concerted stoppage of work by the neutrals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.203" offset="7348224">And a violation was found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.978" offset="7363271">The Board carried that principle over to the situation exemplified by Moore Dry Dock, where you have -- say the primary employer has a ship and that comes into a neutral's dry dock for repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.042" offset="7443519">And let's say as in Schultz, he has a truck and that goes around making deliveries to neutral stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.059" offset="7479568">You can picket at that site so long as you do not make a deliberate effort to carry your message beyond the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.395" offset="7524916">Now, the thing that creates the problem is that when the Board was originally working out these views, it did not apply the enmeshed employment rule to the situation where the enmeshed employment occurred on the premises of the primary employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.207" offset="13588250">May -- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.784" offset="13610506">Petitioner is relying rather heavily here on a concession which appears in the Board's brief in which Mr. Come has adverted, namely that if you read Section 8 (b) (4) (A) literally, it would seem to ban all primary strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.299" offset="13708518">Now, I submit that even though that observation was taken from opinion of Judge and the later opinion by Judge Hand, that that's not a fair reading of the statute granted that the draftsmanship of the Section 8 (b) (4) may have practically it would be desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.977" offset="13815306">I still think that is a rather strained and almost a perverse interpretation of Section an 8 (b) (4) (A) to say that it would -- prepared primary strikes unless tested out in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.217" offset="13896286">If one should ask the employees surveying this construction companies why they were striking, they probably would have said they didn't want -- they wanted their employer to stop doing any work for General Electric during the strike or if should asked any of the General Electric employees why they were striking, I doubt very much that anyone of -- any of them would've said, “Well, we want General Electric to cease doing business with everybody.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.926" offset="14015091">They probably would have said, “We want to General Electric to remedy our grievances or give us better contracts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.375" offset="14032854">Something of that sort, so I think it's -- that to give the statute its literal meaning which is what the court below did, that is positive of the case because the court below said “It's the intent that counts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.274" offset="14116446">And here of course, the intent of the union is pinpointed by the fact that they selected this segregated gate for picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.217" offset="14168273">And -- and as further shown by the fact that if this conference -- while the picketing was going on and when the representative of this building trades unions attended the conference, the leader for petitioner's union pointed out that they had a picket line there and -- and he didn't want any of these construction workers to cross it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.881" offset="14270882">So there's no doubt as to the intent here and I think that's really dispositive of the case and would avoid getting into all these complications of situs and common situs and roving situs which Mr. Come has had to advert to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.701" offset="14358131">It's a -- it's rather strange if this section could be construed as prohibiting primary strikes that neither Senator Pepper or Senator Morse for the principal opponents of the Taft-Hartley -- of building the committee and who played a large part in the drafting of the minority report and spoke extensively against Section 8 (b) (4) on the floor, that never occurred to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.828" offset="14506715">They objected to Section 8 (b) (4) and that they call it -- went further than to prohibit what economic writers spoke of as a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.602" offset="14561782">And they would have limited a secondary boycott to situations where the employees were not working on the same premises or where there wasn't so much unity of action or whether the strike was for an illegal objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.452" offset="14649135">The petitioner's brief relies rather heavily upon some remarks of Senator Taft which were taken out of context in which he said that his bill was not intended to prevent people from striking over wages now as in other working conditions under -- engaged picketing on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.011" offset="14743385">And when Senator Taft made those remarks, he was not saying this because he felt that some people on the floor believed that Section 8 (b) (4) (A) was prohibiting a primary strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.555" offset="14817573">Quite the contrary, what he was doing was defending the bill on the ground which was perfectly obvious to anyone reading it that it didn't go so far as to prohibit striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.825" offset="14886640">They remembered that that legislation was written during the period of the great wave of post-war strikes which succeeded a period of government regulation of wages and prices in which there hadn't been a -- strikes had been illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.263" offset="14968456">And -- and there was this certain amount of public sentiment for going back to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.325" offset="15008684">So when Senator Taft made the remarks which quoted in petitioner's brief, he preceded them and I'm quoting from page 1107 of volume 2 of the legislative history, “We have considered the question whether the right to strike can be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.053" offset="15099591">I think it can be modified in cases which do not involve the basic question of wages, prices and working conditions, but if we impose compulsory arbitration or if we give the Government power to fix wages in which men must work for another year or for two years to come, I do not see how in the end we can escape a collective economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.244" offset="15188302">We give the Government power to fix wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.143" offset="15199901">I do not see how we can take from the Government the power to fix prices and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.594" offset="15253713">Now, one thing of course that gives petitioner's arguments a certain amount of support was that there was a period shortly after Taft-Hartley Act passed in which the Board, not looking at the full legislative history, not doing any research apparently upon the evolution of the Senate Committee Bill from S55 into the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.029" offset="15399476">These say some of the things that Mr. Sigal is saying here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.963" offset="15423195">But I submit Your Honors that the Ryan Construction Company case falls into that same class of cases like the lock-out cases, Communist disclaimer cases, the hot cargo cases and the professional employee cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.007" offset="15491427">Cases in which in the early period of the Act, the Board was not giving the statute its -- its plain meaning and a result, this Court had occasionally reverse the Board in all four of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.241" offset="15556315">And now the shift of the Board's position from the Ryan case to this General Electric case wasn't a judgment of Board expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.763" offset="15602395">Section 8 (b) (4) is identical to Section 303 which is a Section of course which could come up in the District Courts and reached this Court and review that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.081" offset="15643669">So what we really have here is not a question of expertise, it's a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.229" offset="15684315">Now, Mr. Sigal has conceded that if he's correct in his position, this could also apply to a secondary -- to a -- this type of picketing in a strike for recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.093" offset="15771773">Strike for recognition of -- prior to the Landrum-Griffin Act at least, were lawful as this Court found in the Curtis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.483" offset="15813256">Now, in the -- Senator Ball, one of the managers of the Taft-Hartley Bill in the Senate floor refers to -- and this is mentioned on page 29 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.106" offset="15887757">He refers to a situation in which a picket line was formed around the premises of a non-union employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.763" offset="15922448">And thereby sends -- his supplies were chopped-off, the men were forced to enter the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.498" offset="15949406">And he was referring to this as -- as in connection with his proposed amendments which resulted in the adoption of Section 8 (b) (4) (A) which this Court construed in Curtis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.560" offset="16009592">Apparently, the Court construed it correctly in Curtis because Senator Ball said that another section of this bill -- and of course he must have meant Section 8 (b) (4) (A), the very question here, deals with this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.693" offset="16078137">So that here, if we apply the obvious congressional intent, it's -- it would seem that any picketing directed at -- at shutting off suppliers and costumers -- as to the employers and costumers, which would be prohibited by Section 8 (b) (4) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.274" offset="16196420">I want to go so far as to say that in every primary strike if there's a picket line and some odd suppliers don't come in, that that is necessarily a violation of the Section 8 (b) (4) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.226" offset="16264234">I would say that's possibly a windfall that the primary strikers have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.988" offset="16299342">But -- but where the pickets were out of location, where it's perfectly clear that their impact is simply upon the employers or secondary employers, whether those employers are resident employers on the premises like this contractors or whether they're simple employers of trucking companies who, coming in to make regular deliveries and pickups, it seems to me perfectly clear that that's a violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.053" offset="16447613">Now, there's nothing inconsistent as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out between this position and what -- on the conclusion this Court reached in the Rice Milling case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.808" offset="16506650">Remember the -- at some point of the main petitioner's brief that there were two people involved in this, but one of them was just a passenger or a helper on the truck, so that you couldn't say the two men were leaving in concert because by the very physical location of the helper, he had to leave when the driver left.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.147" offset="16595989">Now, what that case was about was a -- it was concerned with a picket line on a railroad site in which they're certainly concerted activity, certainly an encouragement of concerted activity there.And this particular plant, the Kaplan Mill, was primarily supplied by rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.106" offset="16699747">The Board in its original decision had held that the picketing at the railroad site was not an unfair labor practice because a railroad was not an employer within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.781" offset="16754500">The Court of Appeals reversed the Board on that as well as the Board's situs doctrine on the truck driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.822" offset="16818657">But when it reached this Court, the Board did not apply for certiorari on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.965" offset="16839241">In effect, a confessing error, let the decision of the circuit stand so that all that was before this Court was this rather odd incident of -- isolated incident since the whole thrust of the picketing was at the railroad of the pickets suddenly move -- moving over it and attacking this single truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.034" offset="16943522">The point has been raised as to whether or not the new legislation has any bearing on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.541" offset="17001514">It -- it is a question which the Court I think, must consider to this degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.495" offset="17033383">Since this order or decree or the court below operates respectively, if the new legislation had harshly repealed Section 8 (b) (4) (A), then conceivably, the order should be modified.</text>

            <text syncTime="4293.474" offset="17277262">One of them is the Denver Building Construction Trades case which of course was a case involving the same premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.991" offset="17307355">The other is the Moore Dry Dock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.234" offset="17328358">Now the -- one of the limitations in Moore Dry Dock -- that was a case which the Board is also relying on as a common situs case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.616" offset="17385827">They recalled a primary strike, was a strike on a ship which was in the dry dock for repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.969" offset="17427205">The -- when the seamen union came around to picket in aid of their strike, the owners of the ship and the owners of the -- wouldn't let them come up to the place where the ship was Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.066" offset="17499617">So they had to picket outside the dry dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.150" offset="17516022">The effect of their picketing was to cause a number of the ship building employees and not to cross that picket line, employees of another employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.598" offset="17557713">The Board in that case said that it was not holding that to be an illegal inducement because the strike which was called on the ship was a lawful primary strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.884" offset="17630960">And these strikers or pickets were not permitted by management to approach the (Inaudible) and as to limit their picketing to the place where the actual dispute was occurring between the ship master and the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.477" offset="17717269">And -- but here, in contrast to them, this picket line could have been limited to the entrances frequented by the employees of the struck employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.389" offset="17780903">And if it's not -- so there, I would say that under the legislative history, it's crystal clear that Congress intended that's -- the situation here was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.829" offset="17878706">I also think that for this reason, the House conference report is -- is very (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.626" offset="17917889">But as -- it's prefaced by the remarks that Congress didn't intend once they put in this proviso about picketing, permitting primary strikes and primary picketing to change the existing law or rule to the decision, allowing that -- limiting it when they gave this case, illustrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.275" offset="18004511">Now, this particular case and another case in which -- an earlier case, this Crystal Palace case in which Ryan and Fishman (ph) overruled or limited, had received very wide publicity in the weekly labor relations report, at which the kind of a bible of the most lawyers and -- and congressional staff people who work in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.749" offset="18106389">So that is extremely unlikely that Professor Cox who was running the -- was negotiating of what was on the House conference report in the Senate with Mr. Ryan, the able and experienced House counsel, were unaware of -- of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4626.389" offset="18608880">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.817" offset="18626644">Now, I'd like to advert to several of the arguments that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.337" offset="18648691">Now, first when Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked, “Did the Board change the criteria?</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.930" offset="18691114">When did the Board change the criteria applicable to this case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.979" offset="18711280">Now as a matter of the fact, so far as -- as we read the brief of the Board, those criteria have been enunciated for the first time in the brief of the Board to this Court, it was only in the brief, in that brief that there was any enunciation of the principle which the Board now think -- think should be applied, namely, the duration test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.073" offset="18815666">That is never, prior to this case, been applied, certainly, never considered by any other court in any case prior to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.874" offset="18850879">In the Board's decision, the question was related simply to the exclusiveness of the use of this gate and the oral appeals at this gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.695" offset="18902183">Now, in -- in the argument to this Court, the Board is now -- has set aside the question of the exclusive gate, as the Board itself did in cases which came up after this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.426" offset="18953070">And it says merely that the link that if the service of the -- of the independent contractors was regular and permanent, then the picketing at -- the picketing of those employees -- of the independent contractors would be of a secondary nature, relating the entire matter to the duration of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.509" offset="19041364">Now, we say there's absolutely no warrant in any of the -- the legislative history nor anything that this Court has said to justify what in our view is simply administrative legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.873" offset="19098833">Now, the impossibility of the application of that rule to the -- is shown by this case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.630" offset="19129866">Here, we have a dozen contractors or six of them actually at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.870" offset="19146898">One of them had been on the premises for two years or two and a half years, one of them had been on the premises for one month, others have been for periods in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.662" offset="19185977">What constitutes permanent or regular?</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.500" offset="19197367">So far as the employees are concerned, of those employees, none of them, perhaps with one or two exceptions, had been there for more that a month or in most cases, for a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.683" offset="19242088">So this -- this principle or criteria has not been spelled out so as to be possible at all of applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="5178.605" offset="20817795">That at the end 8 (b) (4), the -- there is a provision protecting a union's right to publicize the fact that one or more employers are handling or selling products of another employer with whom there is a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.987" offset="20879339">That provides us -- though specifically provides, however, and with the right to publicize that fact exists only, “As long as such publicity does not have an effect of inducing any individual employed by any person other than the primary employer in the course of his employment to pick up, deliver or transport any good or not perform any services at the establishment of the employer engaged in such distribution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.694" offset="20986128">Now, we submit that if Congress had intended any such limitation to apply and this is the type of limitation that in fact, that the Board here wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.942" offset="21027192">It would certainly have said so in the very section which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.089" offset="21043702">Now, another -- a similar proviso appears in Section 8 (b) (7), which deals with organizational or a recognition picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.499" offset="21085393">And there says that picketing for the purpose of informing the public that is protected, unless any effect of such picketing is to induce any individual employed by any other person in the course of employ -- employment, not to pick up, transport or perform services.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.802" offset="21162611">So that so far as the legislation is concerned, so far as the amendments are concerned, whatever affect they may have certainly support the petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.417" offset="21209004">And that -- and we submit that that position of course is strongly supported by -- in other ways as well by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.959" offset="21251218">Now, getting back to the question of this criterion, this new criterion which the Board wants to apply, I think a question was asked by Mr. Justice Frankfurter as to what would happen in the Rice Milling case under this new criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.456" offset="21325197">And I think the answer was that if there were a separate gate and the Kaplan employees had gone -- had been stopped at that gate, that would had been illegal if there had been other contractors on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.312" offset="21404609">I think that was the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.839" offset="21410774">So that this is a new wrinkle in this criterion which doesn't appear before, that is if there is only one independent contractor on the premises for a regular period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.049" offset="21459571">It's not illegal if I understood counsel, whether there are two or more contractors, not employees, if there are two more contractors on the premises it becomes illegal.</text>
