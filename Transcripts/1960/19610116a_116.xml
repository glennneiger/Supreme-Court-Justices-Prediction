            <text syncTime="32.368" offset="232887">The issue in this case is extremely simple and the facts themselves are -- or should be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.765" offset="274474">It involves the question of whether or not a convicted felon is entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment to counsel on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.185" offset="324106">It counts the felon also being an indigent and being a man who has been tried for capital offense, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.966" offset="375202">The facts are that on April 10, 1953, Stuart Newsom was tried in the Hustings Court in the City of Richmond, was convicted before a jury and was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.339" offset="444688">Eight days later, he wrote to the trial judge noting an appeal and saying that he propose to get counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.839" offset="490768">Five days after that, on April 23, 1953 or 13 days after his conviction, he then wrote the judge and said that due to circumstances beyond his control, he could not get counsel and asked the Court to appoint an attorney for him.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.641" offset="593899">As a matter of fact, he was tried with his own counsel and the counsel whom he himself has selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.192" offset="624097">That counsel stayed in the case until the conclusion of the trial when he made a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.589" offset="665684">Thereafter, he was not in the case and from then on, he did not have counsel in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.877" offset="710928">Actually, no appeal was ever taken from that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.458" offset="729213">He did not hear from the Court and no appeal was -- was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.958" offset="747186">On January 12, 1959, that is nearly six years later, he filed his petition for habeas corpus and asked the Court to grant his petition under section -- under the Fourteenth Amendment, Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.776" offset="850526">Actually, what he did was -- no, it was not federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.244" offset="864319">He went into the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond and Judge Young heard his habeas corpus petition and in a very well-reasoned opinion, which is in the record ending at page 27, he denied I say a well-reasoned opinion as a magnificent opinion up to the last paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.761" offset="958464">And you would think that up to that time, he was going to decide the case in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.158" offset="983960">Then from that decision, the petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, Judge Young's decision and memorandum were offered and dense the petitioner the petition for certiorari to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.239" offset="1996361">Mr. Justice Harlan, I'll deal with it right -- right now sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.945" offset="2007124">I don't -- don't feel that an interruption of -- of that importance should be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.542" offset="2033560">As a matter of fact, I think that the clearest answer to the contention that this man was not pauper in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.569" offset="2077654">Is the language of Judge Young himself on page 27 of the record where he summarizes the exact question before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.169" offset="2124048">And at the middle of the page, he quotes from the -- the Griffin case, as I recall, only citing A.L.R. -- or maybe he's there citing an A.L.R. note and he says, "Whether an indigent defendant is, as a matter of due process, entitled to counsel on appeal is a question which has not yet been squarely decided by the United States Supreme Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="533.630" offset="2237942">Then he goes on down and quotes the annotation in law edition of the Supreme Court reporter and then he says, "Whether this view be correct or incorrect is of course the question in the instant case."</text>
            <text syncTime="552.278" offset="2312443">Now, the view that he's speaking about is the annotator's view that the establishment of a rule that a state must, as a matter of federal constitutional law, provide indigents with the assistance of counsel to prosecute appeals and criminal cases would appear to be no more than a logical extension of the Griffin doctrine and of course, the case of Griffin against Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.612" offset="2417768">Now, whether this view, whether this room that a -- an indigent criminal must be appointed counsel to help prosecute as a field, whether that view is correct or incorrect, is the question in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.495" offset="2473357">Now, all through his decision, Judge -- Judge Young acknowledged that on pages 24 and 25 in at least five places.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.516" offset="2505435">He speaks of -- of Virginia statutes dealing with the furnishing of counsel to paupers with Virginia statutes which relieved indigents of cause on appeal of the double misfortune of being stricken with poverty and accused of crime, and of the fact that courts of records under -- even in Virginia have decided that where -- that those courts do have inherit authority to appoint counsel to defend paupers and other indigent persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.967" offset="2643257">He is speaking and treating this entire case as though the man were an -- an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.667" offset="2662066">Counsel says -- or the other Attorney General says that he has to do that because there are so many cases that involved indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.331" offset="2688711">But my answer to that is that if he will not deal with a case of an indigent and if he felt that this should go off on the ground that the man was not an indigent, all he would have to say is that none of these cases are applicable, this man is not an indigent and therefore, I dismiss his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.776" offset="2758510">He did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.304" offset="2764570">He treated him as an indigent and he still decided the case as if he were an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.322" offset="2788707">Now actually, and I -- with some interpretation, I did follow a short file, a short reply brief in this case and I felt that since the Attorney General of Virginia had put in by 25 pages in his appendix of opinions from the Circuit Court of Appeals and the -- and the District Court of United States and other cases have nothing to do with this case, then I would justify doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.356" offset="2896750">This is a letter from the petitioner where he said that on April -- in April of 1953 when he was convicted, he had $53.03 when he went in the penitentiary and approximately $40 constituting his total assets when he filed the -- when he sought to appeal the case, and that he did make efforts to obtain bonds and was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.271" offset="3000508">Now, this is a letter from him to me, which I requested him to write me in order to give me the true facts, which I did not know until I received this.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.949" offset="3043140">So -- and then there's one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.970" offset="3051290">I feel that -- I know that there is in the record right on the first page of the record a statement that in January of 1959, he was poor -- I think it was $27 then in the -- in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.513" offset="3109386">There are those things, but I feel that Judge Young's handling the case, Mr. Justice Harlan, is the -- is the most conclusive of proof that this was treated in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.935" offset="3159124">And as I say, if -- if he hadn't treated it that way, he could have said, "Well, had the man been an indigent, I'd have given him relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.430" offset="3193083">But since he wasn't, I won't."</text>
            <text syncTime="773.727" offset="3198307">And he -- he didn't do that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.424" offset="3205099">He treated it as an indigent's case and that is the exact opinion, the exact memorandum, the order of the identical judge from which certiorari was granted ultimately quote by this Court.</text>
