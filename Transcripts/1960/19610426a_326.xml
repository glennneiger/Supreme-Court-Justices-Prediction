            <text syncTime="1236.600" offset="5049762">He was a retired army captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.397" offset="5056972">I believe they refer to him as Captain Death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.022" offset="5095424">As I would -- said the petitioner cited in a number of cases and was using little excerpts from these cases in writing his excellent brief, in checking over these cases he cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.139" offset="5159894">However, I find that they are not exactly like in facts so that they would be as we say on all force with this case, for instance, Avery versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.693" offset="5234186">That decision rested on the ground that the use of the jury courts of white and yellow to -- to note the race that constituted prima facie evidence of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.964" offset="5287267">I believe as this Court pointed out the box from which these cards were taken had an opening large enough for the judge to look in and see whether that was a white or yellow card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.858" offset="5342856">We don't have anything like this in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.339" offset="5356753">The judge reached in, pulled out a name, the all name sort of just written on the cards, similar cards, no difference of cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.786" offset="5394474">Now, the other case cited was Cassell versus Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.484" offset="5413282">That was a case where the Jury Commissioners went off on the idea following as they interpreted Akins versus Texas to mean that as long as they had one Negro on the jury that that satisfied the requirement for such discrimination -- that limitation of course, in violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.241" offset="5496351">We don't have this in -- in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.328" offset="5520697">Now, in Eubanks versus Louisiana, another case which was cited, this Court held that while the Jury Commissioners selected 75 names impartially, that the trial judge picked his grand jury from people he knew personally and had personal knowledge of their race and therefore, this was discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.001" offset="5619336">Hernandez versus Texas, that the Court after saying that the petition met the burden of proof is set out in Norris versus Alabama and said that the State has not rebutted this prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.658" offset="5677955">In -- in that one, it seemed that the Jury Commissioners just left out all names that denoted Mexican or Spanish descent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.133" offset="5735946">Now, Hill versus Texas is another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.659" offset="5757994">The Court held that the -- a prima facie case was ade out and the State bail needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.642" offset="5777951">And Negroes were omitted from the grand jury list for 16 years or more in spite of the fact that various names had been mentioned to them and they just failed to carry out their duties to investigate any of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.542" offset="5841586">This wasn't the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.847" offset="5846810">We had evidence, Mr.Depke that he had gone out in various parts of the county and going to stores and meeting places and -- and ask about people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.567" offset="5909608">I would like to point out at this time that Dallas County is a rural community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.869" offset="5938866">And your best source of information is usually a country grocery store in which you go and buy a soft drink and talk with the owner and he can tell you about everybody in that vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.137" offset="5995917">Now, there was something said in the testimony about if he didn't know any particular Negroes in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.657" offset="6026010">He asked some good white men, that may seem as -- that was discrimination, but in this area of the State, most of the stores are run by white men, the grocery stores or country gentle merchandise stores and he probably has went and asked some questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.715" offset="11498245">Now, in another case, it was cited on Neal versus Delaware, we definitely have the statute there that excluded persons that have been dissent from jury service, but of course that ever gone this face was -- this different from this one that we have here and another one cited was Pierre versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.143" offset="11587897">And this was one where there were approximately one-half the population was Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.923" offset="11611094">And that no Negro had said it was petit or grand jury in the last 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.624" offset="11625827">Now, in anytime on the grand jury and they had 300 names in the venire box, three of these were Negroes, one was a dead person, dead Negroes, so there were really only two out of 299, and they held this was discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.178" offset="11700120">Well, that -- that's a long way from the case we have before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.009" offset="11727391">The only similarity there is that there were approximately half of the population was Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.153" offset="11751946">In the Reese versus Georgia, another case cited, we -- that was a due process matter in which the Georgia rule of practice required the defendant to challenge the composition of the grand jury before the indictment, where the grand jury was empanelled, sworn in eight days before the man was indicted in that case and he did not have counsel appointed until the day after he was indicted.Of course, that was due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.461" offset="11873259">Shepherd versus Florida, we had discrimination there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.527" offset="11901471">Negroes were discriminated against on the jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.770" offset="11914428">And there was also the possible race rot and things of that nature, newspaper writings that just prevented a fair trial to the man so that was questioned in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.352" offset="11964792">Smith versus Texas was the other one that -- where they drew a grand jury in which they put the first way of names, white people and then 13, 14, 15, 16 were of the Negro race and there was a local practice to pick the first 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.464" offset="12037204">And that was just a stag deck, so to speak, there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.916" offset="12050996">Of course, Estrada versus West Virginia is the one that said that all white male through 21 years and a citizen of this States shall be liable to serve as jurors except this hearing provided and they provided for certain state officials.</text>
