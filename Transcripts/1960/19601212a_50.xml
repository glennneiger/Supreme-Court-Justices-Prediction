            <label>Mr. Philip Price</label>
            <text syncTime="42.676" offset="274056">(Inaudible) Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.511" offset="285445">This case is here on petition for review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which affirmed a decision of the District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and a case arising under the Sherman Act which was tried by the District Court Judge without a jury, pursuant to agreement of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.785" offset="370500">With Your Honors' permission, I will divide the argument, present the opening and the closing portion of the argument will be presented by Mr. Hugh Cox following that presented by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.141" offset="431940">This case was a private Sherman Act case for treble damages, brought by 40 long-haul trucking companies and their trade association, the Pennsylvania Motor Truck Association which for convenience was referred to throughout this trial as the PMTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.267" offset="512397">Against some 23 railroads and a -- an association of their presidents, those are the Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference by its initials, the ERTC and Byoir Incorporated, a public relations firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.328" offset="588675">It resulted in a finding for the plaintiff, trucking companies by the Court of damages in the sum of 18 cents each.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.125" offset="623888">A fine being in favor of the trade association for a sum of $650,000, the allowance of counsel fee in the sum of $200,000 and the entry of a restraining order in the form of a decree which I shall describe in detail presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.275" offset="700479">This case involves the long-haul trucking industry only.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.974" offset="727228">The long-haul trucking industry operates heavy trucks, large trucks which have extra loads of an excess of 18,000 pounds, gross weights in excess of 30,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.868" offset="782817">And I think it would be helpful if I refer briefly to the historical background which led up to this suit which was brought incidentally in January of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.618" offset="837883">Beginning on -- in 1930, the number of long-haul large trucks was relatively small, only perhaps 28,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.028" offset="875499">By 1950, that had grown to 450,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.009" offset="895457">That represented, perhaps 1% of the total number of motor vehicles which we use in the highways of the United States in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.487" offset="933282">And approximately 5% of those that were classified as trucks, so that it was a relatively small number of vehicles when compared with the total number that we use in the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.738" offset="998275">As those trucks grew in number, they likewise grew in size over that period of 20 years.And as they grow in size, the roads had to be increased in width.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.130" offset="1043937">The grades have to be flattened, the foundations have to be made much more firm and sound, bridges have to strengthened and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.619" offset="1081866">The truckers as a group were actively engaged in lobbying for legislation which would enable them to carry larger weights, larger loads in their trucks and to operate larger trucks themselves because in the early days, the limitations or the size of trucks and weight of trucks was very hampering to the carriage of large volumes of freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.664" offset="1177997">As the weights increased, the fees did not increase proportionately.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.478" offset="1201298">And although the roads cost pretty much more to build and to maintain, the relative value of the cost to the trucking industry of using those roads which constituted their own right of way and which gave them the flexibility, was made their business possible, did not increase proportionately.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.935" offset="1283114">And because of the reciprocity provisions of state laws, whereby a truck license in state A could cause all other states free of additional license fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.078" offset="1335672">There were many states which these trucks could cause cost and whose roads they could use without the payment of any fees at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.384" offset="1372871">A conspicuous illustration with the State of Oregon, which in the very early days and long before this campaign which I shall describe in a few moments, began, imposed a fee or fees on long-haul trucks which were based upon two factors, their weight, the weight that they carry and the distance that they carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.353" offset="1460746">That's variously called under weight-distance tax or a weight -- weight-distance and ton-mile tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.426" offset="1501080">But that was unusual at that time and states -- narrow states such as Indiana and New Jersey could be caused by trucks without paying anything, unless they happen to stop to buy gas or oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.749" offset="1558340">In which case, they would pay a small tax on the oil or gasoline purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.262" offset="1580387">But a state like Indiana or Jersey, the tax increased very largely, the size and strength of its roads and its bridges was in effect providing a free right of way for these large trucks which caused it.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.283" offset="1636498">Unless they happened to be licensed in the State of Illinois, Indiana, Oregon, New Jersey which was obviously not very usual.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.884" offset="1674951">So that to the extent that the legislatures of the several states could be persuaded to refrain from levying such tax as the weight-distance tax or the ton-mile tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.737" offset="1726360">The public at large was paying a large portion of the cost of maintaining the rights of way of these trucking companies who were therefore heavily and largely at public expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.739" offset="1774320">Studies by public officials of various states and of the United States indicate that -- that that was their conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.353" offset="1800756">And they were urging limitations, the limitations be maintained on these hours and weight of trucks or that their fees would be increased because of the enormously increased cost of building these new roads which were required by this type of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.145" offset="1863973">Thus, the right of way cost of the trucking industry was not based primarily on use or on economics but was based upon what the legislatures could be persuaded to grab or to requote.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.291" offset="1924577">Whereas, the railroads during this period of time obviously had to pay the entire cost of maintaining their own rights of way and likewise pay it in many cases very large taxes on their terminal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.988" offset="1979329">So that in this setting, the petitioners here and brought to on a public relations campaign which had two major themes.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.710" offset="2034186">One was that the damage done to roads by the big trucks without of all proportion to their direct weight and that it increased in geometrical rather than arithmetical ratio when compared with the weight and size of the trucks and that those trucks do not pay their fair share of the cost of constructing or maintaining the roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.545" offset="2145573">The question to this case is whether that particular public relations campaign violates the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.788" offset="2178487">The court below held that it did and it is my purpose to discuss the reasons why we consider that decision erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.922" offset="2211088">The public relations campaign was presented in the form of speeches, press releases, articles, magazine articles and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.696" offset="2258108">All of it except some films and purely technical fixes has been reproduced in two volumes of the record, this large one and volume three, the smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.038" offset="2319548">This size volume was prompted by the desire to present to Your Honors the magazine articles in the form in which they actually appeared in the magazines and this is the size of the Saturday Evening Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.184" offset="2384123">All of these articles are contained in those two volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.078" offset="2403662">And therefore, the material which was presented to the public in the course of this public relations campaign is all documentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.513" offset="2453400">In presenting these two themes which I have mentioned, there were only five subjects which were the subject of discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.412" offset="2489031">And each on -- in the brief at pages 6 and 7 are listed, the various exhibits by number and by page which appear in volumes 2 and 3 of the record under the category which property describes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.987" offset="2551306">And those five categories are summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.596" offset="2569801">One is support for or opposition to a specific legislated bills dealing with truck weights or taxes on the consideration in the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.813" offset="2610657">Two, the relationship between highway maintenance and construction costs and the increased use of heavy trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.610" offset="2641795">Three, the need for and sources of highway funds and the apportionment of taxes among highway users and the effect of heavy trucks upon existing highways and the prevalence for -- and the reasons, four, overloading of trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.306" offset="2708564">And five, highway dangers and congestion contributed to by heavy trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.172" offset="2732074">Now, all of those items, all of those topics were dealt with by various of these articles, speeches, press releases and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.307" offset="2768645">But since they are all here, all putted, there's no question in this case of the accuracy of anyone's memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.881" offset="2798947">There's no question about the -- the way of oral testimony which Your Honors may see just as if it were only one article, one speech, one book, precisely what was said and how these subjects or how these two themes were presented to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.169" offset="6408025">Another article was called, "history, trucks and money," which was described by the court below as skillfully designed to arouse the farmers in opposition to legis -- opposition to the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.703" offset="6470196">But the truly legislative thrust of that article is illustrated best by the last paragraph which reads, "So if you are interested in your roads as every farmer must be, you will demand that your state legislature pass effective legislation for limiting the weight of the big trucks from enforcing the limitations or for making them pay taxes toward upkeep of the roads based on a weight they carry and the distance they travel."</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.781" offset="6570506">And again, in the article, "Who shall pay for our roads?"</text>

            <text syncTime="2278.176" offset="9216084">And obviously, under the trade association, it may not recover damages on behalf of its members.</text>

            <text syncTime="2290.779" offset="9266448">And it suffered no damage whatever because the amount that was allowed on the court below was not the amount that was contributed to it by the trucking members but the amount or some of the amounts that it spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.041" offset="9315558">Now, if it had been allowed to recover for the amounts contributed by the train company members that would've violated the terms and stipulation and would have given it a reward which the stipulation excluded, but since it's only trade association and since it wasn't damaged at all in itself as a result of anything done by the petitioners in this case, we say that it was not entitled to recover any damages to fight it, and for that reason, the judgment should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.160" offset="12564041">On a radio program, I -- I'll have it -- well, I guess its right in front of me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.718" offset="12582222">Senator Dodd on a radio program just November 23rd said, "If we are to preserve this precious right of petition, it seems to me that any legislature were -- legislator weren't dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.173" offset="12620048">But I want to know who is behind the petition before it gets any weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.693" offset="12634154">To establish what's in my mind, let me cite this kind of comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.036" offset="12647528">Suppose the petroleum industry organized a petition asking Congress to pass certain legislation which really would benefit them greatly at the expense of other elements for our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.932" offset="12683055">Don't you think it would be important to me as United States Senator to know that the big oil companies were behind this and it's their employees and people who own stock in their companies got other people to sign it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.040" offset="12723493">Well I think so and I think that any petition involved in it, the obligation to any petition has involved in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.370" offset="12748884">The obligation to make people who wrote it, who's behind it, who got it signed or asked people to sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.201" offset="12768214">So I think that is a -- a very important element which cannot be divorced from this case before we get onto a case which may sometimes come before you where you have a pure legislative campaign honestly and openly putting forth only truth to an appropriate legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.734" offset="12834356">But as the findings of fact in this case made clear, you do not have such a legislative campaign in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.459" offset="12861210">You -- first of all, quite clearly have a public relations campaign which was intended to injure us in every possible and conceivable way whether or not there'd be legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.871" offset="12914813">I'll read that finding to you tomorrow morning.</text>
