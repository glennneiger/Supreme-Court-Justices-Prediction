            <label>Mr. Bernard Weiss</label>
            <text syncTime="15.625" offset="165909">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.521" offset="181478">This proceeding is consigned with the question in computing interest as provided by law that the judgment of the United States Court of Claims, Section 2411 (a) of Title 28 of the U.S. Code Section 3771 (e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which is Title 26 apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.857" offset="298820">It is the -- the petitioner's contention that Section 2411 (a) govern since it is contained in the Judicial Code, now called Title 28, a judiciary into the -- under the title, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure and the question of determining.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.694" offset="386173">The interest on a judgment is peculiarly within the province of the Court which is adjudicating a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.504" offset="421386">Section 2411 (a) is a specific provision in the Judicial Code dealing with interest in an -- with interest on any overpayment and federal tax, as a result of obtaining a judgment to such overpayment in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.569" offset="509680">I'm going to read these two Sections which are alleged to be in conflict and then I'll try to distinguish them and show why.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.119" offset="547819">3771 (e) never applies in any case where we run into a situation where the Commissioner of Internal Revenue refuses to allow the claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.478" offset="609259">That Section is only applicable when the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has allowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.488" offset="633292">And if he doesn't allow, the claim for refund within the -- those provisions, that Section cannot be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.580" offset="661713">This is an administrative proceeding when you say, “If the Commissioner determines.”</text>
            <text syncTime="145.347" offset="684805">He's not a judicial officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.467" offset="693269">Therefore, when we use this particular expression, if the Commissioner determines an overpayment in tax which is attributable to an unused excess profits, credit carry-back or a net operating loss, credit carry-back from a subsequent year, what we're in effect saying is that the Commissioner has now made a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.530" offset="801520">There is no judgment of any kind involved because when he makes the determination, there isn't -- the -- the taxpayer is in no position to refer to the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.961" offset="851257">And therefore, when the taxpayer seeks to -- seeks a refund, he has to come within the meaning of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.713" offset="886262">Now, when the -- I'm going to read these two Sections and this is what it said, reading now 2411 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="206.777" offset="930461">It says, “In any judgment of any court rendered that (whether against the United States, a collector or deputy collector of internal revenue, or the personal representative in case of death) for an overpayment in respect of any internal-revenue tax, interest shall be allowed at the rate of 6 per centum per annum upon the amount of the overpayment, from the date of the payment or collection thereof to a date preceding the date of the refund check by not more than 30 days, such date to be determined by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="246.751" offset="1090330">Now, the language of this particular provision of the Judicial Code requires no further explanation than just the words themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.576" offset="1145710">They speak for themselves, they're unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.710" offset="1162219">And what does Section 3771 (e) say?</text>
            <text syncTime="270.179" offset="1184057">It says, “If the Commissioner determines that any part of any overpayment is attributable to the inclusion in computing the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year of any part of the net operating loss for succeeding taxable year or to the inclusion in computing the -- unused excess profits credit adjustment for the taxable year of any part of the unused excess profits credit for succeeding taxable year, no interest shall be allowed or paid with -- with respect to such part of the overpayment for any period before the filing of a claim for credit or refund of such part of the over -- of the overpayment or the filing a petition with the Tax Court, whichever is earlier."</text>
            <text syncTime="320.951" offset="1387186">Now, before I go into discussing these two provisions, I want to make a short statement of what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.317" offset="1420622">It's only one paragraph and we can deal with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.609" offset="1437759">March 28th, 1959, the petitioner obtained a judgment in the United States Court of claims against the defendant for overpayments of income and excess profits taxes in the sum of $520,000, approximately, when adjustments for interest as provided by law for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1942 to March 31, 1946, inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.323" offset="1540681">This judgment included an overpayment of $211,900 of excess profits tax for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1942 of which amount $150,000 was attributable to an unused excess profits credit carry-back from the fiscal year ended March 31, 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.321" offset="1624691">The defendant in computing the amount of interest on the overpayment of $150,000 commenced with the date of June 14th, 1945, which is the date the claim for refund was filed rather than March 31st, 1943, which is the close of the year, giving rise to the unused excess profits credit carry-back resulting in several payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.013" offset="1743391">It is alleged that Section 3771 (e) requires such computation.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.539" offset="1773484">Now, interest on the rest of the overpayment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1942 was properly computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.207" offset="1808175">The Court of Claims agreed with the basis of computation as set forth by the defendant, but rendered no opinion, the taxpayer petitioned for certiorari and this Court rendered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.084" offset="1863659">Now, it's the petitioner's contention that the language of Section 2411 (a) applies to any overpayment of federal tax which has been determined by a judgment of the Court, except for slight modifications which are not material in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.729" offset="1966268">The statute as it reads today is the same as it read at that -- as it has been since the Revenue Act of 1928, when it was known as Section 177 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.011" offset="2027395">The Judicial Code was incorporated into the U.S. Code in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.517" offset="2069400">Probably, due to some error, Section 177 or its equivalent or words to the same effect, were omitted when they -- when they merged the Judicial Code into the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.327" offset="2148707">This error, however, was corrected in May 1949, when Section 177 (b) was put right back into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.595" offset="2189772">At the time that they had put in, when they eliminated Section 177, they came in with a Section called 2516, which they thought might be the equivalent of the old Section 17 -- 177.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.613" offset="2273782">But an examination of 2516 which is shown in the respondent's brief in his appendix and an -- in the next to the last column reads, 2516, “Interest on claims and judgment, interest on claim against the United States shall be allowed on a judgment of the Court of Claims only under a contract or act of Congress expressly providing for payment thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="579.258" offset="2420381">Now, there are shortcomings in this particular Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.510" offset="2437413">It must be obvious, because it only talks about the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.544" offset="2453504">It doesn't mention anything about what would happen if you had a case in the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.850" offset="2478791">And whatever the reason was, the fact of the matter is that the Congress saw fit to put it back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.494" offset="2509302">And at that point, 3771 (e), when this would for a particular provision now known as 2411 (a) was put into the code, Section 3771 (e) was in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.565" offset="2573667">And despite the language of that code, if there is any alleged difference between the two sections and we claim there is none, we claim that Section 3771 (e) applies in -- in administrative proceedings when the Commissioner of Internal Revenue allows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.919" offset="2651094">They did not allow anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.596" offset="2657782">In fact, they fought this taxpayer for a period of 14 years and refused to allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.889" offset="2682964">The claim for refund based on its excess profits credit carry-back or the two there from the year 1943 to the year 1944.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.414" offset="2864985">I know, but we're now talking about -- we're talking about this special provision which is a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.949" offset="2891212">Section 3771 says that there's any overpayment of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.180" offset="2908139">Now, the taxpayer is entitled to receive interest on the overpayment of tax from the date of overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.642" offset="2929977">It says so, but the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the defendant in this case says that 3771 (e) prevents the taxpayer from receiving interest from a date prior to the date that he files his claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.873" offset="2994866">But what does it say?</text>
            <text syncTime="723.840" offset="2998732">It says only if the Commissioner determines and allows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.478" offset="3009285">It's only when you allow it that -- that that particular provision applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.272" offset="3024436">It's ridiculous to talk about applying a section of law where you're refusing to conform with the -- with the language of the statute and that is one that -- that is the thing that we claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.005" offset="3075427">Now, this question is not an old question as to whether or not, they are claiming supremacy here of the provisions of the -- of the section -- the internal Revenue Code over the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.325" offset="3156720">The only time you go into the Judicial Code is because the Commission of Internal Revenue has refused to allow your claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.592" offset="3181693">They haven't allowed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.498" offset="3185351">Now, you are forced to go in -- go into court and sue to collect that which your claim calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.617" offset="3209801">Now, what does -- what -- what are -- and let -- let's me see whether we get any help from the Internal Revenue Code itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.665" offset="3238013">Section 37 -- I'm going to read some of these sections and then we will see whether we're coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.025" offset="3255463">Section 3770 is a section in the code which deals with the question of making refunds or repayments to the taxpayer in the case he's overpaid his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.988" offset="3319306">3771, now that he's made an overpayment tax, deals with the question of allowing him interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.640" offset="3353893">Now, when we get into Section 2772 says that if you can't get along with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and he's not going to allow your claim, you have a right to go in and sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.133" offset="3391927">And what do you have to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="823.272" offset="3396420">There are some conditions proceeding to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.628" offset="3405928">At the suit, you have to put in a -- you -- have to file a claim for refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.554" offset="3909569">There's nothing to do with judgment, so that when a taxpayer comes in and they allow the refund which is what they did in the Seeley Tube case, it was proper for the Court to say that the -- since the right for the refund, only accrues at the end of the period giving lives to the lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.715" offset="3998281">That entry should not be paid for any period prior to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.658" offset="4009984">Now, what happened in that Seeley Tube case?</text>
            <text syncTime="978.920" offset="4019075">In the Seeley Tube case, the -- the taxpayer had filed an income tax return and paid his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.059" offset="4059617">Thereafter, he -- the tax return was examined on one of these quickie examinations by reason of the fact that the corporation had gone into receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.176" offset="4104025">The -- then the Commissioner now asserted a tax -- they asserted a tax based on the fact that the income for that year was -- was under -- the net income was understated and therefore, there was an additional tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.694" offset="4166196">The taxpayer now said that since the net loss, operating loss, wiped out all of the income, there's no tax due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.621" offset="4193886">And this Court properly stated that the cause of action did not arise until the loss -- until your loss arose and therefore you're not entitled to (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.105" offset="4231816">Now, what is the -- where -- what is the position of the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.371" offset="4244877">The defendant says in this particular case that having -- it says that the three -- there are three sections of the -- three parts that would affect any -- well, that -- let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.557" offset="4309556">The excess profits credit carry-back is allowed on the Section 710 (c) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.809" offset="4342575">The Section 122 (c) is the net operating loss section, which allows you to take a subsequent year's loss and carry it -- and carry it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.001" offset="4383326">And so they say that this is one of the restraints, one of the limitations if they allow the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.653" offset="4421987">That's true, if they allow the claim, which they didn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.581" offset="4437661">And it's -- from now, the question has come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.141" offset="4459917">Several times before, whether or not, a provision of the Judicial Code takes precedents over a provision of the U.S. Code that I in my brief, in my reply brief on page 2 have sighted the Bonwit Teller case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.177" offset="4544031">Now, the Bonwit Teller case was a case in the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.694" offset="4562108">That case -- that case arose in this way, the taxpayer filed a claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.586" offset="4589693">They were entitled to -- they were entitled to the -- and the Commissioner determines that they're -- they're entitled to an overassessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.934" offset="4639117">He now signs a certificate of overassessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.239" offset="4652283">By signing the certificate of overassessment, Section 1116 of the Internal Revenue Code of -- of the Internal Revenue Act of 1928, in effect, stopped interest from being paid for any period of time after the signing of that certificate of overassessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.549" offset="4721560">But what did the Commissioner in fact, do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.163" offset="4732008">Did he pay him the money?</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.293" offset="4736502">No, he refused to pay him the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.115" offset="4743816">As a result of which the taxpayer sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.957" offset="4755205">The taxpayer recovered the judgment in the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.656" offset="4774013">And the United States Court of Claims, in dealing with this particular section had this to say, “That the papers of Section 177 (b) of the Judicial Code has amended is, where it is necessary for a taxpayer to bring a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.846" offset="4866800">So give him interest upon amounts erroneously collected as a tax from the date of its payment, then a date preceding the date of a check therefore, by not more than 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.224" offset="4904312">And if swept aside any argument in here, that the internal revenue provision, the precedents over the U.S. Code.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.167" offset="4952064">They said when you put -- the man -- you're putting the taxpayer any expense of going in there and fighting in the courts, they're entitled to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.913" offset="4979022">They are entitled to get interest from (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.135" offset="5051956">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.840" offset="5066689">This is an interest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.017" offset="5075466">It's a case that involves the question of how much interest is payable on a refund judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.259" offset="5108381">And the interest is not after the judgment has been rendered, but from what time the interest should be computed in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.170" offset="5140041">It arises in the context and the -- the reason for the -- its arising is the fact that there are two separate provisions of the federal laws which are said to be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.194" offset="5184136">The petitioner says that Section 2411 of the Judicial Code as he says, if you just read on its face, something that we do not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.824" offset="5218617">That if you read it on its face, it holds in his -- it -- it rules his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.187" offset="5236172">We say that 3771 (e) of the Internal Revenue Code is precisely applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.988" offset="5267310">Now, why -- why does this case raise a problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.024" offset="5287476">It raises a problem in particular, because you have to tell what the interrelationship of these two provisions of the federal legislation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.596" offset="5329795">And in our mind, it raises a problem, a second problem because it is quite clear that this taxpayer could have sought the route of going through the Tax Court and -- if he wanted to or if the taxpayer had wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.024" offset="5399489">And in that case, it is undoubtedly true that 3771 (e), which is at the very beginning of the Government's brief, would have been applicable and that is that the -- the limited interest for which we contend and which the Court of Claims allowed in this case, would have been the only one allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.729" offset="5470333">He did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.202" offset="5476185">I mean the taxpayer did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.026" offset="5483499">It paid the tax and then sued for a refund and it claims that because it did -- it took the route of paying the taxes and suing for a refund, it's entitled to more interest than if it had gone through the other procedure of going to the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.177" offset="5548074">I think I also -- also want to say before launching into the burden of my argument.I want to spell out a little bit perhaps more for the Court, precisely what kind of -- of taxes are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.678" offset="5602095">There is no doubt that when the -- the tax here involved is the one ending, March 31st, 1942 -- March 31st, 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.262" offset="5640443">There is no claim that the taxes which were assessed and to -- and collected in 1942 for that year were in any way illegal or erroneous or improper as of the time they were assessed or collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.300" offset="5692583">There was no such claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.846" offset="5698748">What it -- it said is that Congress, in allowing the carry-back provisions which the Court has had in several cases, said that if at the end of the next succeeding year, March 31st, 1943, the taxpayer discovers that he has an unused excess profits credit applicable to the excess profits tax of World War II, which he hasn't had to use for that year, he can carry it back and alter or change his tax for the year 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.901" offset="5822986">And that -- and he has that right under the statute and that was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.161" offset="5836048">And that his claim is that when he does that, when he carries it back by grace of Congress, therefore, he is entitled to interest from the Government, interest from -- not from the time he makes his claim that he should be allowed the carry-back, but from the time that he says the -- the right to make this carry-back arose, March 31st, 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.106" offset="5955793">Now, the answer we think and I'll try to spell that in some more detail, is that Congress deliberately chose not to make the interest run from that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.279" offset="5984528">That it deliberately chose to say, “Interest shall not run until you make your claim for refund which this taxpayer didn't do the two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.907" offset="6015039">The difference is the tax between March 31st, 1943 when the claim could have been made and June 14th, 1945, a little over two years later, when the claim was actually made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.069" offset="6255679">You will see the Senate report and in the middle of it, they're talking about carry-backs there and they're talking about this section which was put into the code on which we rely, 3771 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.515" offset="6309386">And they say there, “He must therefore file his return and pay his tax without regard to such deduction,” that's the carry-back deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.751" offset="6342405">“And must file a claim for refund at the close of succeeding year, when he's able to determine the amount of the carry-back.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.506" offset="6373439">Then they go on, “Inasmuch as any overpayment resulting from the deduction of such carry-back does not occur as a practical matter until the net operating loss or the unused excess profits credit and the future taxpayer has determined and inasmuch as it is desirable to ensure promptness in the filing of claims to inform the Commissioner that such deductions have been determined, this section provide that no interest will be allowed with respect to any such overpayment for any period before the claim therefore is filed, or a petition asserting such overpayment is filed with the Board of Tax Appeals, now the Tax Court, whichever is earlier."</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.359" offset="7680815">It's -- it's a different problem in two respects from the Carter case, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.942" offset="7703176">One is that in that case, the tax when it was collected was erroneous and illegal at that time it was collected, so that the Carter case is different in that very important respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.457" offset="7753226">And the second thing in which the Carter case is different is that in the Carter case, related to excess -- excise taxes in which there was not the double rule applying either through the Tax Court or through the -- the Court of Claims in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.684" offset="7810069">And one of the points of our -- of our argument is that Congress has been trying to equate as -- at least as between people who go through the Tax Court and people who go through the Court of Claims of the District Court, the provisions were interest, since interest was first allowed in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.395" offset="7872972">Neither those two factors was -- was present in the -- in the Carter case in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.525" offset="7893452">But if I may go back and state more generally, our -- we have two general positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.864" offset="7914872">First, the broader one and which is that 2411 of the code is a general proscription and that there are qualifications and exceptions to it which are found in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.278" offset="7964505">That is that the -- these, the provisions have to be read together as if they were an integrated body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.304" offset="7992613">And though they appear in different provisions of the code, they are part of a single whole and that the provision which we're concerned with, 3771 (e), is a specific qualification and exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.923" offset="8047052">And that unless something is found in the -- in the wording of the particular provision, it should be applied whether the case is one that goes through the Tax Court or one that goes through the -- the District Courts or the Court of Claims to the refund method of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.865" offset="8102849">And in general, we would say that the specific restrictive interest provisions of the Internal Revenue Code in which there are a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.675" offset="8134092">Someone has counted 15, of -- of various kinds are applicable, whichever way the taxpayer brings -- seeks judicial review of his -- of his proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.145" offset="8183933">That is through the Tax Court or through the Court of Claims of the District Court unless there is some specific reason to think that that particular specific provision of the Internal Revenue Code should not be applicable as a qualification or exception to 2411 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.512" offset="8253419">And the more particular position which we have which I've already stated in part, rests on the fact that this is a -- an unused excess profits tax carry-back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.322" offset="8300648">That is even though as it -- and there maybe other provision -- other restrictive interest provisions which are not applicable under 2411 that is when suit is in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.739" offset="8350281">This provision is applicable because of its history to which I've averted, the Senate Committee that they deliberately wished to start interest only from a certain time, because its purpose was to require the prompt filing of refund claims which would not -- which would be frustrated if the petitioner's view of interest would be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.668" offset="8426036">And because of the other factor that I've mentioned that is consistent effort by Congress to get -- to attain equality as in interest matters, as between taxpayers who seek review through the Commissioner and then onto the Tax Court and Court of Appeals and possibly this Court, and those other taxpayers who pay the tax and make -- and -- and make refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.388" offset="8512972">But there's been a consistent history, we believe, of an effort to attain equality as between those -- those two sets of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.226" offset="8548289">I should say a word to because I think it is relevant about the fact that this is an interest case because from the beginning of -- of Anglo-Saxons jurisprudence on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.481" offset="8593324">And certainly in this country, interest has been looked at with a very severe eye with respect to claims against the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.228" offset="9476263">Later on in the same Section, Congress provided that in the case of the type we have here, interest should be more restrictive than the general provision at the beginning of Section 3771.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.009" offset="9531434">Now, what I'm saying is that we don't think it would make any difference if in 1942, when Congress added the restrictive provision on which we rely (e), 3771 (e), if it -- if in 1942, it added that as another part of the Internal Revenue Code or as a separate statute or perhaps even if they put it in to the Judicial Code, that you would have to read them altogether because they relate -- all relate to -- to taxes and so we think it does make any difference here that there is this general provision of 2411 in the Judicial Code that you have to when you're -- when you're dealing with interest on -- in tax matters, look throughout the body of federal tax law to see whether there are any exceptions to -- to this general statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.188" offset="9712097">And here we say you find a -- a section which we think it is applicable in its terms and which Congress desired should be applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.234" offset="12200312">Now, in the first place, they think that I am saying something in here on Section 2411 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.496" offset="12229360">I want to call attention to a particular way that they are ignoring, the defendant is ignoring, the word, thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.072" offset="12263633">That's the most important word in that whole section and they leave it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.061" offset="12283591">How the taxpayer -- what are you collecting?</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.039" offset="12291532">You're collecting the overpayment thereof when the taxpayer paid and he wants to get interest, he's going to get it from the time -- from the times that he overpaid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.288" offset="12332492">Now, when did that period arrive in this particular case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.593" offset="12345762">It arrives when the cause of action arises and when does the cause of action arise?</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.311" offset="12360600">Only at the end of the year of a -- excess profits tax year, which gave right to the excess profits credit carry-back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.435" offset="12389125">That's the only term, there's no cause of action previous that I found and that's what the taxpayer is insisting on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.750" offset="12410337">We're not asking for interest in the time we paid it, why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.118" offset="12423816">Because that wasn't the time that we overpaid it, it's the overpayment that counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.579" offset="12557667">That's -- that's the section that allows it and that's the reason that they -- that -- that they're giving it to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.519" offset="12577416">They're not giving us anything here that we're not entitled to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.538" offset="12589537">Normally, it's the taxpayer requesting it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.663" offset="12606046">Everybody that sues the Government whose -- and recovers a judgment, they're all treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.189" offset="12628093">Anytime you have a claim before the -- the Commissioner and if he allows it, he gets the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.489" offset="12657351">He can restrict your interest and make a -- and gain by allowing you your claim, which he's refusing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.153" offset="12683995">For 14 years, he hit those taxpayers by over pillar of boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.474" offset="12701236">They'd -- they went around on there, they did it like -- what they're using in here is using a -- a hatchet and they're trying to tell the man he's got -- that he's smelling beautiful flowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.922" offset="12739062">That's what -- that's what going on here in -- in this particular thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.302" offset="12756616">Now, they pulled all sorts of cases in here that have no applicability whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.771" offset="12778454">Every time they cite a case over here, it's when the cause of action arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.030" offset="12795486">They come in here, they give you Section 7 of the Technical Changes Act of 1949 as if that's got something to do for the proposition that we have before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.006" offset="12839372">The taxpayer -- the Section 7 of the Technical Changes Act of 1949, they so -- they cite four cases here with regards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.069" offset="12871659">That's -- let's take -- let's care of those four cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.647" offset="12885974">The -- that provision was put in, in order to remedy what appeared to be an outrageous tax that was being illustrated against to the decedent, who was being taxed on a theory that citing property which he had transferred might conceivably come back to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.414" offset="12965073">And therefore, they taxed him irrespective (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.205" offset="12976149">How minute that refers here -- who -- minute the value was this proportion of re-interest, so they came in and they now put into the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.541" offset="13009586">They -- they passed an act in which they said that they were going to give relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.940" offset="13035081">So 7 (a) provides that any person who paid a tax on the basis of a reversionary interest which was less than 5% of the value of the property on the date -- on the day before the date of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.114" offset="13087848">That that -- that person could get a -- could a refund of his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.843" offset="13106761">What?</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.813" offset="13110627">They've put in a further condition that you can -- but you in fact, you'll get your tax back but you wouldn't get interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.592" offset="13137690">Now, why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.977" offset="13143228">Because in the years to which the tax applied, there was no overpayment, not according to the way the law read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.347" offset="13172799">The law read in a given way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.239" offset="13180322">This -- this -- the possibility of refutative was just another of -- of a reversionary interest coming back to the (Inaudible), was just enough to be able to tax into that -- state that thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.714" offset="13226193">So therefore, your cause of action didn't arise until 1949, so therefore, when you're giving back people money, you can only stop in the date of the enactment of the act and that's what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.064" offset="13271646">Now, when they come in here and they're -- they -- they quote a case in here which is odd basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.961" offset="13291186">They -- they're giving you this case called Graham versus Goodcell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.518" offset="13309471">Now, just imagine that anybody quoting a case like the Graham versus Goodcell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.420" offset="13325040">Now, what is the Graham versus Goodcell case about?</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.501" offset="13337370">The Graham versus Goodcell case where -- goes back to Revenue Act of 1924 in 20 years, at that time, we had a provision in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.125" offset="13383868">If an assessment is placed on the books by the Commission that he has to go out and collect that assessment within five years of the date of the filing of the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.073" offset="13423679">Somebody and a few -- if the Commissioner is now assessing the tax, the taxpayer wants to complain about the facts, they gave him a provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.681" offset="13458056">They put in that he could ask for a -- they could file the claim in abatement of this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.286" offset="13476551">At the same time, he did that, the -- in most cases, they'd ask you to put up some sort of a bond and at the same time, the taxpayer would go off and get a stay of -- so that the collector of internal revenue wouldn't go and collect this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.603" offset="13533811">Now, what do these people do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.573" offset="13541648">They got the bright idea that they could hold this case long enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.751" offset="13558366">The statute would expire while the stay is on and the -- and the collector wouldn't be able to collect the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.015" offset="13587414">Now, what -- why -- so they now said, "We don't owe you the tax."</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.950" offset="13603192">And then loads and loads of taxpayers got this -- this marvelous idea of how to beat the Government out of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.477" offset="13629315">And so they -- with all these delays that were -- that they -- they just file without paying the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.865" offset="13650840">Now, there is a section in the law that in this 1928 Code which prove -- at 1928 Internal Revenue Act, which said, “That an overpayment of tax, if you made a payment to the Government with respect to any assessed tax after the statute of limitation arose, you got an overpayment from tax and therefore, if you filed a claim, you will be able to get -- to get a refund.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.350" offset="13768808">So everybody had to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.381" offset="13776854">They thought that this was a great idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.887" offset="13786885">When the Commissioner got wise to this thing, what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.196" offset="13804126">The Commissioner went out there and they seize people's properties, they foreclosed all the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.875" offset="13826905">They did all that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.694" offset="13834115">And on top of that, now, they went to the Congress and they got themselves an act in there which said, “That wherever the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a tax and the taxpayer had filed a -- a claim for credit and had gotten the advantage of a -- of a state, then thereafter, any payment made after the statute of limitations under those circumstances that that constitute an overpayment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.525" offset="13933484">Now, what happens to the taxpayer?</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.321" offset="13940694">He has no -- has no place to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.947" offset="13947173">He can't -- he can't recover because the very act which gave him the right to fit -- fit the payment there for the statute of limitations as a -- overpayment was now destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.505" offset="13997432">He -- he -- they took it away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.713" offset="14006209">Now, what does this got to do with us in this particular case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.957" offset="14019166">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.710" offset="14026167">But this is one of the cases that they have used to try to establish their point and they talked about equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.529" offset="14069530">Got to help the people that have to rely on equities, when they took this taxpayer and hit him over the lot and then -- then -- I'm now talking about a -- an equitable piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.436" offset="14121148">We've got some more or I'd be back here again on --</text>
