            <text syncTime="146.990" offset="691284">Now, if this Court pleases, Georgia has to say the very least a unique and a distinctive law which is called Section 38-415 in which will be found set out on page 3 of the appellant's brief in which I would like at this time to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.159" offset="783966">In all criminal trials, the prisoner shall have the right to make to the court jury just such statements on the case as he may deem improper in his defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.369" offset="920848">Now, Georgia Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the defense lawyer has no right to ask or assist the defendant in any way when he is on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.887" offset="986885">It is our contention, if this Honorable Court pleases, that this Code Section 38-415, as construed by the Supreme Court of Georgia, is invalid under both the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.563" offset="1065671">Now, I would like to say right here, if the Court pleases, that when I first moved to Georgia about eight years ago, I was indeed surprised that this unique law but I was more surprised that while the Code Section has been in operation since I believe 1868 and there have been hundred of cases taken up to the Supreme Court of the State of Georgia regarding its logic and other factories, no one ever raised the constitutional validity of that statute until I attempted to do so in the Corbin case which is 212 Georgia, page 231 where in the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that I -- it was not properly raised and therefore refused to pass on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.175" offset="1264097">And it was brought to this Court on certiorari and of course declined.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.965" offset="1547264">However, most people especially a boy like this boy, most people who have never been to a court for anything in their life, they're tongue tied, they're nervous, the lawyer -- his lawyer might just well get up and go downstairs or outside and go and have a cup of coffee, he can't do a thing for him, he can't help in any way whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.113" offset="1699819">However, the Supreme Court has now interpreted into this Code Section that while the defense lawyer has not -- does not have a right to ask any questions, it is discretionary where the judge as to whether he shall be allowed to ask any questions or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.128" offset="1803891">Now, as it isn't -- so the City of Atlanta, the criminal court is divided in two sections, two divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.450" offset="1841194">Now, if I may point out to this Court, down at this under the hall as division number one, down at this under the hall as division number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.585" offset="1873690">Let's assume that there was a murder trial about to start down in division number one and a murder trial to start down in division number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.811" offset="1914650">The lawyer -- the defense lawyer down on number one, says to the judge, "If Your Honor pleases, I know I don't have any right to ask any questions on the Georgia law but from my help my client out."</text>
            <text syncTime="466.293" offset="1968567">And that judge says, "Well yes, go ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.080" offset="1995734">At the same time -- same at the other end of the hall, that lawyer has the same question and the judge says, "Absolutely not, you have no right to ask him any questions and I forbid you to ask too many questions."</text>

            <text syncTime="805.223" offset="3324217">Now, in a reply brief that was stated on page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.887" offset="3342921">They were -- they say and even if the Code Section 38-415 is invalid that if found this case would not be benefit since he would be unable to make any statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.616" offset="3389837">Now, my answer to that is first of all, we have to cross that bridge if it is invalid when we can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.956" offset="3423169">But secondly, I feel a no that the Georgia Legislature at this Court was to rule that that Code Section was invalid on the constitutional grounds which we had certainly asking this Court to do that the Georgia -- Georgia Legislature would immediately pass a bill which they have been trying to get them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.120" offset="3523897">Every grand jury presumptive recommends that it'd be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.415" offset="3553050">And most judges and lawyers on layman preferred to have it abolish than they give into their vagarious way of doing things by having any competent witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.841" offset="3606758">Now also, where it says that he is incompetent to show you how confusing this whole thing is on page 14 at the top of the page, of the reply brief, the appellee says, "It is respectfully submitted that the Georgia practice of the law in a criminal defendant who was incompetent to be a witness to make an unsworn statement without being under direct examination buy his counsel is not violated with these vagrancies.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.739" offset="3770284">The part I want to bring out is where it says who was incompetent to be a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.237" offset="3792332">Now in 1951, the Georgia Legislature added to the Georgia Code Section 38-1606 an evidence of following and I quote "provided, however, that this Section shall not prevent a party charged with adultery from being competent to testify as to his or her innocent of such charge."</text>
            <text syncTime="949.976" offset="3903300">Therefore, defendant charged in the State of Georgia with a crime of filthy is competent but if he's charged with murder, he is not competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.613" offset="3945827">That's how confusing it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.949" offset="3955127">That was an Act of 1951 where they simply made adultery, the crime of adultery a person could be a competent witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.940" offset="4031091">He's held in jail for about two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.493" offset="4045302">A writ of habeas corpus was taken out on his behalf on September the 4th and the trial judge set that out for a hearing on the 23rd -- the 15th day of September, 1958, which was the same day that the grand jury was meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.623" offset="4137880">Now, that was in violation, this holding there was in violation of Code Section 27-212 which is set out on page 3 of the appellant's brief and with says that any personal arrested without a warrant shall be conveyed immediately or as soon as possible before admitting magistrate and anybody held over 48 hours shall be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.348" offset="4232756">When this -- and also I'd like to bring out -- to bring to this Court's attention in the appellee's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.522" offset="4273507">They say on page 17 that there is no evidence in the record of any illegal detention, no record in the evidence of any illegal detention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.474" offset="4321259">In the record on page -- starting on page 26, 27 and 28, if this Court pleases, the officer, J.B.

            <text syncTime="1446.292" offset="5888502">The trial of this case was that two of the juror men that tried this case were related to the Solicitor that was to the prosecuting attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.349" offset="6648769">In those 12 affidavits, it says this, "They all admitted that I asked him a question of how well they knew the Solicitor."</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.399" offset="6701014">One of them said that I asked him -- yes, I asked him if he was related by blood or marriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.091" offset="6747721">However, the judge in his order overruling the most of a new trial which is on page 11 of the appellant's brief, the Court finds as a matter of fact that from affidavits of the 12 jurors sworn who tries that case submitted on behalf of the State of Georgia that the question, are you related to the Solicitor or anyone in his law office or anyone around the table was not in fact and in truth asked of the said jurors individually or collectively when the jurors were being examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.072" offset="6911666">Now, the problem now comes up though that we do not have those affidavits and all in this record because the Supreme Court of State of Georgia stopped us from doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.875" offset="6962866">That's another one of our grounds for asking from up here, where this had gone through.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.935" offset="9035107">Now, I will, later in my argument, see why I believe that is the only question, but at this point, I would like to clear up one or two inaccuracies that I feel have been presented to the Court concerning the Georgia law on unsworn statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.231" offset="9148270">As Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated, this law is a continuation of the common law possibly not quite as broad in the usage as it was at that time because as some authorities, I have studied -- stated they allowed the accused to also argue his case at the same time in addition to making such statement as he saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.272" offset="9300511">In that respect, it is not quite as broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.983" offset="9311274">However, in the interpretation given this by the Supreme Court of Georgia and in my experience since there was a statement by counsel for Mr. Ferguson that been my experience it has been extremely liberally construed in behalf of the accused even in the trial courts, and of course, I cannot demonstrate that to you.</text>
