            <text syncTime="15.746" offset="166327">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.290" offset="180537">This case arises out of the so-called Jencks statute, 18 U.S.C. Section 3500, and actually presents what we submit to be a novel question, partially perhaps due to the newness of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.018" offset="255457">The question presented, may it please the Court, is whether or not, after a foundation for the admission of a statement as defined by the statute is laid on cross-examination, is the production of that statement thereby excused when the prosecutor states that the original document is no longer in existence and cannot be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.646" offset="357961">And further, that the only statement in the possession of the Government is a report of the FBI agent in charge of the interview which does not meet the definition of the -- of a statement within the statute as laid down by this Court in the Palermo decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.568" offset="449599">Now, actually, this case arises out of indictments for bank robbery -- for violation of the Federal Bank Robbery Act and resulted in convictions of the three petitioners and maximum sentences of 25 years each were imposed by the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.914" offset="530996">The decision of the Court of Appeals, actually, does not help us in any respect on the question presented to this Court at this time for the reason that, as shown in the record, the Court of Appeals said that the pretrial report, I refer to page 6 -- 216 of the record, the pretrial report does -- the question concerning the pretrial report does not warrant extended discussion in view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Palermo versus United States and that was the subtle substance of what the Court of Appeals in the First Circuit had to say about this point before the Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.069" offset="791698">The Court of Appeals actually took the principle of Palermo out of context and applied it in its naked existence to a -- an entirely different factual situation and they did that in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.841" offset="858781">In the Palermo case, you had, of course, the situation of a statement which was demanded among others and which did not meet the definition of a statement, as outlined by the statute and ruled on by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.124" offset="915832">In our case, we have the situation where we submit to the Court, there was a statement in existence and that statement was no longer in existence and this report now was the only, if not the best, available evidence of what had formally been the statement of the witness which had been reduced to writing and approved and adopted by him.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.165" offset="1107989">He said, and I think the Government quotes it in their brief and saying there were things in there which were turned around.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.897" offset="1142993">I refer to page 23 of the Government's brief in which they said they knew that the report contained something different from Staula's testimony since Staula said it was not verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.142" offset="1191894">It was turned around and it was not written up just the way the story is, and they refer to their own pages 11 and 12 which sets out excerpts from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.255" offset="1236407">But if I may -- I didn't want to reach that point at this time but if I may, I will.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.042" offset="1267545">That imposes upon the petitioners a double burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.252" offset="1284368">Number one, the burden of proof is upon the petitioners to establish that they come within this statute, that so-called Jencks statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.317" offset="1324596">And upon establishing that foundation, as the court referred to it in our present case, upon establishing that foundation, it then becomes incumbent upon the petitioners, if that were so, to show that the Government has no excuse for not producing it and actually, exculpation if the defense would be -- the burden of it would be upon the proponent of the defense or the excused.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.171" offset="6268008">And therefore, it must be held to be prejudicial to all if it is prejudicial to any, and this occurs because of the fact that -- this occurs because of the fact that a statement might contain things that the witness did not testify to in his examination which might be the subject of cross-examination as to "why didn't you say this, Mr. Witness, when back, so close to the time of the event, you did say this?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.991" offset="6391306">And of course, the statute there, again, does not say that the statement to be producible must relate only to what the witness stated on his direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.694" offset="6430177">It states that it must be related to the subject matter and therefore, matters contained in the statement to which he did not testify to, provided they related to the subject matter, would be the proper subject of production and subject to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.108" offset="6491826">So -- and of course, there is also the position in the Jencks case that inconsistency is not a prerequisite to production and of course, the statute does not make any such requirement that there'd be a preliminary showing of inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.865" offset="6554833">So, without the necessity of showing inconsistency, as well as the situation where the nonexistent document cannot tell you -- you, Members of the Court, what was contained there in its original form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.509" offset="6613452">The prejudice, if there would be any, is to all the petitioners and not to any one particular petitioner because this man merely stated his name on the direct testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.159" offset="6667995">Now, there is one other point which I think is essential and that is the Government has stated that when must they have it in their possession if it is called for, and they say it must be in their possession at the time production is demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.839" offset="6742706">And I submit to the Court that that is untenable and we have included in our brief reasons showing that it must be held to be at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.517" offset="6785442">If the statement were in existence and in the possession of the United States at any time, then it is -- comes under the purview of the statute and the petitioners are entitled to protection from it, from the destruction thereof at any time after.</text>

            <text syncTime="2041.068" offset="8267630">If the Government fails to produce a prior written statement of a government witness who has testified, which statement qualifies under the Jencks Act because of a government agent's destruction of said statement, ought the witness' testimony be stricken from the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2101.686" offset="8510151">Section (d) states that if the U.S. elects not to comply with a not up or a producible statement under (b) and (c), then the court shall strike the testimony of the witness from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.527" offset="8573471">If we look at Sections (b) and (c), and also (a), we say that they refer to statements in the possession of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.101" offset="8619760">The Government says that this necessarily means in the possession of the United States at the time production is called on and, in addition, claims that this position is self-evident.</text>

            <text syncTime="6687.603" offset="26853752">And was it so inaccurate that maybe it should have been made available?</text>
            <text syncTime="6690.745" offset="26866395">And our answer to that is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="6692.284" offset="26872560">In our brief, we have analyzed some of these discrepancies between the Interview Report and what Staula testified to on the stand and shown that they are not substantial and that the judge who saw this report and who heard the testimony of the witness didn't think they were substantial enough either that it should result in turning over this FBI report to the defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.824" offset="26982693">For a -- one of the points was how many men were in the bank according to Staula.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.461" offset="27001187">He said on the stand there were three men.</text>
            <text syncTime="6726.788" offset="27010487">He told the agent -- well, at least according to the Interview Report, he didn't observe a third man in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="6732.173" offset="27032116">That could mean that there was a third man that he didn't see very well or that he didn't see anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.500" offset="27053328">And of course, this illustrates the equivocality that sometimes creeps into reports of an interview and why witnesses should not be confronted with them on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6748.301" offset="27096586">This goes back to the congressional purpose behind the statute, fairness to the witness in the process of impeaching him at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6759.187" offset="27140159">I'd like to point out that no bad faith on the part of the Government has been demonstrated below and I don't believe was claimed in the briefs submitted here and that we do have the court and government counsel below trying to do what they thought was the right thing in complying with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.607" offset="27245798">And that the procedures open to the defense were not completely used.</text>
            <text syncTime="6792.019" offset="27271398">If they had any doubts about this problem, they could have pursued it further but did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="7058.646" offset="28337925">As the various Justices and yourself has interpreted this matter, it comes down to the point where assuming, now, all the best in favor of the Government but taking the position, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated, that there was a statement in existence at one time which was producible.</text>
            <text syncTime="7075.474" offset="28405217">Now, if that be so, now take the evidence in favor of the Government that it was either lost, destroyed or misplaced for nothing but the very best of reasons on behalf of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="7098.576" offset="28497690">The Government now says, "Well, we don't have it in our possession."</text>
            <text syncTime="7102.391" offset="28512946">And by the way, the statute says "in the possession of the United States".</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.292" offset="28524544">It does not limit it to the prosecuting attorney or any branch of the Government "in the possession of the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="7110.406" offset="28545024">What do we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="7111.230" offset="28548263">The statute was passed to limit our demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="7115.033" offset="28563519">Now, we come within the limitations and we're left hanging in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.714" offset="28582222">And -- and I say that is -- that cannot be the intent of the Congress and as I read the prior cases in -- in the Rosenberg, Palermo, Jencks and what inferences you can take from all of them in the various opinions in them, there must be a solution and there must be an alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="7142.397" offset="28672920">There must be a sanction, as I stated in my original argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="7160.567" offset="28745644">You -- Your Honors will notice, when the time comes, that -- in studying the record, that it does appear in the record that Judge McCarthy ordered production of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7168.914" offset="28778977">He says, "I will order it produced."</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.354" offset="28784828">There's been a foundation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7171.883" offset="28790888">And then, he never referred to it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="7173.520" offset="28797471">It was left in a state of a suspended animation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7176.382" offset="28808861">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="7176.954" offset="28811160">Because we're left with the same vacuum we're left here -- with here this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="7181.674" offset="28830072">There seems to be no solution, unless our position is adopted that the solution as we -- the evidence is either stricken as is required by the statute or in the alternative, we get the secondary evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7195.344" offset="28884720">But I submit in closing that there must be a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.485" offset="28897364">The law wasn't intended to leave a vacuum.</text>
