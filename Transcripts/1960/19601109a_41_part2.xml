            <text syncTime="1987.312" offset="8052590">I would like to clear up a question or two here that has been raised by Mr. Lockyear's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.297" offset="8080593">First of all, his contention here that the things are in somewhat a state of confusion in the record as to what Irvin was arrested for and how he was held in the early part of his incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.348" offset="8140779">And I would like to refer the Court to this trial transcript that you have before you in this case at Volume 2 of that transcript, if the Court recall it it's in six volumes and in Volume 2, at page 1180, you will find there a testimony by Evansville Detective Cornett or -- I beg your pardon, State Police Detective Cornett to the express effect and it is not contradicted that he approached Leslie Irvin on April the 11th -- April the 8th at 11 a.m. and that he questioned Irvin at that time concerning the passing of some bad checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.770" offset="8350490">And that at that time Irvin admitted to him that he had done such a thing and that upon his admission, he took Irvin into custody as a parole violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.915" offset="8403048">Irvin was at that time on parole from the Indiana State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.534" offset="8421543">And it was while Irvin was being held pursuant to this arrest as a parole violator that he was then examined and questioned concerning the murder for which he was later tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.833" offset="8490715">I just wanted to clear up that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.231" offset="8496253">I -- I think that the Court should know that it is the State's position that Irvin was under lawful arrest on an entirely separate matter at the time of his holding and that therefore, he does not come under the rule that has been set out by this Court previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.347" offset="8576711">I think we might -- I think it's been referred to as the McNabb rule of the admissibility of confessions in -- in the case of United States versus Carrington, the Court expressly stated that a person who was being lawfully held in the custody of another would not be subject to the McNabb rule and that confession that he gave under such incarceration would be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.709" offset="8694157">Now, Mr. Justice Black, I believe, asked the question as to whether the same question would be presented here if this was a trial by a -- the Court rather than by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.248" offset="8772315">And it is the State's position that we are in the same set of circumstances, Mr. Justice Black, that we take the position that this jury properly qualified under the Indiana statute and therefore, having properly qualified under the Indiana statute, we are faced with this -- precisely the same question as to whether or not the newspaper publicity rendered the situation such that the defendant could not have a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.645" offset="8917974">Now, if the Court would find that the newspaper publicity was of such a nature that the defendant could not have a fair trial, under the circumstances, I think, it would be of a little moment whether or not it was the trial judge who was influenced by those newspaper reports or whether it was a juror who was influenced by the reports if it was demonstrated by the petitioner that such influence did in fact exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="4665.438" offset="18765093">On page 66, we continue that he was denied the right to be advised of his legal rights by a counsel -- a counsel or a lawyer appointed by the Court of law to represent him at any time -- the -- at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.467" offset="18825279">The said defendant was never brought before any magistrate or a court of law and advised of his rights to counsel and have counsel appointed to him or represent him during those seven long days he was held in a city jail at the City of Evansville.</text>
