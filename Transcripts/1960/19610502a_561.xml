            <text syncTime="20.328" offset="184717">Thank you very much, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.024" offset="195480">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.375" offset="212825">I want to talk to the Court about a prisoner of the State of Texas, the petitioner in this case who is serving a term of 5 to 35 years on a robbery conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.207" offset="268204">His claim is that he was denied due process when he was tried and convicted without assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.701" offset="314180">His application for writ of habeas corpus was originally filed with the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.739" offset="342288">That Court denied his application without ordering the State to answer and without ordering any development of the record of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.620" offset="385860">I don't know why the Court of Criminal Appeals proceed to handle it in that way because in other cases of this type in recent years that Court has proceeded to order the trial court to develop the facts as a basis for consideration of such an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.077" offset="471646">I think that if the Court of Criminal Appeals had had before it the record, which is now before this Court, it would have granted the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.805" offset="510621">After this case was docketed in -- in this Court, the notes of testimony which were taken at the trial in 1944 by the reporter, who since was deceased, were transcribed by another reporter and put into this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.918" offset="591078">And the charge to the jury at the petitioner's trial in 1944 was also located and is now included in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.638" offset="633919">This record reflects that when he was tried on this robbery charge, the petitioner had no attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.450" offset="657220">May I ask you in that connection please, Mr. Williams, under your law, was that testimony, and in the event of a new trial, re-admissible against him?</text>

            <text syncTime="154.558" offset="721586">The record reflects that at his trial, the petitioner pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.501" offset="741334">He testified to his own innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.714" offset="754186">And he attempted in a brief and in article way to examine several cross-examines, several of the State's witnesses, but that was as much as he was able to do in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.769" offset="814477">Under the Texas statute, Code of Criminal Procedure, which was in effect in 1944 when this case was tried, there was no duty under Texas law on the Court to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant in a non-capital case.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.376" offset="1176848">If Your Honor will look on page 3 of my brief for the petitioner, at the very bottom of that page, you will notice that the prescribing portion with respect to punishment states that he shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary for life or for a term of not less than five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.838" offset="1266709">And in the case of the other offense, it's included in the same article, robbery by firearms, again, the portion, similar portion says punishment shall be death or confinement in the penitentiary for any term.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.378" offset="1316864">And it's my understanding that that is the basis of the distinction between a felony and a misdemeanor whether that portion of the statute authorizes confinement in the penitentiary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Percy D. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="328.818" offset="1418637">To clarify the situation, if I may, on page 5 of my brief, I call your attention to the statutes which were in effect at the time of this petitioner's trial which was 1944, Article 491 and 494.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.275" offset="1484466">491 stated that there would be no arraignment of a defendant expect on indictment for a capital offense, and 494 provided that when the accused is brought into court for the purpose of being arraigned, if it appeared that he have no counsel, too poor to employ counsel, the court shall appoint one.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.275" offset="1552488">Now, on the next page, coming to the point raised by Mr. Justice Douglas, in 1959, the legislature amended Article 494.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.580" offset="1593657">And just for your information, though it has no materiality to this case that I'm aware of, at the top of page 6, I give you the text of the law that it's presently in effect that whenever it's made known to the court in an arraignment or any other time that an accused charged with the felony is too poor to employ counsel, the court shall appoint one or more practicing attorneys to defend him.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.556" offset="1697625">And although some question is to the construction of that is raised in the brief for the respondent, it seems to me all together clear that that means that in any felony prosecution, if the defendant is too poor to employ his own lawyer, the court is obligated to appoint him one.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.909" offset="1767006">But the trial with respect to which we are here concern occurred in 1944, 15 years before the adoption of the preferable statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.962" offset="1815176">And it is the contention of the petitioner that any of his trial, he was not treated fair by the judge or by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.625" offset="1853837">It's my contention that had he had a lawyer, the abuses to which he was subjected could have been avoided, the sentence which was imposed upon him might have been less severe and possibly, he might have been acquitted.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="451.997" stopTime="463.758">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="451.997" offset="1911411">Well, this much is clear, Mr. Williams, that had he been tried within the last couple of years on the offense for which he was convicted, the revised 494 would have required the appointment of counsel, is that so?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Percy D. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="463.758" offset="1958431">That's my understanding, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.490" offset="1973373">And if he is tried again, if this Court reverses this case and the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas remands the man after granting the writ of habeas corpus, remands him to the sheriff of Orange County for another trial, I understand that under that article, he would be entitled to the appointment of counsel by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.576" offset="2057697">Now, what was it that happened to this man at his trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="492.169" offset="2072012">In the first place, the State introduced without objection in the hearing of the jury and the Court allowed the jury to consider assigned written statement that included a complete confession by this prisoner which he repudiated at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.683" offset="2170128">As I read the record, the undisputed uncontradicted testimony of the petitioner and the State's own evidence, taken together, established beyond any question that this confession which was introduced and considered against him was coerced and was involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.369" offset="2240867">Let me give you briefly, if I may, the circumstances that led to his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.639" offset="2265945">The robbery, and I'm referring here only to the undisputed evidence given by the petitioner in testifying for himself for -- on cross-examination and the evidence presented by the State, the robbery was committed late one Saturday night, the petitioner was arrested the following Sunday morning or early in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.076" offset="2347656">He signed his confession the following day, a Monday in the Office of the County Attorney of Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.813" offset="2378585">He was arrested by a constable, a local county peace officer of Orange County across the Louisiana line in Louisiana after a close pursuit, as they call it in Louisiana law, from Texas to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.902" offset="2435009">And at that point, where the prisoner was arrested in Louisiana instead of being taken under -- in accordance with Louisiana law to a local magistrate for an examining trial which was this petitioner's right at that moment promptly to be bound over to await the issuance of a writ of extradition which was also his right, he came back to Texas after having been given the choice by the arresting constable from Orange County of either coming back with him or being run back across the river by Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.641" offset="2593938">When the man was -- when the petitioner was brought back to Texas, he was not promptly taken before a magistrate of Texas either on that Sunday of his arrest or when he, at latest, should have been under our law on the following Monday before he was taken in to sign the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.240" offset="2676381">Now, I don't claim that the confession was involuntary by reason of anything that I have said per se, but I think that these are factors of illegal conduct on the part of the arresting officer and the County Attorney that this Court is entitled to consider as part of the background and fabric of coercion that seems to me to exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.208" offset="2792155">Now, what happened between the time of his being returned to Orange, Texas on Sunday morning when he was put in jail and the time of his confession in the County Attorney's Office on Monday?</text>
            <text syncTime="688.689" offset="2858088">The testimony in this connection is -- is almost unbelievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.708" offset="2890167">The -- the -- in short, the man was beat, they throw water on him, they stamped on him, they -- they threw him on the floor, they were trying to get a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.223" offset="2944293">And I want -- this is the most important part of my case, and I want to direct the Court's attention to what was said at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.473" offset="2981282">He was arrested by constable named Williamson and some of Williamson's testimony is in the record at the bottom of page 12.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.121" offset="3203845">And unbelievably, the prosecuting attorney excused that witness at that point without making any effort to show that he did not beat this man during the short interim between the arrest early Sunday morning and the confession on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.647" offset="3277928">Also, I would call to the attention to the Court that when this prisoner was brought into the County Attorney's Office for his -- to sign his confession at the -- in the middle of page 17 of the record, again, the petitioner cross-examining the County Attorney, he says "At the time they brought me inside your office, I was threatened about the statement, is that right?"</text>
            <text syncTime="823.470" offset="3397256">And the County Attorney gave him what seems to me to be an evasive reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.697" offset="3430170">Another question, "You didn't tell me anything about it, did you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="835.597" offset="3445739">And then later on that page, near the very bottom, "When the constable threatened to take me out and tie and wipe me unless they got a confession, is that right?"</text>
            <text syncTime="845.294" offset="3484505">The County Attorney merely said, "I didn't hear it."</text>
            <text syncTime="847.951" offset="3495163">But the County Attorney, at the top of page 18, on redirect examination, referring to the time when this prisoner was brought in to his office the day following the arrest, he was asked by the prosecutor, "Did he look like he had been abused?"</text>
            <text syncTime="862.511" offset="3553468">And the County Attorney said, "He was.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.018" offset="3563395">He had a bandage on his head, yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="868.586" offset="3577710">And there, in the next four or five questions that were asked by the prosecutor, the County Attorney was never really asked whether the petitioner was threaten immediately before he signed the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.751" offset="3634343">The questions simply were, "Did the petitioner tell you about being mistreated?</text>
            <text syncTime="888.011" offset="3655450">Did he tell you the statement he was making this true?</text>
            <text syncTime="890.847" offset="3666735">Did he tell you he was being forced to make the statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="894.738" offset="3682304">And it -- it seems to me that if I had been the prosecutor and had wanted to establish that there had not been any coercion of that confession, I would've ask a direct question requiring a direct answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.628" offset="3737893">But this prosecutor seems to have had no qualms about the coercion that proceeded this confession or over in the course of his examination of the petitioner on page 27 of the record, he asked an unbelievably brutal line of questions of the petitioner that condoned in the hearing of the jury, the brutality which have been meted out to this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.553" offset="3869550">Down at the bottom of 26 and through most of page 27 of the record, the District Attorney was asking this petitioner and said, "Officers have to get a little bit rough with you, you don't like it after you've done everything you did to this poor old man.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.347" offset="3948753">And -- and what kind of treatment would you be in favor of giving a man that would beat up old man Myers as he said he was beaten up.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.956" offset="3979160">What kind of treatment would you be in favor of for such a man?"</text>
            <text syncTime="973.329" offset="3996714">And when my client said, "I beg for mercy," the smart question of the prosecutor was, "Just like you meted out to Mr. Myers or would have to anybody else."</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.992" offset="4787388">The burden is on the State of Texas under our Code of Criminal Procedure to show that it was a voluntary confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.316" offset="4904626">There were a couple of oral confessions that were introduced against this prisoner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.932" offset="4935137">It doesn't make any difference whether they were voluntary under the Texas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.285" offset="4952482">They were not made before a magistrate, they were not warned, and they were not signed.One of them was a testimony by a deputy sheriff appearing in this case to the effect that prior to trial, petitioner had offered himself as wanting to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.335" offset="5020714">And Texas cases squarely hold that oral evidence of a prior offer or agreement to plead guilty amounts to an unwarned confession, and it's not admissible on objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.203" offset="5656221">And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has held that whether or not such limitation in the jury charge is requesting its reversible error not to so limit the purpose for which that kind of evidence maybe considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.803" offset="5802611">In looking over the record, it seems to me entirely possible that a good lawyer might have been able to take this petitioner's testimony with respect to his condition immediately before the offense and make out of it, a well-founded issue of temporary insanity because he testified without contradiction and the State's evidence also showed that he had been drinking rum and beer and taking something called either "fematol" or "amatol", it's variously referred to in this record, immediately before this robbery that he was delirious, that he had passed out and there is some confusion in the Texas authorities on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.776" offset="6010441">We have a statute that says that evidence of temporary insanity resulting from combined use of whiskey and narcotics, it doesn't excuse the crime but it can be taken into account and mitigation of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.781" offset="6074493">But at the same time, there is one decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals in which it was held that the Court properly charged the jury that under those circumstances, there was a -- an issue of excuse for the crime justifying an acquittal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.863" offset="6450866">The undisputed evidence shows that this man was denied due process, and that he was entitled to the writ.</text>

            <label>Mr. B. H. Timmins, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1683.943" offset="6839150">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.283" offset="6852524">Initially, I'd like to begin by referring to the question just asked by Mr. Justice Whittaker regarding the import of development regarding the possibility of petitioner not asking for counsel or refusing counsel, I believe it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.429" offset="6965060">To begin with, the record begins with a question and answer examination of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.941" offset="7003094">And there is nothing, of course, in the record pertaining to whether he asked for a counsel or whether he was denied counsel or whether he refused counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.808" offset="7058578">The statement was made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.359" offset="7072789">And we really admit that the -- the basic question here is the fundamental fairness and justice of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.447" offset="7129109">As accorded petitioner by the trial court whether -- whether or not he was offered counsel and refused counsel is not reflected, and I -- I know of no way that it can be developed under the circumstances since we have made a very careful inquiry into the facts of the case by going into Orange County and trying to find witnesses who remember this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.700" offset="7270170">We -- we learned that the trial judge is dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.638" offset="7289919">The District Attorney who tried the case did not have an independent recollection of the case and neither did Mr. Sexton, the County Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.792" offset="7326490">Many of the other witnesses are dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.031" offset="7339447">This was one of the -- this was one of the principle problems that we encountered in this case as well as other similar cases where there has been a long passage of time as there was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.817" offset="7394617">We found that it was quite difficult, and in many instances, possible to find witnesses who could make affidavits to support the contentions to include as exhibit with the responses to the applications because witnesses either had passed away, they did not remember the cases, and we have encountered this time and time again as we did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.840" offset="7522722">Now, the -- the Texas law that we're concern with here is Article 494.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.598" offset="7561801">I want to refer to the questions which were put to Mr. Williams regarding the amendment to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.905" offset="7590954">It was amended in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.884" offset="7602866">The Texas courts did not construe the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.612" offset="7617808">And we do not know whether or not counsel is required in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.084" offset="7647692">My information is that the practice is not uniform in Texas courts under this amended statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.855" offset="7670784">Some courts appoint counsel in every felony case, some do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.135" offset="7699937">And so we -- we simply do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.642" offset="7713938">However, of course, we're concern with the statute as it existed in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.089" offset="7739747">Again, we think it is not significant how the statute read because the -- the real question that we're faced with is whether the trial court accorded the petitioner a fundamentally fair and just trial under the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.669" offset="7814040">We have to look to the facts in each individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.651" offset="7825951">That is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.071" offset="7859702">Now, under the Texas law, and there have been a number of cases as -- as Article 494 read at that time, counsel was not required in non-capital felony cases unless the failure to appoint counsel by the trial court resulted in a trial which was not fundamentally fair and just to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.193" offset="7960116">Now, petitioner has asserted a great number of grounds here on which he claims there was a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.393" offset="7996897">We believe that he's read meanings into the record which are not justified from the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.588" offset="8037752">He has referred to the testimony of the arresting officer, Mr. Williamson, on page 12 of the record and at the top of page 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.073" offset="8103685">Mr. Williamson testified that he had not put the scars on his body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.756" offset="8138376">He testified that he did not jerked him out of the car over in Louisiana and beat him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.428" offset="8169096">The question was raised with regard to whether he jerked him out of the car in Louisiana and beat him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.639" offset="8193964">He stated that he did not, in reply to the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.404" offset="9161017">I would say that -- that reading his testimony in full, he has denied that he beat him up or put the scars on his body in the full context of -- of the question then answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.807" offset="9230608">Now, respondent takes the position that after the long passage of time here, the State is in a position that it cannot find witnesses who were on the scene at the time of the trial or at the time of the arrest who can make affidavits bearing on the central question here, that is, whether he was mistreated in -- at -- at the time of his arrest or during his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.369" offset="9364877">We feel that the trial judge knows the elements of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.767" offset="9390477">And that his wisdom in judgment should be respected unless it's patently erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.328" offset="9468635">He admitted the confession in the evidence after hearing the repudiation of it by petitioner from the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.619" offset="9509804">We feel that petition -- that the trial judge's wisdom in his judgment in these matters must be given varied weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.139" offset="9555884">We do not feel that the testimony of the arresting officers are the repudiation of the confession by the petitioner justifies a finding that he was denied due process at the time of the trial.</text>
