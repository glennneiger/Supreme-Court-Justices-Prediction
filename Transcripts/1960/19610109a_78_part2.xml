            <label>Mr. Robert L. Kilgo</label>
            <text syncTime="4.839" offset="122755">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.588" offset="137697">At the time of the recess, we were discussing the prior decisions of this Court on related questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.759" offset="166431">We were discussing the case of Mcnabb versus -- versus the United States, merely states, as the Court so well knows that that case involved -- involved Rule 5 (a) of the Federal Rules of Procedure and this Court has held that of course your interpretation of the circumstances where the Rule 5 of the federal rules that's involved is entirely different from a case such as the other -- as this tried in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.930" offset="287117">And you did hold in that case, however, that the mere fact of the confession was made while in the custody of police, does not render inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.761" offset="322435">Now, in 1948 in Haley versus Ohio, the conviction of robbery and murder and the state court was reversed in five, four decision where the voluntariness of the confession was attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.185" offset="388159">In that case, the petitioner was arrested at his home at midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.399" offset="401011">He was a 15-year-old boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.611" offset="409788">He was questioned from midnight to dawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.441" offset="421177">No one was allowed to see him.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.827" offset="430686">He was held incommunicado from Saturday until -- until Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.934" offset="451062">His lawyer, attorney was denied the right to see him on request.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.823" offset="470706">His mother requested to see him and was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.255" offset="484394">You reversed that court and held that his confession was, as a matter of law, not voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.155" offset="523995">In Watts against Indiana decided in 1949, the case was reversed six-three.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.662" offset="566000">A confession was involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.789" offset="574568">The same grounds were raised as it raised in presents -- present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.776" offset="594526">The defendant there or petitioner was questioned day after day for several days as late in the morning as 2:30 a.m. one day, 3 o'clock a.m. another day, all day long another day from 6 p.m. until 3 a.m. on Monday and Tuesday when his confession was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.297" offset="680521">You had long and extended periods of question and into the late hours 3 a.m. -- late hours of the night in that case on six-three decision was re -- reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.152" offset="731930">Now, this Court held in that case, however, that in considering these confessions where a jury has decided the case and heard all the facts and reached this decision at this Court and considering whether or not that confession is voluntary, will deal only with uncontradicted facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.400" offset="824926">Now, Turner against Pennsylvania was decided in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.790" offset="850526">That was a murder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.609" offset="861811">A confession was obtained from the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.435" offset="881142">He was questioned three or four hours on the first afternoon, then 8 until 11 that evening, questioned the next day, five hours, the next day, four days -- four hours, the next day, six hours and his questioning on the last day ended at 11 p.m. and resulted in a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.469" offset="965256">He was not permitted to see friends, all relatives during the entire period of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.088" offset="991692">In addition, the trial judge on that case refused to charge upon request -- refused to charge the jury that they could consider the long period of interrogation in determining whether or not the confession was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.195" offset="1052191">Now, Harris against South Carolina, another reversal, decided in 1949 without pouring the Court the details, I know the Court is familiar with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.422" offset="1093047">You had there again long continuous questioning many days on a row and a threat on the part of the officers to the accused that his mother would be arrested if he did not confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.882" offset="1142888">And as a result of that threat, he confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.431" offset="1165145">The Gallegos against Nebraska was a case that was affirmed six-three, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.726" offset="1194297">The defendant in that case, the petitioner was held 25 days under arrest before he was arraigned or advised of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.545" offset="1229511">That case was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.628" offset="1237870">Stone against New York, decided in 1953 was affirmed six-three.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.640" offset="1265977">You had long periods of invest -- of questioning overnight of the defendants in that case and the case was affirmed six -- five-four.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.328" offset="1332642">Fikes against Alabama was reversed, similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.639" offset="1353958">And in that case, in addition to one week of isolation, the petitioner was kept in isolation for a week except for short periods of questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.796" offset="1394604">Petitioner's father and attorney were barred in attempts to see him.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.932" offset="1415084">Question -- questioning lasted several hours at the time over a period of five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.570" offset="1441625">Court held that -- in addition that this petitioner was uncontradictedly a schizophrenic, left school at 16 and psychiatrist testified that he was schizophrenic.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.560" offset="1505573">In the Mallory case, the Mcnabb rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.572" offset="1517693">That does not apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.713" offset="1526262">Payne against Arkansas decided in 1958 was reversed seven-two.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.551" offset="1549563">The elements presented by that petitioner indicating coercion where the -- the members of his family were barred from seeing him during his entire period of incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.049" offset="1607555">He was not permitted to make a telephone call when he requested the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.360" offset="1624795">He was denied lunch, denied the evening meal and in fact denied food of every kind for 40 hours with the exception of two sandwiches.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.264" offset="1660426">And -- and finally, to extract the confession from the petitioner, he was told that a mob was outside ready to come and get him and that a confession was to prevent the mob taking him.</text>

On August 3rd of 1958, sometime between midnight, 1 o'clock a.m., a Saturday night and Sunday morning, the victim in this case was in an automobile parked in a cemetery.</text>
