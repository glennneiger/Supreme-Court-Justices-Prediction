            <text syncTime="28.003" offset="215333">The greatest potential hazard in the operation of a power reactor lies in the possibility that the accumulation of fission products, radioactive fission products imprisoned in the fuel in the course of the operation of the reactor might somehow, including a breach of the containment, that is the shell that covers the reactor, be released into the atmosphere, be distributed by the wind and contaminate both the land and the -- the entire inhabited area.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.576" offset="373635">These fission products are more toxic than any industrially known materials by a factor of a million to 8 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.927" offset="427029">Now, a report prepared for the Commission and presented in this case, concludes that the possible damage from a major accident in a large nuclear power plant of a -- one of the size of the plant involved in this case, which containment may go up to $7 billion, kill 3400 people, injure 43,000 people and lay waste to scores of thousands of square miles of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.435" offset="573106">Now, these are not the maximum possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.174" offset="588048">The same report which provided these estimates stated also that in special weather conditions which occur about 5% of the time that if such an accident occurs during such conditions, the damages would be greater, but there is now, no known way of estimating such damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.465" offset="6797249">And for example, a -- an accident occurred, the reactor in England, the Windscale reactor on October 1957, a small reactor than the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.530" offset="6853465">And it resulted in a passage of radioactive gasses through the chimney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.931" offset="6871124">Now, the leading physical -- physicist, nuclear scientist of Great Britain declared that this accident released considerably more radioactivity, then is released during a -- an explosion of an atomic bomb of a Hiroshima type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.581" offset="6969657">Now, we're not saying that this caused the damage that that bomb caused because there was no blast or fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.614" offset="7001840">But so far as radioactivity itself is concerned, a -- an accident in the reactor of this type will cause that kind of radio actual -- equivalent to that of a large atomic bomb.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.734" offset="7078327">Now, this was outlined -- this was emphasized by the fact that the insurance industry of the United States would not provide the insurance that was indicated for this type of accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.079" offset="7139662">The entire insurance industry of the United States would provide only $60 million public liability insurance for a reactor accident, with the result that in order to promote the building of reactors, the United States adopted an indemnity provision in the atomic -- in the Act of 1954, by amendment in 1957, providing for an indemnity of $500 million for a single accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.859" offset="7274768">That is what the law now provides, $500 million indemnity that United States will pay over and above the amount of insurances that will be paid by the private companies, for the results of a single accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.663" offset="7342059">Now, I think that that in itself indicates the enormity of the problem and the horrendous consequences of an accident and the enormous responsibility that rests upon the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1983.474" offset="8037230">And -- and this of course -- that the only area in which the Atomic Energy Commission has regulatory functions namely with respect to safety and security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.080" offset="8087698">Now, in this case, the Commission negotiated with PRDC, prior to the time that the permit was even applied for or to help PRDC develop this reactor and then the license -- the -- the construction permit was issued and while the hearing was going on to determine whether or not that construction permit was properly issued, the Commission entered into a contract with PRDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.266" offset="8232417">They spent four -- over $4 million with the purpose of research and development of that reactor.So that they have the -- they have been -- they were assuming then the function of promoting this particular reactor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.449" offset="8297200">Now, in addition to that, while this proceedings go on and now, the Commission is in constant consultation with the -- with PRDC to help -- help it out and give whatever advice it can presumably and give it guidance, all for the purpose of course and we don't say this is illegitimate, of promoting the development of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.025" offset="8403466">Now, we think that this -- this essential conflict of interest, we submit, is a matter which should be taken in consideration so far as this case is concerned, in determining the weight to be given to the interpretations and the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.826" offset="8506702">Now, this we think this double -- this double function is -- must have as we see it, a very substantial impact on the way in which the Commission actually handles the determination of the regulatory phases of its responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.357" offset="13800782">Now in this case, that was -- what happened was, this happens in every other situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.845" offset="13830771">The application was for a permit to construct and operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.507" offset="13865357">At page 364 of the record, appears the original application for license, that's Volume 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.755" offset="13922408">The very first paragraph states, "We are submitting here with our application for a plus 104 license to build, own and operate a developmental fast-neutron breeder reactor."</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.994" offset="14003388">As a matter of fact, there is nothing in the regulations which provides for a separate application to operate and for a permit to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.478" offset="14041318">The -- the applications are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.186" offset="14052080">If the one application that is made at the beginning, for a permit to construct and to operate and that is what is -- the information must be presented at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.210" offset="14108191">And our position is that Section 182 says that the information must be sufficient to -- to enable the Commission to find that when the issues the -- the license that it will be -- it will be adequate protection for health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.291" offset="14180498">And license of course, includes construction permit as these regulations indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.645" offset="14209964">Now, going over to Section 185 of the Act which relates to construction permits, now -- that's on page 94 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.988" offset="14279346">This says, "All applicants for licenses to construct or modify production or utilization facility, shall if the application is otherwise acceptable on the Commission, they initially granted a construction permit."</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.566" offset="14337651">It is evident that licensees to construct are broader than nearly for a construction permit because it says initially on such applications a construction permit shall be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.285" offset="14400554">Then it goes on -- sets forth that -- if it is granted then, the -- the construction must -- when construction is completed pursuant to the conditions of the permit, then upon finding that the facility authorized has been constructed and will operate in conformity with the application in accordance for the rules and regulation and absent of finding of good cause to the contrary, the license -- the Commission shall thereupon issue a license to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.377" offset="14548929">Now, as we see it, this makes it obligatory on the Commission to issue a license or to permit the operation once the conditions of the construction permit have been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.844" offset="14618728">It shall issue a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.533" offset="14629491">Now, it would certainly not in the contemplation of Congress which was so concerned about health and safety, that it repeated the injunction on -- on this matter about 20 times during the course of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.320" offset="14672645">That they would -- they would provide that the license shall be issued if the construction permit -- if the conditions are met, unless the -- the initial finding and safety had already been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.878" offset="14726875">Then it says, "It shall thereupon issue a license to the applicant for all other purposes of this Act, a construction permit is deemed to be a license."</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.246" offset="14764387">Now, that clearly refers to the use of license in the preceding sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.008" offset="14791450">License there refers to the -- to the culmination of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.388" offset="14820916">Obviously, a construction permit isn't the culmination of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.420" offset="14837008">So except for what is stated in the very last -- the end of that sentence, construction license, wherever it appears with relationship to reactors, applies to construction permits as well as to the permission to operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4499.620" offset="18101896">And (a) says the processes to be performed, the operating procedures, the facility and equipment, the use of the facility and other technical specifications or the proposals in regard thereto, ending up that -- for the -- so that the health and safety to public will not be endangered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.777" offset="18182457">Now, I submit that on place of this language, it is clear that it relates to the operational period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.414" offset="18217044">Otherwise, the language makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.784" offset="18226552">The processes to be performed, the operating procedures, the use of the facility and so forth, but that's not what the Commission said it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.712" offset="18274200">Now, at page 643 of the record at volume 2, this is what the Commission says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.829" offset="18370644">"Certain portions of our regulations have a bearing on the safety and financial issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.639" offset="18409932">The basic statements of the standards under which the Commission will issue both licenses and construction permits is Section 50.40 of our regulations."</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.409" offset="18464998">Then on the next page, "Under that regulation, where a construction permit for a developmental facility is involved, the Commission must be assured that (a) the construction of the facility will not endanger the health and safety of the public, (b) the applicant for the permit is technically and financially qualified to engage in the proposed construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.735" offset="18562278">And (c) the issuance of the permit for construction will not involve inimical to the common defense and security or the health and safety of the public."</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.246" offset="18600312">Now, when it's clear now, we submit that this language can't be distorted to mean anything, but that the Commission had in mind that all that they were obliged to do at this time in dealing with the construction permit, is to find that the -- it will be safe during the construction period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.624" offset="18669902">Well now, nobody contested that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.260" offset="18676381">That is -- that's an act of supererogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.216" offset="18696234">Nobody challenge -- or we -- we don't say this establishes a building code in any kind, but it is clear that the Commission was saying that it is -- it is free in fact of the obligation to make a finding at this time that the -- the reactor couldn't be destructed and operated at the proposed location without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="4688.047" offset="18855581">Well, the -- the Commission was following the words of its section -- of this regulation 50.35 which I will get to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.126" offset="18891839">But, it inserted this -- this qualification which deprives of its essential meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.471" offset="18925275">Now to show that the Commission really meant seriously this qualification and so greatly limited it, we suggest you compare what it said in its final decision, finding 22 and what it said in its initial decision on the very same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.104" offset="19003747">Now, its finding in the initial decision appears at page 615 of the record, that's volume 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.589" offset="19113775">Now at that time, the Commission said, "The Commission finds reasonable assurance in the record that a utilization facility of the general type proposed in the PRDC application amendments thereto, can be constructed and will be able to be operated at the location proposed right under risk to the health and safety of the public."</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.330" offset="19204681">That qualification was not present, namely, for the purposes of a construction, provisional construction permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.311" offset="19236655">But when they came to the final decision, they inserted that qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.713" offset="19254209">Now, that can't be an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.027" offset="19259434">That isn't for literary purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.364" offset="19268838">In the light of how we interpreted its other regulations, it is -- it's particularly its basic regulation 50.40, this means that it was making a finding for the sake of -- for the purposes primarily of the construction period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.610" offset="19345847">Now, there are a number of other findings, which are similarly qualified -- basic finding which are similarly qualified for the purposes of a construction permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.781" offset="19390464">And it cannot be said we submit in the light of the -- of the background here that those are -- those words were surpluses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.121" offset="19419826">There was no reason for them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.335" offset="19428707">The only finding, apparently the principal findings on which the Government relies is number 18, which appears on page 706.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.085" offset="19471757">Now, that finding fails to say that at the time of the issuance of the construction permit that the Commission has information sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safe operation at the proposed location.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.223" offset="19544273">All that this says is that they expect to have such information at some time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.435" offset="19573112">Now, we say that this is not in accord with their own regulation, which says that at the time that there was a construction permit issued, it -- there must be that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.443" offset="19617102">Now, in -- we've discussed all of these various regulations, if the Court please in our brief, I won't -- there's no time left to go into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.038" offset="19663496">But I want to point out simply in conclusion that the court below examined all of these matters and simply has said, "The most charitable thing it could say was it just didn't know what the court below meant and therefore, it could not pass on the validity of this permit and it therefore remanded it."</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.844" offset="19750745">Now, we say that's the most charitable thing to say about this and that I would -- under the circumstances, this will have to -- this should go back in -- at the very least to find out what was the actual basis of the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.075" offset="19823679">And if I may in closing this quote, the language -- the Solicitor's language of Judge Cardozo, Justice -- Mr. Justice Cardozo in which the case was, in fact, under because the -- it was not clear and the Court said, "The difficulty is that it has not said so with the simplicity and clearness through which a haunting impression ripens into a reasonable servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.328" offset="19924720">In the end, we are left to spell out, to argue, to choose between conflicting inferences."</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.673" offset="19954082">Now, that's the very best that can be said of the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.828" offset="19970696">We must choose between conflicting inferences of and contradictions right within the language of the Commission -- Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.849" offset="20014791">Of course, we think that it goes further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.539" offset="20025553">We think the Commission has actually failed to interpret the law in these regulations properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.428" offset="20045093">But at the very best, it is so confused that it cannot be upheld under the present basis and that the decision of the lower court should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5010.927" offset="20147075">In spite of the many steaming complexities which surround this case, I think the issue before this Court at this time is basically a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.632" offset="20197857">Before I turn to that issue, however, I think I should say a few words about the nature of the applicant for license here, my client, the Power Reactor Development Company, which has been called PRDC by its initials.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.780" offset="20254490">PRDC is a nonprofit membership corporation organized under the laws of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.541" offset="20281553">Its members consist of some 14 public utilities and seven industrial corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.564" offset="20309661">It is entirely financed by contributions which it received from its member companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.031" offset="20331499">Its sole purpose is to acquire knowledge and experience in the field of atomic energy and it's doing it by constructing a developmental reactor, the reactor, which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.563" offset="20397641">There is no investment in this project in the normal sense because this is not a commercial or -- or industrial project in any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.747" offset="20438392">The money, which is being spent to build this plant, has already been expanded by the member company that it had been disbursed and treated as a disbursement to this company, to this nonprofit organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.088" offset="20491682">Under its bylaws and under its charter, there can be no distribution of any proceeds to the member companies and on liquidation, none of these moneys can be returned to the member companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="5372.305" offset="21592586">Now, it -- it seems to me that the one issue before this Court is whether or not, the Atomic Energy Commission under the statute, has got authority to issue a construction permit on a provisional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.990" offset="21659355">On the basis of lesser, a lesser degree of assurance that the reactor can operate, then it admittedly, must find in order to permit that operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5408.928" offset="21739081">I think that a fair reading of the opinion and the findings together, make it perfectly clear that the Commission did not find merely that construction of this reactor was safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.828" offset="21790699">They devoted a great deal in fact substantially all of the analysis, of the evidence to the question of whether or not this reactor with a higher degree of probability could be shown to be safe at the time that that showing is required, this before the operating license is to be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.420" offset="21881083">They plainly did not say all we are finding is that constructional safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.414" offset="21905011">They did say that that is all that one particular provision of their regulation, Section 50.40 required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.760" offset="21938448">And I think a fair reading indicates that that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.417" offset="21949001">That regulation sets up a series of things that must be found before any particular activity may be approved or authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.980" offset="21987244">And what the Commission said was in applying that regulation, we test it by what is actually being approved or authorized in the particular license.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.116" offset="22027786">Section 50.35, which is the regulation controlling here, which provides that the Commission must find reasonable assurance that a reactor of the general type proposed can be constructed and operated at the proposed location.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.293" offset="22096541">Has been interpreted by the Commission in this and in every other case to mean a finding that the reactor -- a finding of reasonable assurance of safety, but an assurance which is not as definitive as the assurance which they must find later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.503" offset="22173341">Since this regulation had at its end you will recall, specific condition that said that the issuance of an operating license or rather it says, the construction permit is subject -- expressly subject to the submission of the missing information and to the determination that the final design is safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.100" offset="22263724">This is plainly what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.388" offset="22272920">And I submit that the only question which is before the Court is one of statutory interpretation, does this regulatory scheme which the Commission has applied to developmental reactor is that valid under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.898" offset="22342928">Now, when I say developmental reactors, I think we must realize that while 50.35 of the regulations does not distinguish between commercial reactors, which are licensed under Section 103 and developmental reactors under 104 in words, it plainly intends to draw that distinction because this procedure is only available in cases where because of the nature of the project, there is insufficient, the -- the applicant is unable to submit all the information at the start.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.181" offset="22492139">The very first words of Section 50.35 of the -- of the Commission's regulations as they are set out in the Government's brief provides where because of the nature of a proposed project, an applicant is not in a position to supply initially all of the technical information otherwise required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.488" offset="22589315">Then this procedure which calls for a lesser determination of safety is to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.132" offset="22619930">But now in other cases, where the applicant is in a position to submit all of the information at the start, 50.35 is not applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="5811.997" offset="23351359">That has always been the case where the particular reactor presented novel features that had not been completely proved out before they started.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.537" offset="23385527">However, a great many of these as the Commission pointed out in its decision, really represent production line models.</text>

            <text syncTime="5877.881" offset="23614882">The Commission could still refuse to give the operating license.</text>

            <text syncTime="5885.787" offset="23646542">There's no possible doubt that if after a reactor has been running for 15 years, it's discovered that there's an unknown inherent safety defect in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5913.718" offset="23758242">Now, it is not feasible with large developmental reactors even to make the definitive determination that the reactor can be operated at its full power when the reactor has been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5930.363" offset="23824802">The Commission has a whole, another series of steps in its procedure of which the provisional construction permit is only the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.302" offset="23852596">That's the only one involved here, but the others were imported because it's an integrated system.</text>

            <text syncTime="5974.684" offset="24002121">You may do this with the relatively conventional reactor in one or two or three steps.</text>

            <text syncTime="5983.345" offset="24036707">The -- the point is that the Commission has developed that procedure in Section 50.57 of its regulations which in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.006" offset="24075368">And that this procedure fits hand in glow with its provisional construction permit procedure to provide a series of safety reviews starting from the time you dig dirt until the final time when you operate the reactor at full power.</text>
