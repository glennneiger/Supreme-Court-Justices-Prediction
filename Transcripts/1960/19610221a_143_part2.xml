            <label>Mr. Edward L. Carey</label>
            <text syncTime="1.770" offset="110425">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.365" offset="136861">Mr. Justice Stewart, in reply to your inquiry, you asked about what the prejudice was by his taking the stand at the third trial and not at the first and second.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.574" offset="185657">Well, the -- the prejudice as we see it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.695" offset="202167">In -- in the third trial, we depend on the basis that this man was a mental defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.529" offset="237484">Being a mental defective, he came within the ruling of the Durham opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.982" offset="267264">Now, he could not have taken the stand at the first trial and demonstrated that he was a mental defective because it was at the rule of law in the District of Columbia at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.304" offset="320554">So we say it is prejudice to suggest to the jury that this man was consistently a mental defective and having the right to take the stand at the first trial in 1952 and demonstrate he was a mental defective just wasn't correct because he couldn't demonstrate as a mental defectiveness in 1953 because it wasn't the rule there at the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.047" offset="415535">So, we suggest and so suggesting to the jury, "This is the first time you have taken the stand."</text>
            <text syncTime="84.752" offset="442389">That jury doesn't have the right to assume if they believed the prosecutor in this absolute representation which he made that this man didn't take the stand at the first trial when he could have and he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.326" offset="496724">So, we say that presents a prejudicial aspect to the prosecutor's comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.788" offset="538520">And the Court of Appeals in affirming the opinion or the judge in the lower court said and it's on page 2 of our reply brief, I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.188" offset="588152">It says, "In short, for that purpose, the question while relevant and competent was of only of marginal materiality and opposing of it could be justified under Grunewald only if did not in fact have collateral prejudicial effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.437" offset="673102">If it did -- the Government, "If it did, we concede as we noted the outset, the question should not have been asked."</text>
            <text syncTime="151.232" offset="708315">However, the Court of Appeals said, "As we see it, the challenge question bears on the appellant's credibility and in some degree whether he's guilty of the acts charged."</text>
            <text syncTime="162.894" offset="754918">So, you now have an entirely different position taken by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.189" offset="772159">They don't adopt the Court of Appeals' majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.377" offset="788877">They now concede that this question, asked of the defendant Stewart, was of marginal materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.297" offset="828583">I'd like to quote from the opinion of this Court in the Grunewald case and I quote, "We are not mindful of the question whether a prior statement is officially inconsistent to be allowed to go to the jury on the question of credibility, is usually within the discretion of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.077" offset="915728">But where such evidentiary matter as we contend this particular aspect as -- as grave constitutional overtones as it does here, we feel justified."</text>
            <text syncTime="215.418" offset="965047">An exercise in this Court supervisory control to pass in such a question, this is particularly so because in this case, the dangers of impermissible use and the Government almost concede it's impermissible, because they say it has limited value, it's a marginal materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.747" offset="1054386">The Court says, "Because in this case, the dangers of impermissible use of this evidence far outweighs whatever advantage the Government implied of derived from it if properly used."</text>
            <text syncTime="250.116" offset="1103809">We find ourselves in that particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.343" offset="1124707">I'd like to say too -- further, the difficulties as I see this particular case is this -- the difficulties are.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.278" offset="1164518">Here's a man, exercises a constitutional right to stay off the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.142" offset="1187924">He stays off the stand at the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.343" offset="1200776">The third time, he takes the stand and the jury is reminded of that particular fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.754" offset="1230346">What persuasive effect does that position have on the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="286.446" offset="1249155">Does he take the stand at the first trial or does he not?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.805" offset="1266604">He maybe under compulsion to take the stand every time, this type -- despite the fact as a constitutional right not to do so, because if he doesn't take the stand at the first trial, the danger is always imminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.632" offset="1321880">That if he does take the stand at the second trial, he'll be reminded of the fact and so well the jury that you would an opportunity in a prior occasion when you were tried for this particular crime and you did nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.206" offset="1372244">We say that if a man exercises such right, he should never be placed in an embarrassing situation where the prosecutor has the right to remind him of taking that constitutional position.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.262" offset="1460433">So gentlemen, we say on those bases, we ask that this judgment be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.488" offset="2517347">In any event, those three possibilities were open and the second question that is left in this case now is, "If should one of those three other alternatives have been followed here," so that it would not be error to grant the mistrial -- refused to grant the mistrial even though there might be some small likelihood of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.172" offset="2612015">At the outset, if Your Honor please, we say that here, the jury never was in fact told that the defendant did not testify in the prior trials.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.648" offset="4022000">He did get certain information from the appellant on that subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.016" offset="4039450">He got the information, for instance, from a question, "Were you over there earlier yesterday?"</text>

            <text syncTime="999.249" offset="4100368">And the question, "You walked over there to where you are now like you got up," he says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.799" offset="4158568">So that the prosecutor in testing the memory of this witness did receive answers, and the prosecutor then came to the question which had been asked of him on direct examination by his counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.469" offset="4221262">And he answered, "Well, I don't care how many occasions, how many case, you say case, I was on case, ma'am, once in a time."</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.540" offset="4249579">It was at that point having gone at the same subject matter that the witness had previously indicated that he had not been tried, that the prosecutor asked a question here in issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.417" offset="4409031">And then the Court injected Mr. Carey, petitioner's counsel meaning, "Do you have anything or redirect anything further?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.960" offset="4439228">In which Mr. Carey responded, "That is all."</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.387" offset="4448946">The witness continuing to interject said, "Ask me?"</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.130" offset="4487920">The witness having left the witness stand, Mr. Carey, at that point then brings up the beginning of the ruling here in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.531" offset="4517491">He asked, leave to approach the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.863" offset="4526791">He's granted leave to approach the bench, and at the bench that he does make his motion for the mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.314" offset="4552600">That's the only form of relief that he did request so that the setting in which there was even the -- the lead to request to go to the bench did not come out of it a normal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.840" offset="4606725">There was nothing in that setting would call the attention of the jury to the fact that they should think back to the last question and -- other prosecutor and tried to figure out if there was anything they should draw from it because the proceedings had terminated in a very normal fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.044" offset="4675584">The witness having come from the witness stand, then there was this normal request of -- for leave to go to the bench for a conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.272" offset="4716440">Also, we might point out, Your Honors that the Court here, the District Court, we think also viewed the matter in the context of a memory testing situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.268" offset="4760430">The Court didn't say, "I didn't hear that question or I haven't heard any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.492" offset="4785298">I didn't hear the last question."</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.898" offset="4790941">The Court said, "He didn't say that," meaning that the Court was, to me at least, and where the Court has been alert, they've been thinking in terms of the "do you remember" type of question and had lost its focus -- his focus on the content or the subject matter of the question, focusing only on the memory testing aspect, "Do you remember?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.811" offset="4894595">We think also here that the lack of impact on this jury is demonstrated by the actions of defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.926" offset="4931062">He made his request for mistrial and he left the matter rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.531" offset="4949452">He did not do anything which would have brought the matter to the attention of jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.547" offset="4969514">For instance, he did not even ask for the minimum relief but if Your Honor please, instructed the jury simply in terms of, "Please strike the last question and answer from your minds and disregard it," which would not have refreshed as the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.407" offset="5024998">But those who -- jurors who did remember would've been told to forget it, he did not ask for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.915" offset="6571029">It takes in addition to the bare knowledge of the fact, it takes some suggestions somewhere that the jury should take that bare bit of knowledge and make some adverse inference from a second inference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.909" offset="7539022">And in answer to that, if Your Honor please, I think it -- it's -- it comes down to simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.940" offset="7563160">This jury didn't know what the truth of the matter was namely that the competency in -- of this individual had been tested just prior to this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.916" offset="7599000">He'd been declared competent and he'd been declared the malingerer by the trial court as upon the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.003" offset="7619375">Jury didn't know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.610" offset="7625853">They had an individual before him who put on this act that is involved here, so that the jury had before it a man by his action saying -- I mean competent, I'm just -- I just can't answer -- formulate answers to questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.505" offset="7693354">And the additional information that at prior trials, he had not taken a stand, so that the jury had before frankly the proposition that the man has been acting inconsistently, he took the stand before, he does -- he didn't take it before, he does take it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.055" offset="7763571">One way to solve that is that the jury says, "Inconsistency is the whole mark of the type of man which he has been displaying to us, namely a man which is not capable of any rational act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.258" offset="7824384">So that here, it would be impossible for the jury to reach any satisfactory solution to whether the man was competent or not, it's -- it's an inference we think which close normally from either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.088" offset="7875688">The jury has to decide from some fact other than this fact, because the jury can't say, go through the usual rationale that he would have the prior jury he was not guilty if he wasn't guilty because here, the thing that breaks that line of thought is that we don't have a rational man operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.540" offset="7973491">He tells us he's not a rational man, thus we cannot attribute to him the rationality that he would've told the jury he was innocent if he wasn't guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.234" offset="8008286">The rationality or the alleged irrationality of this man breaks it so that jury could not come to the conclusion while he would've told the prior jurors that he was innocent, but for the fact that he's guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.578" offset="8065651">The jury in this case did have to resolve that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.359" offset="8080802">They had this witness before him, who was putting on emissivity of evidence and the jury was attracted to that, they no doubt had the question and the forefront of those thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.382" offset="8124897">Is he telling the truth that when he acts crazy or is he not telling the truth when he acts crazy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.922" offset="8147048">So that here, the jury, in resolving that question would've had to drawn or what actually constituted the whole of the last three days of this trial, because that issue of whether or not he's competent to stay in trial, and whether or not -- indeed, he was putting an act before this jury, was a subject of much proof and many witnesses during the remaining days of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.239" offset="8256345">And it would be on the basis of this proof that the jury would reach the answer to what was the question, perhaps in the forefront of their thinking, namely is he competent or is he putting on an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.465" offset="8305246">From that question, they could answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.520" offset="8313501">And once they have answered that question, then they could perhaps answer the problem of whether he would've taken the stand in prior trial but with the fact that he was guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.913" offset="13895032">I should like to suggest to the Court that I think it's the most extraordinary position for the Government of United States to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.591" offset="13925752">When the prosecutor said to the defendant, "This is the first time you've taken the stand, isn't it Willie?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.663" offset="13970056">And Willie says, "What?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.672" offset="13974026">and the question is repeated, the representation is again made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.663" offset="13993984">Now, the Government's brief, they say, "This is for the purpose of memory testing."</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.810" offset="14018644">They further suggest the prosecutor had the right to assume a false premise in order to mislead the defendant in answering a question which might destroy his defense of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.516" offset="14081442">I think that conduct has been condemned by this Court in the Berger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.846" offset="14102758">I think no Assistant -- United States Attorney has the right to frame a question which isn't based on factual and accurate evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.834" offset="14138702">The Government says, namely his premise was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.477" offset="14157302">Well, I say, that is totally incorrect, that should never be done.Now, we get to the proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.978" offset="14203277">They suggest that his -- his behavior at the third trial was different than his behavior at the first two trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.480" offset="14245282">There's no extrinsic evidence before this Court to so support that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.708" offset="14278196">If the Government wanted to support the proposition that his demeanor at the third trial was different than his demeanor at the first and second trial, there are ways or there were ways to have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.489" offset="14337337">That was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.863" offset="14346846">They could've subpoenaed or they could've brought in United States Marshals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.315" offset="14364609">They could've brought in the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.091" offset="14375685">They could've found out other people who are present at the first and second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.980" offset="14399300">Having not done that, I do say now, they not -- cannot contend that his behavior at the third trial was inconsistent with his behavior at the first and second trial because his behavior was not in evidence at the first and second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.060" offset="14487594">Our position gentlemen is that the risk of prejudice as indicated in the Grunewald case is too great for the prosecutor to have asked this particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.298" offset="14548616">The Government concedes it has -- of negligence -- negligible importance of marginal materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.554" offset="14585605">But haven't taken that chance, they asked this man about the exercise of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.609" offset="14617788">We say that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.925" offset="14627088">The Government continually insists that the jury paid no attention to this particular factual representation by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.247" offset="14664391">Upon what do they premise that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.277" offset="14676511">They say because the Court didn't hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.995" offset="14691349">What in fact that had upon the jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.515" offset="14701484">This Government cannot speculate because -- and we went to the bench and the record will so indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.047" offset="14727607">I made a motion for a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.751" offset="14746415">And I said, I would like -- I'm reading from the record, page 140.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.107" offset="14763760">"I don't think this jury should be reminded of the fact, this is the first time he has taken the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.626" offset="14793853">What happened in the other trials is no concern of theirs at all, it is highly prejudicial."</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.528" offset="14825514">That was the position we took then, that's the position we take now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.198" offset="14848188">The Court then Judge Letts said when I made that representation, "That wasn't mentioned, was it?"</text>

            <text syncTime="3698.040" offset="14895522">I would like to have you read it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.966" offset="14903254">The Court, "The conviction?"</text>

            <text syncTime="3705.564" offset="14925615">This is the first time you have taken the stand, Willie, isn't it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.710" offset="14938258">Then the prosecutor says this -- the Government now says the prosecutor didn't mean what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.219" offset="14964276">I presume the prosecutor is familiar with the Fifth Amendment which allows a man to exercise his freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.433" offset="14997086">I think that's fundamental in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3729.896" offset="15023000">I would suggest that every Assistant United States Attorney is familiar with the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.195" offset="15044106">Smithson says, "I think that is a fact that the jury is entitled to know."</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.799" offset="15074617">In so many occasions, they refer to the record of the first case or the second case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.141" offset="15131982">Now, the Government says, when Mr. Smithson says, "That is a fact."</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.872" offset="15154866">What is he talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.897" offset="15162911">The basis of my motion for a mistrial, the fact that the prosecutor said, "This is the first time you have taken the stand, isn't it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.564" offset="15197602">The prosecutor follows up and said, "That is a fact which this jury is entitled to know."</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.955" offset="15231143">We can't quibble about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.075" offset="15239711">There's no ambiguity about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.795" offset="15250578">It reached with clarity as I see it because we knew what he meant and what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.708" offset="15286209">My final -- the Grunewald case and I should like to read this again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.313" offset="15308675">The Court says, "I can think of no special circumstance."</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.454" offset="15325184">The concurrent opinion, "I can think of no special circumstances that would justify use of a constitutional privilege to discredit or convict a person who asserts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.832" offset="15378683">The value of constitutional privilege is largely destroyed and persons can be penalized for relying on them.</text>
