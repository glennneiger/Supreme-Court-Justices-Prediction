            <text syncTime="4.034" offset="119515">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.178" offset="132054">Before proceeding my argument further, I'd like to go back to the question of Mr. Justice Brennan, and I was suggested during the recess that I may not have made my answer clear or may have not answered it correctly or may have been misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.420" offset="201017">In regard to the direct sales, I meant my answer to mean that there was a power to regulate the transportation, but not the rates for such direct sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.785" offset="242500">I don't know whether my answer meant that to you or not, but that is the correct answer and that's what I intended by my answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.629" offset="277922">Now the Court of Appeals didn't think that the Hope Natural Gas case was of any help in the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.094" offset="339780">Although they referred to it, we think that it followed -- it did not decide this particular question, you recall in that opinion, the Court did say that while conservation was not a factor in determining just and reasonable rates, and there were two strenuous dissents in which Mr. Justice Jackson went at some length, talking about the importance of conservation in preserving this important fuel for superior uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.757" offset="462451">And Mr. Justice Frankfurter also brought the dissent and joined in Mr. Justice Jackson's dissent there.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.242" offset="496306">But in addition, the Court in the opinion went into the fact that in a transportation case and certification, that under Section 7, it was proper to consider conservation considerations and the Power Commission had that power and referred in a footnote to statements by the Power Commission in that regard.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="160.693" offset="746141">In other words, if this gas had been purchased as it was in Texas by Consolidated Edison and transported by a ship, by a tanker around through the Gulf of Mexico and at the coast of New York and delivered to Consolidated Edison up there, The Federal Power Commission wouldn't be in the picture at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.713" offset="818239">No, I don't concede that point, Mr. Justice Stewart, because the Act says transportation interstate; it doesn't say by pipeline.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="190.794" offset="866513">So it's still a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.992" offset="871320">Now the examiner did use that example as though it would be conceded that there was no right to regulate, but the Act is specific in its terms in saying transportation interstate and we certainly would insist that while it hasn't been ruled on by the parties.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="209.870" offset="942895">There -- I think there are some possibilities of liquid gas and in relatively small amounts and it, as we say in the footnote to our brief, is a developing industry, and so -- but we do not concede, and we make it expressed in the brief that we do not concede that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.438" offset="1017083">Now the East Ohio case was completely disregarded by the Court of Appeals, it didn't even refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.158" offset="1044041">And you recall there the -- there was a basic issue in regard to whether or not, there had to be a coupling of the regulation of rates with transportation, in order to be able to control or have the power to control the transportation and the Court held two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.163" offset="1128051">One, was the right to regulate the rates within the State and also the power to certificate, power in the Commission, to certificate the transportation independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.702" offset="1178206">And in the Hinshaw Amendment when the Congress choused the holding of the Court in regard to the right to regulate the rates intrastate in such a transaction, it did not change at all, the power of the Commission to, as it was recognized by this Court, to control the transportation featured by the certification under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.888" offset="1278934">Now, it's claimed that despite all of this, it is unreasonable; it's arbitrary because there isn't any showing that anybody else is going to do what the Consolidated Edison is trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.448" offset="1353122">In the first place, they assumed that that price is so high $19.25 and the Transco prices were substantially less at the time that nobody else will be attracted to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.818" offset="1394604">Now, in taking -- you have to take into account in that regard, that Transco has raised its price twice so that now, with the compromised rate, and they haven't got a final rate on the last application, the rate is $37.06 as I recall against a little over $42, it's about in half.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.745" offset="1490317">I think it is $42.50 for this, with the transportation charge and the cost of the product together.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.555" offset="1517589">So that there's about five cents differential as distinguished from what it was more than 10 or 12 cents before.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.586" offset="1553742">So that the closer it gets to that $42.50 rate, the more attractive this is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.195" offset="1576103">But beyond that, at the very time, they had an application for boiler fuel in a substantial amount before the Commission, for VEPCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.788" offset="1614555">They had testimony of Long Island Lighting that they had been trying to make direct purchases, so that they could be able to have a comparable transaction to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.418" offset="1661053">They had testimony that Transco had told its other large consumers that they had better try to see what they could do by buying directly and handling the same kind of X-20 transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.462" offset="1721240">They had the testimony that public service of New Jersey had been informed that if they'd -- if this was approved, they better get busy and buy directly too.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.243" offset="1764394">They had the due power application in regard to use of large quantities of boiler fuel for that power operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.859" offset="1802846">They had the -- they have the present applications of El Paso Natural Gas to use for their compressors, large quantities of boiler fuel by direct purchase and a claim that they're exempt from regulations just like the X-20.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.665" offset="1874004">And now, the Southern California Edison has come out for some 335,000 Mcf. per day that they want to take around through Mexico and up the coast in order to avoid the regulation by the Federal Power Commission at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.596" offset="1949759">Now, this is a crucial issue to the Federal Power Commission of its power to determine in the interest of this country, whether or not, this gas shall be used in such a manner that it is not in the public interest and convenience and necessity or is, and the statute says that, "Unless, it is required by the present or future public convenience and necessity of the country, that it shall be denied, is that specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.616" offset="2085804">And this power should be recognized in the Commission in accordance with its holding."</text>
            <text syncTime="501.724" offset="2110255">I'd like to reserve the rest of my time and I've divided part of it with my co-counsel.</text>

          <turn speaker="jerome_j_mcgrath" startTime="515.375" stopTime="631.190">
            <label>Mr. Jerome J. Mcgrath</label>
            <text syncTime="515.375" offset="2164903">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.946" offset="2179114">I would like to advert to one preliminary matter, it was brought up by the Solicitor and in the questioning of Mr. Justice Brennan, having to do with the CD-3 gas as compared to the X-20 gas, that is the subject matter of Con Edison's and Transco's application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.202" offset="2260198">Now the CD-3 gas is so-called contract demand gas, which the distributor, served by the Pipe Line Company, can use for distribution, for resale to the general consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.528" offset="2321533">However, it has a limitation in the tariff which restricts the use of that gas as boiler fuel to a certain limited volume per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.862" offset="2366777">So that the pipeline company can take that gas end use it for storage purposes during the warmer periods of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.955" offset="2399169">Now, because of that specific limitation in Transco's tariff in the CD-3 -- under the CD-3 rate, it was precluded from using the 25,000 Mcf. of that per day in the boilers at the waterside station in boiler 71 and 72.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.326" offset="2484642">Now, under the X-20 transportation arrangement, Transco is given the privilege which none the other customers of the pipeline company have to not only have the X-20 transportation gas but equivalent volumes on a 60-day basis of CD-3 gas unrestricted as to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.160" offset="2575966">In other words, the boiler fuel limitation is removed and so is the restriction that the producers imposed on the X-20 gas removed, so that it can be distributed to the general public.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="631.190" stopTime="633.704">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="631.190" offset="2628106">What does that have to do with the basic issue in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_j_mcgrath" startTime="633.704" stopTime="820.962">
            <label>Mr. Jerome J. Mcgrath</label>
            <text syncTime="633.704" offset="2638137">It -- it has this to do only Mr. Justice Stewart that Con Edison seems to place great emphasis and did so at the Commission in trying to promote this X-20 arrangement, otherwise, I don't say it has anything to do with the specific issue that's before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.266" offset="2720475">The -- adverting now to the ruling of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.443" offset="2741164">The Third Circuit's ruling is much broader and transcends the particular issues that are in this case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.706" offset="2782229">The ruling of the Third Circuit is that the Commission has no power whatsoever to consider end use conservation matters in its -- in the exercise of its certificate powers under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.837" offset="2838758">Now that not only applies to the transportation of gas, but this was made clear in the Lynchburg case decided several months later, it applies to the resale gas as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.696" offset="2890167">The decision completely ignored as the Solicitor General stated, one of the primary objectors of the 1942 Amendment to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.435" offset="2929142">Now this Court will recall as it outlined in the Hope case that the 1942 Amendment was bought about at the insistence of the Commission, competitive fuel industries, the gas industry itself, because of the specific limitations on the Commission's authority under the old act, the 1938 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.396" offset="3012942">Now the broadening of the Commission's powers in 1942 was to enable the Commission, number one, to give consideration to the broad, social, and economic effects of the use of various fuels with which natural gas, as a fuel, would be competing and to take into account the conservation aspects of the problem, recognizing that natural gas was an exhaustible natural resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.696" offset="3150137">Now one of the first cases that came up under the Act was the Kansas Pipe Line and Gas Company case in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.385" offset="3196949">And it was that case in which the Commission held, it didn't have this authority and it was that case which brought about the 1942 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.876" offset="3226833">Now our interest in this case, as a competitive fuel, is that Congress has expressed concern over the fact that the expansion and extension of natural gas lines into competitive areas may have an impact on existing fuel, existing methods of transportation, which, in the broad overall public interest to the United States, should be given consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.548" offset="3329546">Now if the Third Circuit's ruling is to be upheld, that would strike out completely any authority of the Federal Power Commission to give effect to end use considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.397" offset="3480952">There was a testimony of the witness Thomas which set forth the comparative fuel prices and it indicated that the cost of the X-20 gas was in the neighborhood of 42 cents roughly and the coal that was used at the waterside station was in the neighborhood of about $42.06 per million Btu.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.576" offset="3593697">They are very close in cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.429" offset="3605086">In other stations of Consolidated Edison, however, coal cost range anywhere from 37 cents per million Btu up to 40 or not maybe with per million Btu, gas cost, the valley gas that they use, interruptible gas that Con Edison use, is around by, if I am correct, about 34.5 cents per million Btu.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.132" offset="3719920">Yes, I would say that Your Honor, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.968" offset="3731205">Now the particular case that was confronting the Commission in this proceeding was but another manifestation of a new trend in the gas industry by which producers of gas were seeking outlets which were -- would not subject them to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.825" offset="3838621">As this Court would recall in the Phillips decision, it was held that producers who sell their natural gas in interstate commerce for resale, are subject to FPC jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.238" offset="3888358">Immediately before this case was -- this application was filed with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.735" offset="3910301">The Commission had considered a similar transportation arrangement that of Houston Texas Gas and Oil Corporation to bring gas to under Florida. Florida Power Corporation, Florida Power &amp; Light Company purchase gas in the field, engages the pipeline company to transport it, substantial volumes to market, and that was an effort by the producers to get around FPC jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.966" offset="4007267">At the time this case was pending, Transco had an application to transport gas from Louisiana to Virginia Electric and Power Company for use as boiler fuel in the power plant of Virginia Electric and Power Company in Possum Point, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.627" offset="4057840">Duke Power Company, as the record shows, was negotiating with producers for transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.940" offset="4079156">As Mr. Rankin pointed out, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company was thinking about doing -- going into the same type of arrangement, but as the record shows in the testimony of the witness Bonaface, they were awaiting to see what the Commission did with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.741" offset="4142373">Long Island Lighting Company, another large distributor and power company in the east, was negotiating for transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.506" offset="4173406">All of which would have had a serious impact on the coal industry by a reason of the use of this gas in electric generating stations, which is by far the largest single customer for coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.661" offset="4221994">Now, if the Commission is precluded from giving weight to these factors, from measuring in the public interest in making a value judgment as to whether the use of natural gas as boiler fuel is required by public convenience and necessity taking all of these factors into account, then I say that the Third Circuit has vitiated the 1942 Amendment and has deprived the Federal Power Commission of one of its most important functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.564" offset="4353651">It would strip the Commission of any real expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.478" offset="4369324">As the -- as the Third Circuit ruled, the only thing the Commission could properly evaluate were the conventional factors, a market, a gas supply, rates, all technical factors which the Commission could merely list on a sheet of paper and check off and under the ruling of the Third Circuit, would be compelled to issue a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.452" offset="4457200">Now under Section 7 (c) of the Natural Gas Act, we say that the Commission's functions go beyond the conventional factors, these so-called, technical requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.438" offset="4509132">The Commission must give consideration to other aspects of the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.600" offset="4533791">And those aspects, Congress has said to the Commission, include conservation, impact on competing fuels, and other matters that are not so-called technical or checklist items of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.271" offset="4612472">Now, the respondent Transco, in its briefs, states that the Commission -- or that Third Circuit was right and that the Commission is not required to give effect to these policy considerations which the Commission did take into account, but on the other hand, it says, that the Commission should have taken into account the air pollution law and given policy effect to that or to the antitrust laws, which are filled very much whoever in the case, but they say, the Commission should have given them some effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.627" offset="4749876">Well if that isn't exceeding, the balance which the Third Circuit has set, that I don't know what is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.208" offset="4784253">Now much has been made of the fact that the Commission did not reach a rational judgment including that the public convenience and necessity had not been shown because of this so-called air pollution argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.919" offset="4847052">But we submit that the evidence of record is clear that the air pollution argument was greatly exaggerated, that the company had other means by which to solve its problem, one of which it's doing right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.999" offset="4899401">For years, ever since gas was made available to New York in 1951, it has had substantial volumes of natural gas, on a valley basis, available for use at waterside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.688" offset="4946108">And it did not make use of that gas until 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.776" offset="4966484">If my recollection is correct, it was in March of 1959, when Waterside first had natural gas for use in its boilers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.857" offset="5002846">Now, those volumes -- that company had volumes of gas available to it all those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.109" offset="5023848">We argued on the record that the problem is as bad as you say it is, why didn't you use the gas that was available to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.994" offset="5055300">And their answer was, "Well, physically, it couldn't be done but we didn't have a pipe down into the station."</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.797" offset="5074526">Well, they've got a pipe there now and they're using these substantial volumes of gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.154" offset="5119979">I don't know what the cost of the facility was, but if they're using valley gas, under the CD-3 rate, the average cost is less than the X-20 gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.568" offset="5177657">We submit that the policy considerations which the Commission took into effect were well within its legal competence to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.419" offset="5213080">We submit that the legislative history is clear, it couldn't be clearer than that the Commission does have authority to consider conservation in its administration of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.224" offset="5272221">We submit at this Court itself, in the Hope case and in the East Ohio case, found no problem in reaching that identical conclusion, that is that the 1942 Amendment, by broadening the Act, gave the Commission authority to deal with this most important problem in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.562" offset="5357589">We submit, therefore, Third Circuit's ruling is an error, that the Commission probably discharged its responsibilities under the Act, that the decision was within its legal of competence, and that its orders denying a certificate application to the pipeline company to transport its boiler fuel gas was correct and should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.831" offset="5474722">May it please the Court, I'd be very happy if I could meet the distinguished, Solicitor General to debate much of what he has said in the proper forum which would be the holds of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.509" offset="5541386">In our view, he has not answered the controlling issue, the issue which is disposed in this case at all, and that if that portion of his argument, which relates to end use or the reasonableness of the Commission in deciding a case on evidence, a no evidence report that on policy considerations outside the record, 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.561" offset="5681612">I -- those matters are not reached at all until the primary question is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.852" offset="5726751">Did the Congress rest in the Commission the power to regulate in this subject matter that it did here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.188" offset="5764159">That was the question that was decided by the Court of Appeals, that's the question we've raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.742" offset="5786311">We've stressed it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.388" offset="5792893">We've pointed out the decisions of this Court, Hope, Panhandle, Indiana and so forth on which this Court has passed on that question in a number of different forums, he has not replied in his brief or in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.752" offset="5850363">Now, let's get right down to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.770" offset="5866454">Con Edison had a serious air pollution problem in New York City, in the vicinity of the United Nations at its Waterside plant which was an old plant, built 57 years ago, when it was an area of slums and slaughter houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.564" offset="5945657">Now, it is the most congested area of the world with great tall buildings, as well as the United Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.277" offset="5980453">I've read this morning's papers, as to this being a makeweight argument where the commissioner of pollution, because of an inverted condition such as we're familiar with in Los Angeles, having occurred in New York, is asking industry to cut back on every possible use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.751" offset="6054327">Asking people not to use cars, not to burn leaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.782" offset="6074493">This was no makeweight argument but as was suggested by Mr. Justice Harlan, that question is not reached with the Commission lacked the power to make the decision it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.174" offset="6132067">Our basic objection with the Commission's decision is that if denied the transportation certificate to Transco for no reason whatsoever, related to the transportation function, but for the sole reason, as the Solicitor General has stated when he gave you the four purposes, for this primary purpose, that it disapproved of the public policy and wisdom of Con Edison's going to Texas, making a direct non-jurisdictional purchase of this gas and, may I say, that when Con Edison made that direct purchase in Texas, there was no power of the Commission over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.642" offset="6349928">If he could've used the gas in Texas, as approximately half of all the natural gas produced in this country is used in the state production, there would be no Federal Power Commission question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.141" offset="6411891">If Con Edison had built his own pipeline from Texas to New York, according to the decisions of this Commission, that Commission would have no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.065" offset="6463613">The Montana Power Company built a line into Wyoming and made a direct purchase of gas for boiler fuel in transport and it submitted the matter nine years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.055" offset="6507604">Think of the nine years in this argument that a great flood is going to be unloosed by this and the Commission held that it had no jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.530" offset="6565491">Into Wyoming, crossing state lines for its own use and consumption, not, of course, for resale, electric company alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.702" offset="6602167">And it submitted to the Commission and said, "Do we have -- do you have jurisdiction over this transaction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.016" offset="6627453">If so grant this certificate, we think not, if so deny it on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.943" offset="6651173">And the Commission denied it on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.910" offset="6667055">Now, here, a purchaser, a direct purchaser from the producer, may use his gas as he sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.725" offset="6714284">So that Edison was in the position, it had made a non-jurisdictional purchase, it could use the gas, and I disagree with the Solicitor General in his answer that if the gas were bottled and transported by a truck or a ship, that it would be the subject of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.218" offset="6796204">I call Your Honors' attention to the well-known fact that a large part of the household supply of gas in the United States is bottled gas that we have outside, and which has been clearly understood, not within the scope of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.285" offset="6868511">Now, after that was -- Edison was in the position that it bought its gas, it could use it, whether the air pollution of the United Nations is good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.961" offset="6919189">It could use it as it saw it fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.269" offset="6928488">It then went to Transco and it said, "Will you build, for our account, additional facilities and will you operate those facilities to bring our gas from Texas to New York City for our use?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.850" offset="7002781">And let me say that the examiner, the Commission itself, found that there was no disadvantageous effect in that transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.576" offset="7065684">It was found that all of the standards prescribed in Section 7 of the Act had been matched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.638" offset="7097971">It found that the standards, which since 1938, it had it evolved and applied in case after case for a transportation certificate, had been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.588" offset="7149693">That's what was called, the conventional ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.447" offset="7165158">It found that the charge which Transco made was compensatory to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.720" offset="7198281">It found there was no burden on any of the services rendered by Transco in making that transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.617" offset="8025840">And real question which the Solicitor General has failed to deal with in his briefs or argument is whether the undoubted power to certificate the transportation by Transco, can be used as a device to regulate and prohibit because that's what it is, to prohibit the Edison purchase which is a matter not within its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.228" offset="8152273">Now, I am being somewhat positive in my statement that the Commission and the Solicitor General, I believe, agrees with it, that the Commission made no of hypocritical claim that it was regulating -- denying this certificate for any transportation reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.216" offset="8280273">It found these benefits, these conventional standards had been met and in a recent case filed with the DC Circuit here, the Commission referring to X-20 decision, used these words that, “its action was an attempt to foil that transaction by denying the transportation certificate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.589" offset="8397720">And I could refer you to -- rather strange perhaps, but I suggest an uneasy conscience on the part of the Federal Power Commission but it's been prolific in case after case, which is decided subsequent with the X-20 to going back and trying to explain what it did decide in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.573" offset="8501687">And one that is very interesting, I now refer to it by means of pointing out something that I don't think the Solicitor General has been informed about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.229" offset="8556335">He said that these sales had been authorized and they have been last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.212" offset="8596250">The sales of natural gas in this nation were about 13 billion Mcf. of which 3 billion went to householders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.664" offset="8650062">The other 10 billion went to industry, commercial, well drilling, all kinds of uses of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.562" offset="8701576">In this Midwestern case, there is a dispute among the commissioners as there was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.493" offset="8729370">The -- the vote here was 3 for the opinion 1 for the result, but for not going long with the reasons, in the third trial dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.101" offset="8767822">In the Midwestern case, the evidence showed that the pipeline was proposing to sell gas to industry below its cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.705" offset="8822157">And certain of the commissioners, realizing that that would make the householder, the small user which is supposedly the cherished person, pay more than he should pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.069" offset="8879626">I objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.809" offset="8886627">Now, the majority in referring to X-20 decision, said that was -- their action was one of denying an application to permit the sale of natural gas for boiler fuel, not a word about transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.114" offset="8967816">In another one, the Trunk Line, the interesting question there was whether the price that Edison had negotiated could be used in the Trunk Line case as a good precedent, because of its arms-like nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.772" offset="9026435">The majority said, referring to X-20, "The sales failed by reason of our denial of a transportation certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.565" offset="9057677">The dissenting commissioner, Connole, a man of great ability said, "The certificate was denied in part, because the direct purchase of these volumes of gas would tend to raise the rates unduly."</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.157" offset="9119953">Now, I should correct myself, it was Mr. -- Commissioner Klein in the Midwestern case who was objecting to the sale of the industry below cost and the effect on the householder that he used the words I quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.477" offset="9193305">Now, I don't have the time and I don't suppose it's material to go into some of the basic facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.830" offset="9230712">Edison supplies 1,300,000 gas customers, mostly small ones of the nature of the Act is intended to protect 2,000,000 of electric customers and quite unusually, it supplies steam to about 2000 customers, but those customers or for example, Rockefeller Center, that vast complex of 15 large buildings, is one customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.996" offset="9355368">The heat largely from the steam manufactured at Waterside with the X-20 gas if that had been available, goes to that Rockefeller Center and those people in Rockefeller Center and other business offices and departments I suppose, are small people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.412" offset="9436975">But, I mentioned that because the notion that Edison was selfishly trying to get this gas and that that the charge that -- the air pollution was not a true consideration, it was a makeweight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.621" offset="9509804">Edison, from its own selfish economic interest, would not have an adverse effect on the gas it has to purchase from Transco and other pipelines for resale to the public, if it would have the effect that is suggested here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.035" offset="9911463">There was no evidence in the record offered on the subject, except by the officers of the City of New York and by Con Edison's offices.</text>

            <text syncTime="2501.717" offset="10110203">Dr. Greenburg is not the typical hired professional witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.770" offset="10138415">He came in not with pat-statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.657" offset="10150013">He came in with his heart in this thing and he talked with gravity, like a man making a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.655" offset="10181987">He said, "I can't prove that this pollution, which is occurring in New York is the cause of the lung cancer, but I think there is a great reason to suspect it."</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.954" offset="10231202">Now, the word suspect in there, the indefiniteness has been the subject of an attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.508" offset="10253354">Well naturally, he referred to, what was it, 4000 deaths that occurred a few years ago over in one week's time in London, because of air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.038" offset="10311555">Well there and again in the Donora, Pennsylvania, where I think there were 50 deaths, the mass autopsies was able to establish it to be sure that couldn't be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.058" offset="10359620">But what was established?</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.132" offset="10367875">That this Waterside plant, each and everyday, pours out into the atmosphere 27,000 pounds of fly ash and soot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.956" offset="10411238">And what the Solicitor General failed to mention, 42,000 pounds of toxic sulfur dioxide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.538" offset="10449481">They -- in the attack on the indefiniteness, there is a testimony by Dr. Greenburg of the collecting station that are all over New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.071" offset="10495666">And on the lured side, because you can't put the stations out in the East River, on the lured side, they make a great point as to wind direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.375" offset="10540910">It shows a pollution -- I mean, a deposit that is sought, which had been microscopically examined and connected with the soot coming out of these chimneys of Waterside, it -- of many times that occurring at any other place in the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.161" offset="10612067">Now, it seems to us that there are four decisions that bear on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.612" offset="10633801">Briefly, our point is that Section 1 (b) of the Act is the jurisdictional section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.918" offset="10671000">The other sections, I think, are fairly described as operational sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.675" offset="10694092">Once you have the jurisdiction established and one day grants jurisdiction over to transportation of natural gas or the sale for resale of natural gas or natural gas companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.390" offset="10776952">And then, as this Court had occasion to say in Panhandle, the Indiana Public Service Commission in 1947 that this legislation in 1 (b) is of unusual legislative precision, because then it goes on with a prohibition against regulation in any other field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.744" offset="10882382">And this Court said and I'd like to read these two short sentences, "The omission in Section 1 (b) of any reference to other sales, that is direct sales for consumptive use in the affirmative declaration of coverage, was not advertent, it was deliberate."</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.762" offset="10946435">Congress made sure its intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.396" offset="10956988">It could not be mistaken by adding the explicit provision that the Act shall not apply to any other sale, direct sales for consumptive use of whatever sort, were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.387" offset="11016965">I am reading from the decision in the Panhandle, the Indiana Public Service Commission, 332 U.S. 507.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.322" offset="11068688">I -- it's set forth in our brief at -- I think it's about page 40 -- no, it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.954" offset="11127202">It's – it's referred to at pages 18, 26 and 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.962" offset="11147264">I think the first time we had rather full quotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.442" offset="11165132">Then another case that we rely on, that Solicitor General has mentioned, is the Hope case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.671" offset="11198046">Hope was a rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.580" offset="11205674">It was under operative Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act relating to rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.214" offset="11240260">The State of West Virginia having large interest in natural gas, coal, and oil intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.624" offset="11269831">It sought to -- it objected to the rate schedule the Federal Power Commission had prescribed, and it objected because it wanted a high rate for industry in order to promote the conservation of its resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.389" offset="11348929">Now, the majority writing to Mr. Justice Douglas held specifically that the operative rate sections could not be perverted to invade a jurisdiction which Congress had withheld from the Federal Power Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2872.921" offset="11595107">That you'd have to -- that have to go to Congress to get the support for that, but then you did say whether it's dictum or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.890" offset="11626977">You did say that under the transportation or certificate Section 7, that conservation might be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.848" offset="11662712">Now, you referred to the 1942 Amendment and -- I see, I have five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.452" offset="11701164">I -- I think I'd better refer to that, that 1942 Amendment had three objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.383" offset="11732929">One was to give the Commission power to pass on the certification of all expansion of pipeline not just in the competitive areas it's had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.118" offset="11779845">Two, it was to give the Commission power to consider in granting the certificate, initial breaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.254" offset="11836374">In other words, your decision recently in CATCO, which we do not have any quarrel with, that's a sale for resale, where you have said that under those circumstances initial rates could be prescribed, is soundly founded on the legislative history of the 1942 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.727" offset="11918294">Now, the third thing was that the Commission might consider the interest of the producers or carriers of competing fuels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.978" offset="11979316">Now, in that sense, of course that was a conservation element and therefore, I think the -- if I read Mr. Justice Douglas' wording in Hope, in referring to that, that he was referring to that element of conservation, then I -- whether it's dictum or not, I think it's entirely correct, entirely supported by the history and I think that's the way it should be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.512" offset="12101465">Now, I -- time does not permit, there was another fourth case -- another Panhandle one in 1951, where the question is whether Michigan could regulate these direct sales and this Court upheld the power of Michigan and said that the Federal Power Commission had no such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.560" offset="12193625">And the last case, which is really very close in point and solves any question that may in the Hope case, again it was the Panhandle case in 337 U.S., where the certain gas leases had been included in the pipeline certificate as reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.950" offset="12271156">The Company then tried to sell the gas leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.790" offset="12282546">The Commission tried to block or foil that sale and this Court held, it had no such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.298" offset="12312534">And in that connection, this Court stated specifically that their certificate provision Section 7 could not be used as an indirect means to violate or invade an area which Section 1 (b) had prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="3694.975" offset="14883297">That's the 60-day gas which has been explained and re-explained here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.099" offset="14899806">And then, it was specifically found by the examiner, and this is important, that there will be no adverse effect on Transcontinental's other customers or Transcontinental's other regulated business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.444" offset="14973158">And then as it has been indicated here, while I feel that at the point I just suggested, the inquiry on this particular record was at an end and the Transco should have been granted its certificate, we went further in what might be surplusage and put on this very extensive testimony in which was done on the great benefits that would accrue to the City of New York by the suppression of air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.625" offset="15097919">Now the Commission acknowledge that we did all of these things, but they said, there are certain policy considerations, which militate against the grant of this certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.745" offset="15166360">Now let me give you a brief history as far as the record is concerned in respect to these policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.888" offset="15194885">During the course of this trial, before the examiner, there was only a single issue raised, which ultimately became one of the five policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.446" offset="15245145">And that issue was the displacement of coal or what is then loosely called, end use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.749" offset="15278373">Now we knew that that would be an issue because Mr. McGrath, representing the coal people had been permitted to intervene and that issue was cross-examined by Mr. McGrath extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.176" offset="15352038">The only evidence, as Mr. LeBoeuf has told you, that was put into this record, was put into the record by Transcontinental, Consolidated Edison and the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.384" offset="15400939">No other evidence was put into this record by anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.998" offset="15423404">At no time during the course of the trial of this proceeding, was any issue even suggested, vaguely intimated, or hinted, other than the so-called issue of displacement of coal or end use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.247" offset="15480351">None of these, all the four policy considerations that I will come to shortly, were tried on the record, suggested, or even remotely intimated in the course of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.481" offset="15533328">The record was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.130" offset="15539911">Some three weeks later, the Commission staff brief to the examiner was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.313" offset="15564675">And then for the first time, there was recited four or five -- five arguments against the grant of certificate, four of them were completely novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.571" offset="15625697">One of them, of course, was end use or boiler fuel use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.697" offset="15646177">And you will note in the Commission's opinion that after reciting what the staff and the coal people argued, they list them first, second, third, fourth, and boiler fuel use, the Commission devotes the next two pages to merely paraphrasing those contentions of counsel, which made up the brand new four policy considerations, adopts them as their own, and then they say, that taking these four policy considerations, in conjunction with end use, they served to tip the balance against the denial of the certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4030.769" offset="16226408">Now the first of these novel policy considerations was that if the Commission granted this request, they would be confronted with many requests of the same general character and granting the X-20 proposal, they would have no fear or rational basis for denying similar such requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.806" offset="16334555">Now, we assume that the Commission is talking about -- I will assume first, they're talking about a case very closely analogous to this, where large quantities of gas are being bought in the suppression of air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.913" offset="16399026">I submit in that connection, if Your Honor please, that, yes, there are other cities, probably the worst affected city, is the City of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.275" offset="16444479">I presume that it would be fair to say that New York is probably a very close second.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.002" offset="16479378">And we may have similar air pollution conditions in some of the other cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.162" offset="16500067">But I submit in that regard that if they were submitted to the Commission, applications for the use of gas for the suppression of an air pollution condition, such as exists in New York, then it would be arbitrary and capricious not to grant the use of gas for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.470" offset="16589302">On the other hand, if the Court -- if the Commission, for chances, enlarging its thinking to include the typical industrial customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.944" offset="16639143">And I'm sure that in the opposition briefs, when they speak of this great insatiable mark, it's going like a gigantic sponge down to soak up all the available gas in Texas so that not a single thousand cubic feet will be left for the resale market, they can only be talking about the broad general, what I call, typical industrial market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.631" offset="16741857">Now the typical industrial market buys gas for one purpose, not for the purpose of suppressing air pollution, but for the single purpose of saving dollars and cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.531" offset="16797445">Very frequently, these big industrial plants will have two or three valves, an oil valve, a coal valve, and a gas valve, and they will buy the fuel that is the cheapest and that's the sole criterion for the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.278" offset="16852511">Now, let's pause for a moment and see how colossal this market is or is going to be in the light of the constantly rising prices of gas in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.271" offset="16908413">In the very Midwestern case, talked about by Mr. LeBoeuf, Midwestern could only be certificated, because the competition from other fuels was so terrific.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.957" offset="16963166">It could only be certificated, providing it sold the gas that it purchased from its parent Tennessee at a lesser price than it actually paid to its parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.114" offset="17023875">And Commissioner Klein, in that case, dissented and took the position that he felt the end result there was one, where the domestic and the small commercial consumer was, in effect, subsidizing the industrial sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.876" offset="17098898">Well known to the Commission, here is Northern Natural Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.949" offset="17119169">Some two or three years ago, actually lost the sale of a boiler fuel load to the Council Bluffs Power Plant, right across the river, from its own offices for gas laid down in Council Bluffs, not purchased in Texas, but laid down in Council Bluffs at 22 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.955" offset="17215195">Now, to bring the picture closer to Hope as a demonstration of the lack of this insatiable typical industrial market, here's Transcontinental, it had one large industrial customer for boiler fuel, that was the Duke Power Company in the Carolinas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.550" offset="17289592">Ten years ago, we were authorized to sell them a substantial block of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.516" offset="17309445">They were interested in the gas because at that time it was cheaper than coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.616" offset="17325850">And then five years ago, that project was renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.939" offset="17339120">It's running out this December.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.687" offset="17350092">Duke Power no longer wants any gas from Transcontinental.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.158" offset="17372035">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.451" offset="17377155">The price is too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.326" offset="17384678">They can buy coal cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.862" offset="17398784">They're taking a little tiny amount of gas from us, for what they call fuel ignition purposes, but the blocks of boiler fuel gas are no longer wanted because of the competitive price of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.892" offset="17458970">And that situation is becoming more and more acute and more and more nationwide so this vast insatiable market spoken up in my friend's briefs, I think is in the land the imaginary.</text>

            <text syncTime="4457.092" offset="17931786">But the plain fact is that price pressure in the field is dependent upon the totality of the demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.050" offset="17963551">In other words, it, Transcontinental itself, had gone down and purchased this gas and then sold it to Consolidated Edison, the end result, as far as price pressure is concerned, would have been absolutely identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="4565.498" offset="18365315">That is precisely the point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.303" offset="18380570">And I think that the real basic thrust of the Commission's position, one of the veneers stripped from the other three or four denial factors, is that here, the Commission was very, very reluctant to see any sale made by a producer, which was not subject to the Commission's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.276" offset="18472521">That I think that the whole thrust of the opinion points very strongly in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.463" offset="18501256">I even would venture the notion that since they take the view that end use is not determinative, that had we gone -- we Transcontinental bought the gas and then resold it to Con Ed, we probably wouldn't be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.760" offset="18570428">Certificate – Commission might well have certificated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.620" offset="18581817">But it's been mentioned by Mr. LeBoeuf, this particular gas, Transcontinental didn't dare to buy, and why, because it would have triggered Transcontinental's favored nations contracts to the extent that our gas cost would have gone up -- the cost of our other gas would have gone up by $15,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.563" offset="18677635">And that's one basic reason why Transcontinental was virtually shut out of this field and shut out from making this purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.259" offset="18712430">Now, when the Commission talks about the effect that this purchase being to raise the price in the jurisdictional channel, shall I say, I think there's a pretty fair answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.620" offset="18765824">That Congress has given the Commission machinery to regulate those prices in the jurisdictional, purely jurisdictional channel, and irrespective of what the influences are that moved those prices up, the Commission has Section 4 of the Act, Section 5 of the Act, and Section 7, in respect to initial prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.695" offset="18858193">And they have adequate machinery of control for those prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.268" offset="18896436">I will get to cut some portions of my discussion of each of these policy considerations, because I'd like to spend a moment on the so-called 1942 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.891" offset="18954951">The impression is given throughout the briefs that the 1942 Amendment of the Gas Act, in some fashion, gave the Commission authority over the conservation of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.865" offset="19014823">As the lower court said that -- as they read this Commission's opinion, the Commission was attempting herein to exercise that general conservation authority over the totality of the gas research.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.444" offset="19069158">Now what briefly was the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.345" offset="19076786">In the original 1938 Act, the Commission had an extremely straitjacketed, geographical jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.874" offset="19106879">They could only certificate another -- a pipeline going into the territory or market already served.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.368" offset="19136867">And as Commissioner Manley (ph) points out in his testimony, there were tremendous number of difficulties involved with the administration of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.364" offset="19160795">One, the question, what was that market?</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.496" offset="19169364">Was it merely a market served that the actual towns it was served, was it a geographical area, what was it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.281" offset="19196531">He spells out in detail what difficulties we had trying to administer that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.172" offset="19216071">So that the basic fundamental broad purpose of the 1942 Amendment was to release that straitjacket and give the Commission authority nationwide, and that was its one and total purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.666" offset="19286079">And in the course of his testimony, it was indicated that because of the restricted nature of prior certificate authority, the coal people had not been granted full participation so that Commissioner Manley pointed out that a secondary effect of this Act would be to permit the coal people to be treated as interveners in Section 7 certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.325" offset="19744684">For what purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.026" offset="19411466">For the purpose of them showing the economic effect upon them and that is made specific in the Manley testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.199" offset="19456188">Now the implication is that there were recitals in the Hope case and a recital in the East Ohio case that seemed to make reference to the fact that the 1942 Amendment gave the Commission conservation powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.479" offset="19533302">I happen to have here a copy of the report and I would enjoy having my friends, I have two copies, pointing out anywhere in that report where there is any reference or suggestion of a conservation power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.404" offset="19592965">I don't happen to have Commissioner Manley's testimony here, but I have reviewed it and I think that by no stretch interference, can it possibly be said that there was a single word in that 1942 testimony of his in respected conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.880" offset="19654928">And there was a real reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.741" offset="19662346">When this matter was being drafted in Federal Power Commission, Commissioner Manley had one strong objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.524" offset="19689514">He wanted to get that legislation through rapidly, and in that interest, we brought into the meetings of the Federal Power Commission, the coal people, the railroad people, the representatives of the pipelines, and the NARUC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.050" offset="19747610">To get every last difficulty straightened out so that this amendment would move through the Commission rapidly or through the Congress rapidly and to have put in any suggestion that we were -- wanted a power over conservation, would have opened the Pandora's Box and that legislation might still be pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="4957.560" offset="19933602">But as you pointed out and I'm sure, it was your decision in the Edison case when you drew a distinction between the broad type of statute like the Interstate Commerce Act and the National racial -- relations -- Labor Relations Act and I think the Federal Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.652" offset="20009984">And you said when Congress wants to give broad sweeping powers, it uses broad vague language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.321" offset="20036629">And the broader the language and the vaguer, the more is the power to the administrative agency to fill in.</text>

            <text syncTime="4998.797" offset="20098591">And I think you must remember that -- and you particularly pointed out the denials of authority that were given to the Fair Labor Standards Administrator and indicated that those were restrictions on the concept of – or the breadth of the powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="5037.651" offset="20253968">And in respect to this notion of the Commission that they could give to the pipeline companies, the net result of the Commission's decision is that there is only one group of people that come down into the fields and buy gas, pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.843" offset="20326693">Distributing companies are out, whether they're buying it for direct sales such as this one or whether they're buying it for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.878" offset="20354905">The import of the Commission's decision is that they don't want them down there because they raise prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.175" offset="20376116">I say that they're answered thrust implications or at least the spirit of the antitrust acts are being violated when the Commission restricted them to a limited group of pipelines, when as a matter of fact, the Federal Trade Commission in its report, which is also recited, have that as one of the reasons why they put Section 20 in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.492" offset="20449364">So I think that each section of the Act must be read as a limitation on the concept of public convenience and necessity as it's contained in the given statute and here particularly you have 1 (b) which says that they cannot regulate a direct sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.143" offset="20523969">I think that's definitely to be read into the concept of public convenience and necessity.</text>
