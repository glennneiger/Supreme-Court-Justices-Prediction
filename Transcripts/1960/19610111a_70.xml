            <label>Mr. Robert Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="20.277" offset="184508">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.715" offset="190255">I should like to speak just a few moments about the final point which is raised by petitioner in 179.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.659" offset="222020">That point briefly is that because the alleged error in the judge's charge to the jury, the 25-year sentence under the third column for the aggravated form bank robbery is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.859" offset="278758">It seems to us, the Government, that this motion in this respect similarly to the motion raised under Number 70 gives rise to a rather serious question about the orderly proper administration of the rules of criminal law in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.251" offset="364335">That is for this reason as you will note in the record on pages 18 to 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.916" offset="391084">At the trial, petitioners, able counsel took various exceptions to the judge's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.432" offset="421073">None of the exceptions in anyway however, raised the particular alleged error that is now being asserted for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.522" offset="457435">In addition, prior to this motion in Number 179, petitioner has filed three other post-conviction motions, one in 1956, one in 1958, and the one in Number 70, the companion case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.504" offset="533400">And none of those three motions was this particular point raised or with any reference in any way made to an alleged error of any kind in the judge's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.911" offset="579062">Now this, of course, is not a proceeding here by direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.965" offset="595257">So what it means is that for the first time here, more than seven years after the verdict and the sentence, the petitioner is attempting to assert an alleged error in the trial judge's charge to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.298" offset="664534">Now, as we understand the petitioner's argument, it runs somewhat along this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.849" offset="686791">This motion is under Rule 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.866" offset="698807">Rule 35, of course, expressly says that it is to be used only to correct in a legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.681" offset="726079">Petitioner says therefore, “We do not attack the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.484" offset="749275">That is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.337" offset="756694">We attack only the 25-year sentence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="166.567" offset="769651">What is wrong with the 25-year sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="169.738" offset="782294">Well, it is void because of the alleged error in the judge's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.581" offset="805700">But what was the effect of the alleged error in the judge's charge?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.835" offset="822732">Well, it voided the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.075" offset="843630">Well, it seems to us in effect that it's almost impossible to assert the alleged error in the charge without also in effect attacking the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.054" offset="891591">We just -- and that incidentally was the point that troubled the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.471" offset="1149262">But if you simply look -- if we don't look at the judge's charge, the verdict is good and the sentence is good.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="374.150" offset="1599927">Well, as far as I know, there is no decision of this Court or of any lower court that has ever gone so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.486" offset="1633364">All the cases cited, for instance, in the petitioner's brief on pages 34 and 35, are just truly distinguishable for -- for example, the Ladner case did not arise under Rule 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.790" offset="1682578">That arose under Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.663" offset="1694072">The same is true with the Shelton case, the Askins case and the Morgan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.631" offset="1713925">The only case cited in petitioner's brief which actually arose under 35 was the Hoffman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.580" offset="1737644">And the error in the Hoffman case appeared clearly simply from the indictment and the judgment of the conviction of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.376" offset="1768887">There is no question of the charge there, none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.200" offset="1792188">Now, of course, we -- the petitioner makes the point that even if release should not be granted under Rule 35 that this Court should consider the case under 28 U.S.C. 2255 as an alternative avenue of approach so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.851" offset="1866794">But it seems to us again that petitioner is in reality no better off even if this Court should wish to do that, because again, we do not think that this is the type of relief that should be given by way of a collateral attack under Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.453" offset="1953207">And again, none of the cases cited by petitioners actually so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.911" offset="1979016">One of the main cases cited by petitioner is the Ladner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.814" offset="1994585">But as the petitioner pointed out yesterday in argument, this Court expressly did not pass on this point in the Ladner case, on the ground that the Government had not raised it in a timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.261" offset="2048397">Whether there's no question what the governor is -- Government has raised the point in Number 179 here before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.191" offset="2084133">The record shows at page two here that the District Judge expressly ruled against petitioner on this very ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.538" offset="2121540">So the Ladner case is simply not in point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.479" offset="2137318">The other cases cited by petitioner also are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.402" offset="2156962">The Askins case for example involved an indictment which showed on its face that it was outlawed by the statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.813" offset="2194578">The Morgan case involved denial of a constitutional right, the right to counsel which is very different than the right to servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.289" offset="2232508">None of the cases actually that we know of have gone so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.141" offset="2251943">In fact, we cite in our brief half a dozen decisions of Court of Appeals which are merely represented where one Court of Appeal after another has denied any relief by way of collateral attack for an alleged misdirection by a judge to adjourn.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.092" offset="2331773">The Adams case in page 44 of our brief that alleged error was about intoxication and burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.161" offset="2364061">Relief denied because it was by way of collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.372" offset="2380884">The Banks case alleged error and he charged the jury about entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.081" offset="2399692">The (Inaudible) case alleged errors in the charge about burden of proof reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.598" offset="2425814">The Lopez case alleged error in the charge about conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.240" offset="2448384">The Stevens case at page 44 of our brief, very similar to ours and that the alleged error there related to the definition of jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.888" offset="2486941">In all of those cases, the appellate courts without any dissent refused to give the type of relief that is sought here for alleged misdirection in an attack as brought here collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.554" offset="2545560">And it seems to us it raises a very basic question whether this type of error can be asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.213" offset="2580250">Many, many years after the judgment of conviction, after the time of appeal has expired by way of an indirect attack so to speak under either Rule 35 or 28 U.S.C. 2255.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Vorenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="685.230" offset="2844296">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.759" offset="2854431">There is one small factual issue which I think should be laid completely to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.354" offset="2880763">In counsel for the Government's statement of the case, he left it somewhat uncertain as to whether in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.770" offset="2918484">The petitioner had in fact been asked whether he had anything to say on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.475" offset="2945233">He went on to say that he assumed that the question had been directed to counsel rather than the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.403" offset="2973027">I would like to read from the Government's brief in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.946" offset="2991208">It is -- this is page nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.857" offset="2998836">It's clear from an examination of the record on this case that there is no indication of the Court at the time of sentencing as to this appellant if he desired to make a statement in person.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.332" offset="3044707">I just -- I -- I don't think that is an issue where we -- this case has been argued on the assumption that the question was not directed to the petitioner but I thought that should be like clearly to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.101" offset="3091728">The only other point that I would like to raise in the very brief time I have left, relates to this problem of perspective application that has been introduced in the argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.085" offset="3151705">In the brief of the Government and the Court of Appeals and in its brief here and it has proceeded solely on the basis on the allocution point that the -- on the merits, our interpretation of the right given by Rule 32 (a) is wrong that it's not a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.151" offset="3239999">It need not be a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.804" offset="3250552">Of course, I now understand the Government's position, it is perversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.071" offset="3271659">It is prepared to conceive that henceforth, it would be willing to see the rule interpreted as giving a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.155" offset="3308022">And that it's -- the only issue is -- whether this should be applied retroactively or prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.237" offset="3356296">I believe it is fair in considering this question to put to one side the Rule 35 question.At least, I feel I've said about all I can say on that in my argument yesterday and in the brief that the -- this type of attack on a sentence is the classic attack on the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.291" offset="3444485">And I don't think I can add to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.961" offset="3459218">And I think in Mr. Kramer's statement just now, he conceded that the -- that the suggestion of Rule 35 isn't applicable, relate solely to the administrative problem, the burden on the Court on -- on the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.660" offset="3530062">I just suggest that this argument on the practical burden on the courts deserves the suppose attention of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.003" offset="3567365">It seems to me it's highly speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.754" offset="3578337">In the first place, it's a matter of guest as to how many judges have failed to ask this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.233" offset="3608325">In 15 years under the rule, there have only been a dozen cases that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.038" offset="3627551">Judge Biggs in the testimony I referred to yesterday said that it is customary for the question to be asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.345" offset="3652733">If there are a large number of cases that is still questionable, how many of them will come back before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.672" offset="3694111">But assuming that a substantial number of prisoners will exercise this right, the burden on the -- on the judicial system, it seems to me is of a very minor nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.294" offset="3744580">You're talking about a brief appearance before the sentencing judge in which the petitioner -- the accused would be asked question granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.390" offset="3792959">There maybe some transportation expense getting him to and from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.664" offset="3806020">But to me, the real scope of the burden goes no further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.059" offset="3823574">And finally, it's a temporary burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.267" offset="3832456">It's -- it's something that would be over in a relatively short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.109" offset="3867773">I don't think if -- if we consider only the practical side of it, I don't think it's one sided by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.809" offset="3894627">Because I think there's a -- a very strong practical argument against perspective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.126" offset="3919914">I think that it -- if you're considering the administration of justice to have a large number of prisoners serving the rest of their terms and the knowledge that they are denied this right which the Supreme Court now says it's a right that they always had under Rule 32 (a) but they just didn't get in the right time period in effect that they lost their rights under a fluke.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.228" offset="4024299">I just suggest that is another fair consideration for this Court if it's balancing practicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.795" offset="4054601">My final point is that I think that the suggestion that this Court prospectively applied an interpretation of a rule in the criminal case is without precedent and it's unsound as a matter of judicial administration.</text>
