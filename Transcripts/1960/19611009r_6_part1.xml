            <text syncTime="364.830" offset="1563752">The way in which these voting rights of the plaintiffs have been effectively denied, so effectively we say as to be effectively destroyed is by a so-called reapportionment statute adopted in 1901.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.394" offset="1642015">Now, the ultimate thrust of that statute today is that one-third of the qualified voters living in the rural areas of the State of Tennessee elect two thirds of the State Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.432" offset="1706172">Now, that 1901 statute not only violates this requirement of equality in voting, which I had just referred to the Tennessee Constitution, not only violates the requirement of equality in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.920" offset="1780046">But it plies directly in the teeth of and openly and flagrantly violates another provision of the Tennessee Constitution which is designed to by periodic 10-year reapportionment of the state legislature to guarantee this equality of which the Tennessee Constitution speaks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.321" offset="14157699">It seems to me, the meaning of the dismissal for one of jurisdiction is fine I take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.233" offset="14185284">There's some dispute about the meaning of the dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.959" offset="14216213">I emphasized the latter words because it seems to me that that was the meaning that the District Court attached to the order rather than the notion that there wasn't a substantive claim stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.228" offset="14273264">Because if you read as Mr. Rhyne pointed out the Court's opinion, it refers to the claim of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, to the claim of rights under the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.134" offset="14320912">And then in the next sentence it says, "We agree that there has been both the violation of the state constitution and the plaintiffs' rights", which I take it referrs back to the first seven.</text>

            <text syncTime="4070.635" offset="16386988">And I take that the complainants would have no objection to a decision on it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.298" offset="16409558">If there is any doubt about it, we think it is clear that at least a colorable case is stated and that this Court would be well advised to remand the case so the District Court might give it the benefit of a full opinion investigation of the question which might be on the facts and not just on the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.535" offset="16486567">That last question is involved in the question of jurisdiction, I think, to this extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.234" offset="16525333">The justiciability of the case depends in part upon whether the merits of the constitutional claim that is made are need for or amenable to judicial consideration, upon whether the interest that deserve constitutional protection here are sufficiently identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.912" offset="16620001">The fact is that -- would have to be taken into account are sufficiently articulateable so that the case can be adjudicated and so you can take a hold of it and reach a conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4147.171" offset="16693039">But since it does bear upon the justiciability of the cause, I'm going to direct my attention to it first and then go on in sequence to the other aspects of the question of jurisdiction and finally to deal with the argument concerning equitable discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.298" offset="16765555">The right to be free from hostile or capricious discrimination in the definition of the person invited -- entitled to vote or the exercise of the franchise is a federal right protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.804" offset="16827622">Although the clearest examples involved racial discrimination, the Fourteenth Amendment ex -- extends this course, prohibits of course arbitrary and capricious actions against other classes of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="5845.939" offset="23488115">And I am arguing that a remedy which the Tennessee court withheld should be granted in the lower court if upon further examination of this case, it appears both that relief is necessary because the state refused to act when its federal constitutional duty was pointed out and if it appears that a suitable remedy can be framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5876.338" offset="23609741">I do want to make just one or two further remarks about the nature of the substantive right that we're relying on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5886.209" offset="23649238">And of necessity, they will have to be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.620" offset="23666897">I want to emphasize that ours is not a purely mathematical argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.392" offset="23693960">We recognized that although one should start with equality of voting weight under our tradition that that's not the end of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.994" offset="23736383">And in our brief, we indicated through a study of the state constitution of what other opposing desiderata have been taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.154" offset="23777029">As a matter of fact, they're not very numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.683" offset="23787165">And no doubt there could be more.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.085" offset="23796778">And now we fully recognize that weighing and balancing such considerations is the function of the state legislature and that the arts of accommodation compromise the political maneuvers that frequently creep in are all within the political power of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5946.622" offset="23890923">But we say that the fact that the state has very wide discretion in the exercise of that political power and of the fact that the Court recognizes its broad political power does not require exulting that aspect of the state's power into an absolute to quote Gomillion and Lightfoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.974" offset="23972321">Indeed, it seems to us that in principle the case of Gomillion and Lightfoot is very similar to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.416" offset="24002100">I did not see why a case should be more justiciable because it arose under the Fifteenth Amendment rather than the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.915" offset="24032089">And it does not seem to me that the -- that the principle should be limited to racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5988.404" offset="24058002">There are other forms of discrimination that maybe equally invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.721" offset="24079318">I want to say one -- one word, if I may Mr. Justice, in the case of this importance on the point of judicial philosophy that Justice Frankfurter mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6005.721" offset="24127279">This is obviously a very important case one which will affect our representative institution for a long time so far as anyone could judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.595" offset="24170747">The issue is not confined to Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6019.192" offset="24181196">It affects number of states all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.874" offset="24199899">Plainly, it's also a very important question for this Court in terms of this Court's place in our tripartite governmental system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.051" offset="24244621">Probably, the most difficult questions are those that involve a determination of the proper limits of the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="6043.064" offset="24276699">We fully recognized that there wrongs which can be righted only by the people or by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="6051.971" offset="24312330">This Court doesn't carry the whole burden of Government and for it to rush in to try and deal -- right political wrongs instead of leaving them to the other branches, the political branches of the Government could impair its usefulness and it's usefulness in our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.488" offset="24394355">But I suggest to you that judicial inaction through excessive caution or through a fancied impotence in the face of crying necessity and very serious wrong may also do damage to our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.051" offset="24456631">They also do them indeed greater damage including the judicial prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.278" offset="24477529">The question it seems to me, was very well put by Professor Freud in another connection where he said the question is not whether the courts -- court can do everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.330" offset="24521728">The question is whether the Court can do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.834" offset="24535730">And he went on to point out that education and self-improvement maybe fostered by judicious views of judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.972" offset="24580242">And the force of a court decision, I would emphasize, is not confined simply by the scope of its decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.916" offset="24616082">It has a vast influence upon the state court and upon their ability and willingness to deal with this question under the state constitution which is where very much of it should be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.651" offset="24666969">Furthermore, the course of the decision extends because of the moral power of this Court influence, a great deal farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.107" offset="24700824">Justice Jackson just before he went out on the Court wrote, “A court which is governed by a sense of self-restraint does not thereby become parallels.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.400" offset="24738022">It simply conserves its strength to strike more telling blows in the course of working democracy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.825" offset="24767697">I suggest this is the occasion for such a blow.</text>

            <text syncTime="6180.273" offset="24825480">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6184.540" offset="24842512">I am told that a few months ago at the theological school of one of the great universities in the East, a most interesting discussion was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="6196.128" offset="24888905">The discussion of Senator (Inaudible), the parable of the Good Samaritan and as we lawyers would say that was a particular feast of that parable under discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6211.362" offset="24949823">The story is that the particular point was why did the Levite and the priest both passed by that certain man who had fallen among thieves?</text>
            <text syncTime="6225.915" offset="25008024">A theologian of national eminence leading the discussion and evidently he was the man of the world as well as a man of the church and he gave this response.</text>
            <text syncTime="6238.823" offset="25059641">He says, “I think the trouble was this, both the priest and the Levite were en route to a conference to discuss the question who is a Good Samaritan?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.852" offset="25107811">I suggest, may it please the Court that did -- that in this most important case that the Solicitor General and the appellants are perhaps en route to a conference to discuss constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.280" offset="25169565">I suggest that up to this point, they have not discussed nor touched upon some of the great principles with -- with which this Court has been concerned throughout its entire history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6280.670" offset="25227034">Now, reference has been made here as to whether this case is justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.602" offset="25258799">Actually, what we are talking about when we come to that phase of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.740" offset="25379380">Isn't it this?</text>
            <text syncTime="6296.043" offset="25288579">Is this a case of controversies under the Constitution of the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="6302.574" offset="25314701">If it isn't then this Court is not concerned with it in any particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.200" offset="25341241">Now what -- what is a case of controversy?</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.407" offset="25358064">Well, what -- why do we have that provision in the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="6322.096" offset="25392755">Were not -- were not our colonial judges concerning themselves with a great deal of matters and subjects that were not judicial in nature?</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.253" offset="25445418">As the priest is used in the market place today, was they not politicking?</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.752" offset="25475406">Or when they found this team to write the Constitution of the United States, they said that the judiciary would be concerned with cases and controversies unlike some of the subjects, the colonial judges were concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.521" offset="25546459">I wish to call this Court's attention to the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6368.337" offset="25577702">And I think you test the complaint not alone by their votes but by the type of relief that is asked.</text>
