            <label>Mr. Noel W. Deering</label>
            <text syncTime="24.706" offset="202167">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.226" offset="208227">This was the case which rose under the Federal Employers' Liability Act and the facts are somewhat unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.367" offset="248874">The plaintiff below, the respondent in this Court, was a dining car waitress who was employed by the defendant, petitioner in this case, as -- on the -- on a dining car on the train which was en route from Boston to New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.849" offset="334764">And on the 11th day of October 1954, she sustained an injury when the train came to a sudden stop at the station of Providence, Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.922" offset="383039">The circumstances of the stop with this; there was a lady by the name of Montell who had been on the station platform as the train was approaching the Baker Station stop at Providence and for some reason, apparently to commit suicide as all of the facts indicate and I think the respondent concedes, she stepped out in front of the train and the engineer in an effort to avoid running over her, an effort which is unsuccessful, brought the train to a sudden stop and this hostess in the dining car was thrown about, she was in the rear car of the train, an eight-car train, and received some injuries as a result of the sudden stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.321" offset="608632">Now, the platform at the Providence Station is between two tracks of this particular platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.849" offset="646771">The train was coming in on the left hand side.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.298" offset="660564">The platform is somewhat on a curve, beginning at the east end of the station and the train comes around the -- from Boston into the Providence Station on this curve, part of the platform but not all of that is covered by (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="159.420" offset="741021">There were some baggage trucks on the station platform at the time the accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.310" offset="768606">The respondent attaches great deal of significance to the presence of the baggage trucks there as having some causal connection to the injury, although I think he doesn't claim that there was any negligence in having in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.774" offset="822418">It was the merely part in preventing the engineer from seeing the woman on the track as soon as it was claimed he might have seen her.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.969" offset="863274">The evidence indicates that as this engineer was coming along the track, he had reached the point he was going at a speed of some 13 to 15 miles an hour having slowed down to make the normal station stop which would have been some few 100 feet beyond the point where the accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.196" offset="960136">And at that speed, he testified that his train would have come through a -- an ordinary stop without any ajar as such as occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.661" offset="1009977">His testimony was that when he was within about 40 feet of where the woman stepped off, he saw her stepping over the first rail of the rail nearest to the platform.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.692" offset="1202134">Actually, the stop which he made was within about 80 feet in emergency and his testimony and the testimony of several witnesses who were on the platform indicated that when the woman stepped off in front of the train, he was about a 100 -- he was about 40 feet although the respondent here argues that by certain testimony that the engineer gave in regard to the Providence baggage trucks on the platform, he must have been considerably farther away than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.464" offset="2553187">And still it would have caused the physical injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.707" offset="2562173">That, however, was not the argument advanced by the plaintiff before the Court of Appeals and that it is not the argument advanced for the plaintiff here and that is the reason why I'm dealing with it in that situation, but I would like the deal with both situations before I finish.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.619" offset="2625808">But as I say, the theory advanced consistently by the plaintiff was that the engineer could have stopped without an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.992" offset="2655378">The theory advanced by the Court of Appeals were adopted by the Court of Appeals whether that it couldn't have been brought to an emergency stop but if the emergency stop could have been attempted sooner, there would have been apparently no evidence or even a scintilla of evidence in the case and the evidence was the Court of Appeals refers to as the momentary hesitation on the part of the engineer, which would have not brought the train to anything other than an emergency stop at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.020" offset="2791424">Well now, getting on the -- at the end of the case before Judge Wyzanski in the District Court, a motion for directed verdict was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.060" offset="2851610">And Judge Wyzanski denied the motion at that time and then further motion was filed, the judgment notwithstanding with a verdict and for a new trial combined in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.172" offset="2916080">And at the time the motion was allowed -- dealt with, Judge Wyzanski said that he had no authority even though he felt there was no negligence in the case to directed verdict for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.988" offset="2987342">And he made some rather specific comments which appear at pages 133 and 134 of the record and page 6 and 7 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.385" offset="3040946">And on that, on the second motion, motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of motion for new trial, he said, I have endorsed as follows, "This motion would be granted by this Court if it were free to do so, but this Court construes the opinions and judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States as giving him no option but to deny the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.013" offset="3151391">" And then he went on and made further comments as to his reasons for denying the motions, expanding somewhat the formal endorsement on the motion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.935" offset="3211160">Now, the Court of Appeals in an attempt to (Inaudible) amplify the reason given by Judge Wyzanski for denying the motion gave an opinion on the merits of the case, but it did not reach the question of a motion for a new trial which was filed as I say in the alternative relief motion notwithstanding verdict because they said, "An appeal had not been taken from that order denying the motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.803" offset="3366536">" In other words, an appeal was taken merely from the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.966" offset="3387225">And they never reached the question of whether or not the judge, trial judge had discretion to deal with the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.089" offset="3443754">But in dealing with the question on the merits, the Court as I have indicated adopted a view different from that argued by the plaintiff below as to the theory of the happening of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.214" offset="3516270">The Court adopted the theory that on the engineer's testimony, there was a scintilla of evidence of negligence towards the woman on the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.436" offset="3561096">The Court didn't actually discuss negligence towards the hostess in the dining car who was injured, but the Court said the jury might have found a scintilla of evidence towards to the woman on the track in that, the engineer might have applied his brakes immediately upon seeing him when he was 40 feet away instead of that momentary hesitation that he made of seeing her go across and then waiting, saw her turn around and he was definitely convinced at that point that she wasn't going to step back and then he put his brakes in emergency, I submit with the same result that he would have had -- he had put them on at 40 feet rather than a shorter distance as the Court indicates that might have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.405" offset="3764955">Now, the Court, as I say, suggests that as the scintilla of evidence and the Court said, and we submit that the Court has misapplied the rules adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.080" offset="3823679">The Court said in reaching its conclusion that the plaintiff no longer has the burden of persuasion and actions of negligence under the Federal Act of Leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.263" offset="3868400">That only that barest possibility of causation is enough to make out a case for the jury, that only the mere scintilla of evidence to suggest the inference of any possible connection between the engineer's possibly negligent, failure to apply the brakes sooner had arraigned down in suicide was enough to take the case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.516" offset="3953455">Now, I submit that the Court has misinterpreted the opinions of this Court even though the Court there felt that it was following the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.240" offset="4012283">And I believe that the rule of the Court now or this Court now is act laid down in the Rogers Case, Rogers against Missouri Pacific 352 United States and in that case, the Court laid down the rule which perhaps I don't need to reiterate but that was the -- the test is whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part even the slightest to produce the injury or death for which the damages are sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.824" offset="4162644">Now, the proofs must justify, as I submit with reason and with reason, I submit leave some latitude to the judge in the District Court, the trial judge to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to submit to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.473" offset="4249266">Now, Judge Wyzanski clearly indicated that in his opinion, there was no evidence to submit to the jury, no evidence of negligence, but felt that he was bound to submit it to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.105" offset="4299839">And the Circuit Court upheld that opinion although it's interesting that the Circuit Court did point out that in its opinion, the trial judge still does have a function of exercising through judicial dis -- discretion or judicial appraisal rather of the facts in the case to determine whether or not has a question of law an issue of negligence is made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.244" offset="4416345">But then on the grounds given in this case which they gave indicate that it is pretty difficult, if not impossible to understand that that Court says for any judge in the court below to give any judicial appraisal of -- of the sufficiency of evidence to where the finding of negligence if the test which they give is carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.113" offset="4527835">Now, I submit that the Court, of course, wrote its opinion before this Court decided the case Inman against the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in which I feel that the Court applied the doctrine of the Rogers Case and the Inman Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.773" offset="4614457">And that this Court held that in that particular case which came up from Ohio that the Court in Ohio was correct in resting a verdict for the defendant in the case -- in that Court because there was not sufficient evidence to prove that there was negligence on the part of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.766" offset="4726471">So I -- I submit that the Inman case definitely negatives the holding of the Court of Appeals from the First Circuit that there was no further any burden on the plaintiff to prove negligence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.515" offset="4797419">Moreover, I think it definitely showed that something more than the mere' scintilla of evidence in the case that must be shown in order to make out a case from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.702" offset="4854157">The Court say they'll take the position that a scintilla of evidence and a scintilla of proof, the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.045" offset="4923538">Now, the -- I -- I think there's a distinct difference between the -- a scintilla of evidence even if the Court impose so far as to say that is enough to go to the jury and a scintilla of evidence that will make out a case for the jury, I don't think has ever been by adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.034" offset="5031476">I think that the Court clearly dealt with a situation almost identical to this in the case of Herdman against the Pennsylvania Railroad, 332 Massachusetts 518.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.913" offset="5091035">And the Court recalled that that was a case where a sudden stop was made and an engineer said that he stopped to avoid a train at a railroad cross -- automobile at the railroad crossing and that the conductor who was in the rear tire was so much shaken up by the sudden stop of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.201" offset="5184136">And although the plaintiff in that case relied upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, I submit that that is not a significant differ -- difference between that case and this case because even if the method of proof is different from that case and this case, the facts in both cases had clearly indicated the circumstances of the stop in both cases fully appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.571" offset="5301687">And the burden which the plaintiff had sustained was a proof of negligence and the Court held in the Herdman case that the proof had not been sustained and I submit --</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.880" offset="5518921">Now, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has suggested, there is an interesting procedural question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.731" offset="5550268">The Court of Appeals, although the question was before it and was fully briefed and argued merely ended up by saying that the question was not before it and it did not have to consider it, because no appeal had been taken from the order on the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.453" offset="5645145">Now, the respondent here says that no motion -- there's nothing through the motion for a new trial anyway, because it was waived at the time of trial and of course, that isn't so and I don't think I'll even spend a great deal of time arguing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.772" offset="5706480">Judge Wyzanski indicated almost at the outset of the hearing that he had made up his mind of what he was going to do in the case and I reached a certain point in the argument and he had said, "I'm not going to help you any here but I may help you later on,” or words to that effect and I said, "Well, apparently in view of that, there is no use for me to continue this argument any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.106" offset="5803760">" Now, Mr. Kelleher, in his brief said that amounts to waiver but I submit that nothing was further from my intention, I think the judge didn't consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.381" offset="5848900">I'm sure the judge didn't consider it as any kind of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.209" offset="5864260">And further, it has been suggested in the other brief that some exception or objection of -- should've been taken at that time and that that had -- not having been done there was a further waiver, but getting away from the technical points that have been raised in that connection, I will try to argue the question on the merits as to the necessity or lack of necessity or taking a second appeal, an appeal from an order on a motion for a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.249" offset="6296325">Now, the Court of Appeals apparently relying upon some of the cases in the First Circuit, which I have pointed out in my brief, indicated that there was a necessity for taking an appeal from the second -- from the order on the motion for new trial or the denial of the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.851" offset="6394755">And it's interesting to know that in certain hardship cases in the First Circuit and I think there maybe some another circuits where the time of appeal has expired on the motion for judgment that the motion -- on the -- on the judgment itself that the Courts have permitted but have not required up to this point, an appeal from the order on the post judgment motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.635" offset="6513873">Now, the cases which I cite here, I think indicate that most of the cases, I have pointed them out on page 24, there are several cases from the -- had a -- and where I see it appears that an order to permit appeal in certain cases where the appellant had lost the rights from appeal from the judgment, citing Avalon against Zismann or had mistaken his remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.379" offset="8724877">She was in that -- on the platform, apparently, one of the persons waiting for this train, which was to make a stop on its way to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.061" offset="8767613">Her position on this plan is placed pretty exactly and there's no dispute about this evidence, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.211" offset="8808260">There is a witness named Brewster who said that he came up this stairway here and walked eastward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.582" offset="8837726">He was waiting for this train also, he walked eastward to the fifth post, one, two, three, four, five and he stood there waiting for the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.019" offset="8887463">And as he stood there, Mrs. Montell, who was later killed, approached and asked him something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.903" offset="8914944">There was a short conversation and she then moved 20 feet to the east, which on this plan because it is twice the size, twice the scale of the -- twice the size of the exhibit, 20 feet on this plan is 2 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.769" offset="8982444">So Brewster was here and Mrs. Montell talked with him here at the fifth post and she then moved about to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.044" offset="9035525">There's no substantial dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.479" offset="9041272">I don't believe there's any dispute about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.499" offset="9057364">Now, the engineer says, and he was the first witness and the principal witness on liability, the engineer in a statement made prior to the trial, we saw on deposition or on discovery, motion for discovery, the engineer said that he saw this woman first when she was 40 feet away from him, she stepped into the tracks and in that pretrial statement made with the railroad people, was asked a specific question, "Did you see her step from the platform?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.364" offset="9220786">And he said, "No, I did not."</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.313" offset="9236668">He was asked whether there was any -- were any obstacles in his way and he said he didn't recollect that there were any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.178" offset="9260074">This is in the pretrial statements at the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.670" offset="9278046">It was because of that curious statement of his that he didn't see this woman although she was only 40 feet away, but he didn't see her step from the platform onto the track that this case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.698" offset="9338128">And when he appeared on the stand at the witness, it developed that there was an obstacle which prevented him from seeing her step from the platform and the obstacle was a baggage truck or trucks on the platform and he places that obstacle on the platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.432" offset="9437080">He says it was at the east end of the platform before you get to the canopy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.076" offset="9467695">Looking at another exhibit which is a photograph facing east or the right of the plan, he said, "They were just beyond the crossing."</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.330" offset="9524642">So we feel fully justified in placing them in the most favorable position for the railroad which is where I have put the red letter B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.231" offset="9584306">We think the evidence was warrant placing them farther to the east and even beyond the end of the canopy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.875" offset="9618892">But we are placing them here, which is the most favorable position for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.167" offset="9648044">Now, if the baggage trucks were there and Mrs. Montell was here --</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.624" offset="11289893">By the time he becomes abreast of those baggage trucks, his view can no longer be blocked, but, he has a straight view along the track of this woman who by that time has taken a couple of steps since in the middle of the track where he first saw her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.736" offset="11362304">Now, it's a matter of simple measurement on the scaled plan to determine that the distance from Montell to the baggage trucks is a 180 feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.462" offset="11561253">At any rate, I now suggest to the Court that the jury was abundantly warranted in finding that this engineer could and should have seen her when he is 180 feet away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.344" offset="11620707">He's going about 20 feet a second.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.119" offset="11635858">He could and should've seen her for nine second seconds before he hit her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.800" offset="11654562">The testimony and its undisputed again is that he did nothing -- it did if the nine second inference is correct, he did nothing for eight seconds with a helpless woman on the track, a woman who the railroad says is an obvious suicide or at best, the woman who isn't where she belongs, who was on a track going toward a fence, in which there is no opening to the engineer's knowledge, and so testified to this, his is familiar with the station, no opening in the tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.238" offset="11808371">Now, I should like to go into detail for just a moment about the second or so and what happened during that period, the second or so during which the engineer passed from this point to this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.981" offset="12415248">It's given on pages 16 and 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.433" offset="12433115">He was asked, "Did you see her before she got to the first rail?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.588" offset="12469687">And his answer to that is, he repeats the question, "Before she got to the first rail?</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.934" offset="12495078">Answer, "I didn't see her until she got her foot over the rail in the middle of the rails."</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.049" offset="12527574">That's on page 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.255" offset="12544397">Now, may I say this to the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.102" offset="12559757">This is the plan with its scale shows that the distance from the end to the platform to the nearer rail is two and a half feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.533" offset="12605524">The testimony of a number of witnesses which I won't refer to in detail now was that this woman didn't -- not that she dived onto the track or plunged onto the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.271" offset="12648469">The testimony was, she walked slowly onto the track and if that be so, she most certainly did not or the jury need not have found that she took her step of two and a half feet on her first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.399" offset="12728926">She was a woman, 52 years old and I think the jury would amply warrant the finding that she could not have arrived in the middle of the track on her first step and must have done so on her second step or at some later step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.764" offset="12810428">Now, if that is so it appears very persuasively from the evidence that I can summarize that what happened is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.354" offset="12860792">When the engineer was here, Mrs. Montell was taking her first step off the platform and placing her foot between the platform and the nearer rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.998" offset="12919411">He could not see her with them because of the baggage trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.370" offset="12944802">As he passed from here to here, the baggage trucks ceased to obscure his view and at the same time, she took her second step across the nearer rail and he saw her in the middle of the tracks and that is his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.849" offset="13030797">Now, that places him 180 feet from her, nine seconds away.</text>

            <text syncTime="4127.511" offset="16613439">There's no effort for her own safety, but in our mind, the liability here doesn't depend on whether or not Mrs. Montell was killed or whether or not Mrs. Montell could've been saved by due care.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.663" offset="16678013">It is perfectly possible to take a view of this evidence which is to the effect that the engineer could've been entirely careful for the plaintiff and yet killed Mrs. Montell and we attach no importance to the paranoia delusion which our client unquestionably had as the result of this evidence except to show that the paranoia is causally connected with this particular event.</text>
