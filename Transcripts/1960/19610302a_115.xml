            <label>Mr. Claude Pepper</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- habitual offender of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2.324" offset="112619">Now, the reason I say that it appears that the Florida Supreme Court has not decided the question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.374" offset="136861">In the subsequent case of Milan versus the State, a Florida case in 1958, when that question was presented, then the Court erred -- as to the second question, their Supreme Court had said -- the -- the Supreme Court of Florida held that the general statutes of limitations barred prosecution for an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.564" offset="213661">Now, here is the language of the Court, "The first of the above questions," as quote, "is not before the Court because there is no showing that appellant had actually said his entire sentence for the second offense, before the amended information was filed, charging him with being a second offender."</text>
            <text syncTime="45.451" offset="285132">On this question, there is a difference of opinion among the members of the Court but as it is not right for determination under the record here, no useful purpose could be served by discussing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.980" offset="335287">Now, what our suggestion want to do that the Florida Supreme Court in that later case, indicating that they didn't decide this question because there was a difference of opinion among the Justices of the Court, this Court might well apply the doctrine that where the State Supreme Court has not made an authoritative interpretation of a statute, this Court, when the matter is properly before it, may place its own interpretation upon the statute which in this case, to avoid the question of unconstitutionality on the ground of not observing due process, would require the Court to construe the statute to mean as the Court, in the Nelson case indicated, it might have been intended to mean that it only gave jurisdiction to the Court after a man had begun the service of his sentence or after the expiration of a term.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.511" offset="537370">But they didn't go so far as to apply to a case where a man had completed his service of the felony sentence and was free without any previous notice, without any concealment or without any conduct on his part that deterred the State from -- from bringing him within the encompass of the habitual offender statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.173" offset="612080">So I'm saying, Your Honors, is that I would be grateful if the Court would take into account and keep in mind that if you construe the statute that way, then, unless they've got some other authority upon which to hold a man, this statute would not be a sufficient ground for his incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.825" offset="682715">If they've got other grounds, of course, alright, let that appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.197" offset="696195">Alright, and to avoid an interpretation of the statute that would raise a serious question of due process as to whether it could apply in case the State had sat by with no fault, at least on the part of the defendant, and allowed him to serve his sentence, get credit for his good time, become presumably good citizen again, and then be, once more, apprehended and incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.456" offset="781145">Now, add all of these, if you can do it in one instance, in this case, he had two years and he served, let's say, one and three-quarter years.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.154" offset="815940">He -- the judge could have given him 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.141" offset="827956">Then, if what I say is not substantially true, Your Honor, what would prevent the Court from the first time he was apprehended under the habitual offender statute to say, “Alright, I'll give you three years this time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="192.510" offset="873409">He goes and serves the three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.886" offset="882918">Then, he gets out and goes about his business and five years later, they're bringing him in again and give him some more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.887" offset="906951">And he goes and serves again and they wait 20 years and bring him up again and he serves some more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.978" offset="931297">If there's not some constitutional principle, there's no statutory prohibition here in this Act against the Court waiting 50 years after he had finished the service of the felony sentence for which he was sentenced and then bringing him back again, after he's lived with family and lived an honorable life, and incarcerating him again for having been a habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.824" offset="1014680">I hope it may be within the scope of -- of this case, in the Court's review of it, to consider those questions, as well as the counsel's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.472" offset="1041220">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.744" offset="1082389">In essence, this question becomes one of whether or not the Florida Supreme Court, by denying this man -- this man's petition for habeas corpus, ruled in effect that Judge Amidon, by not granting him an extension of time to allow his counsel to appear in court to represent him, denied this man due process such of you -- such as you have recognized in a number of cases with which I don't take any exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.794" offset="1190536">Now, if it is any more than that, I'm not aware that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.001" offset="1203388">It simply is the question of the discretion used by Judge Amidon in either allowing or not allowing this man's counsel to appear.Now, that has to turn on one thing and one thing only, as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.261" offset="1256364">Despite the existence of Cash versus Culver, McNeal versus Culver or Capern, one or the other and Chandler versus Fretag, the Supreme Court of Florida could have relied on your decision in the case of Betts versus Brady wherein this Court concluded, albeit a number of the members who participated in that opinion are not here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.964" offset="1355212">There, you concluded in essence that if it did not result in a fundamental unfairness to deny counsel or to not allow counsel, that it wasn't such as would cause a reversal of a conviction in the state court simply on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.890" offset="1418951">That's my point here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.557" offset="1425638">If I can demonstrate to you that what happened to this man, as a result of the activities of the criminal court -- record of Polk County, was not any different than what have happened to him had counsel been there, then I think am free to assume that I fully take myself out of the ambit of not only Chandler versus Fretag but also Cash versus Culver on the -- on the status of Betts versus Brady, that is to say that you have not yet reversed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.952" offset="1643186">But, I think, in fairness to counsel, since he did not argue any points which he urged to be included in this record, that I ask the Court not to consider any references that I have in my brief to matters they hold the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.727" offset="1690311">I have made one or two in response to pleading by counsel, and I suggest now that the Court not consider them, wherever they may appear.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.862" offset="1734823">They were in reference to affidavits executed by the trial judge and by Mr. Laird, counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.464" offset="1765230">I referred to them, and I don't think it would be fair to have you consider my argument surrounding those instances since Mr. Pepper has stated that he is not going to proceed on matters that are not literally a part of the record before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.546" offset="1849553">If the Court please, the question of the constitutionality of this statute which was raised by the petitioner, the one that assails it for the possible basis that in its title, it lacks sufficient notice to the electors of the State that they did not know what it included.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.881" offset="1918934">His answer was very simply by the case of Baggett versus State at 22 So.2d for the reenactment of a bill into law every two years or whenever the legislature needs, cures the defect that might exist in the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.691" offset="1978180">Now, it doesn't cure any other constitutional -- constitutional defect except a title one.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.983" offset="1999287">That is to say, when it becomes a part of the codified laws of the State, you no longer rely on the title for information, but you do on the codification by the legislature in its adoption as a part of the revised code.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.596" offset="2049755">Now, the question about whether or not this man could have been arrested on the basis of this, since it does not charge an offense as such, I think this Court has held several times that the crime of -- or rather, the situation in which a multiple offender finds himself is not one of an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.612" offset="2121853">That is not a crime and therefore, the position was advanced by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.116" offset="2139826">Since it is not a crime, it is impossible to charge it in a warrant since the statutes of the State of Florida require that a warrant specify the offense for which a man is sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.328" offset="2336684">Now, if we go back to 907.01 in Florida statutes, it provides that when an indictment or an information is returned, indictment filed or information returned, that a capias shall issue for the arrest of the person, and that is very simply what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.606" offset="2397811">The record will reflect, I think on page 4, as filed in this Court that a capias was issued, bond set at $5000 and the man was, as the Senator correctly stated, picked up in Volusia County, some distance away from Polk County and brought back.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.478" offset="2457266">Now, the physical warrant or a capias was not -- obviously not given to the deputy, but he was picked up on a hold order.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.397" offset="2480985">That's done 1000 a day throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.174" offset="2492061">I find nothing offensive in that and of course, that he was against -- that he was brought in court against his will, I'll cheerfully concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.753" offset="2518392">Most of them are.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.723" offset="2526229">When he was brought into court, he did not suggest to the trial judge when his case was called for arraignment, and he was asked these -- these questions, whether or not he, in fact, was the man who was named in this information as having committed and found guilty of and served sentences for these other two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.848" offset="2594774">He did not say “I don't know why my lawyer isn't here, but he's on his way” or give some excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.858" offset="2618807">I contend that he, at least, should have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.185" offset="2632077">He should have told the judge that there was some reason why the lawyer wasn't there or made it known to him that he was trying his best to get the man there but couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.281" offset="2668544">Now, in the state of the record, I can't do anything but -- but imagine or suppose what the circumstances were, but I submit that if 10 defendants were in that same court that morning and each one of them asked for a continuance for that purpose, that it would, of course, destroy any ability to hold a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.654" offset="2742000">I don't know how long it took the lawyer to get there or that, in fact, that he had one except as he says in his brief or in his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.230" offset="2772302">Now, I submit that the simple refusal of the Court, even if we accept all this as true, to grant a continuance in order for counsel to get there is a little different than a denial of the right to secure counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.060" offset="2851610">It's simply one in which the Court is seeking to exercise some control over the process which it is about to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.256" offset="2876374">And I don't think that it is quite the subject of condemnation that others have been for similar areas but not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.177" offset="2908035">Now, the time limitation is it appears a very serious question here, and I don't know that the Court will ever have to get to it, I really doubt that you will, but to the extent that you may find it necessary to pass on the question of whether or not it is proper to proceed against the man as a multiple offender after he has completed the service of his second sentence, I will address this for your consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.958" offset="3007195">I'm satisfied that the Court is quite aware that a number of felony crimes, not only in the State of Florida, but as well throughout the several States and possibly in the federal system, are susceptible of a penalty which -- which includes nothing more than the payment of a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.020" offset="3075427">Now, let us assume that a man comes into court and is charged with a felony properly but in that felony prosecution and charge, there is an alternative given to the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.203" offset="3124224">He may either sentence the man to penal servitude or he may assess against him a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.288" offset="3148570">In either case, the man is guilty of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.499" offset="3161318">It's only the punishment that is allowed to be discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.684" offset="3174066">Then, let us say that that man is fortunate enough to have assessed against him the penalty of simply a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.134" offset="3203950">He then proceeds to the clerk and pays his fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.997" offset="3215339">I should like to know how we can proceed against him as a multiple offender if we can't do it after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.648" offset="3245955">We certainly can't do it while he's doing it because he's not serving anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.176" offset="3264031">All he's doing is paying a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.253" offset="3272391">He hands the money over and gets a receipt, I understand, and I don't know of any way if the argument is sound that we can proceed against that man after he had served his sentence because that was the only sentence, the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.274" offset="3324426">Now, if the argument presented by the petitioner in reference to this is good, it ought to cover that situation too, and I submit that it does not.</text>

            <label>Mr. George R. Georgieff</label>
            <text syncTime="862.425" offset="3553050">First, the provisions for a speedy trial contemplate that it shall be for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.002" offset="3579382">Second, they provide that if you do not move according to the provisions, I believe it's 916 (1), I'm not certain but it certainly was in Chapter 916, that it is an affirmative directive to the defendant that he shall move for a quick trial and if it is not done within a certain number of them, that is to say three of them, he must make three motions that he'd be brought to trial and if the State does not proceed against him or show good cause why it has not, then he is forever discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.825" offset="3710621">It is not an automatic thing unless he initiates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.099" offset="3723786">There was one case I can call to mind that the Supreme Court ruled on where 29 terms of court had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.038" offset="3747506">There were six a year, 29 terms of court had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.136" offset="3759940">The man was on -- out on bond, that is different, of course, than here but in any case he made no effort whatsoever to secure any speedy trial until such time as he found himself in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.557" offset="3805602">And then, of course, he came up and said, “Well, look what you've done to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.392" offset="3816991">You waited all this time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="929.871" offset="3822843">The Court said, “Yes, but the statute requires that you move and request that this trial be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.499" offset="3845413">If, in three terms, it is not granted, you are forever free unless good cause is shown.”</text>
            <text syncTime="940.549" offset="3865579">So, I don't think that the question of speedy trial quite includes this situation since there was no allegation made that he did not come within it or rather, that he did come within it, or that his circumstance was one of a crime, that is to say, since this is not offense, I must assume that it is also not a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.492" offset="6673324">Now, I would not hesitate to urge to my Supreme Court the illustration of the fine because I think it's proper and good, and I don't believe that if they could answer -- if they couldn't answer that, that they could, in good conscience, rule that you had to do it during the time the man was serving his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.078" offset="6747721">And to that end, I say that it would not be available to them on that basis, using that as my argument, to say that you must do it within the time that he's serving his sentence or else you can't.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.419" offset="6905083">But in this situation, of course, it was somewhat under three months, possibly by a few days, and I don't think that the activities against this man were such as would shock even your conscience considering the narrow avenues that might be involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.748" offset="7050324">Just the question of whether, within the narrow scope confined in this avenue, that is to say, his identity plus the normal defenses that are available to anybody, that this man was dealt with unfairly, and I don't think that the granting as a petition for cert was provident in this case, and I think that the Court ought to receive from this position initially taken here and deny the cert granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2600.254" offset="10504338">One of the reasons I brought up this question about due process in a case where the defendant had completed the service of his previous sentence was that if the record should show those facts here, and I suppose there's no dispute whatever about the man having completed the service of the sentence for which he was charged, that is, the grand larceny charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.703" offset="10590229">Now, if under these facts, there wouldn't be any justification for charging this man again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.641" offset="10613948">Well, then it would seem to be rather useless to go all the way even to the Supreme Court and let alone, to back to the Court of -- Criminal Court of Record of Polk County for -- for the decision of this matter again because that's not, so far as I assume, a factual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.562" offset="10681657">I don't think the State would dispute the fact that the man had already completed his service of the grand larceny sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.688" offset="10706108">Now, if that type, being assumed, would make it a violation of due process to apprehend him again after the completion of that sentence, then I thought that matter might well be within the scope of the consideration of this matter by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.691" offset="10770160">On the other points, Your Honor, this Court said through the able Chief Justice in the Fretag case, of course, regardless of whether petitioner would have been entitled to the appointment of counsel, his right to be heard through his own counsel was unqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.778" offset="10830451">And I rather input from the brief of the State as the Chief Justice did, that the -- the State was taking the position that because there wasn't any effective defense that an attorney could have presented in the Court that sentenced this man under the habitual offender statute that, therefore, he had suffered no harm, and there wasn't any -- anything that -- that need be done for him here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.250" offset="10916342">I would simply say, in my reference to the -- to the two Cash decisions of the Supreme Court of Florida after the -- the Cash-Culvert decision by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.142" offset="10955943">Why did that Court, evidently having ignored the principle of Cash versus Culvert decided by this Court in this case, September the 15th, 1959, five months after the Cash-Culvert decision by this case, in another case and where counsel were present and where a due consideration was given to the matter, had now affirmed the principle of Cash versus Culvert and of -- and of Chandler versus Fretag as the doctrines of the Supreme Court of Florida which they will apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.307" offset="11072554">But I didn't mean, in any manner, to suggest that the -- that this man should be left to the speculation by this Court of what the Supreme Court of Florida might decide because the -- the Cash-Fre -- the Cash-Culvert case had already been decided by this Court and in the -- in the books, four or five months prior to the time the Supreme Court of Florida denied this petition, presumably in the light of those second and third of that -- second and third Cash cases, they would so hold but, certainly, as the Chief Justice had intimated, this case is before this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.844" offset="11214764">And I would take it, if the principle is right that due process was denied by the denial of counsel, that it would be proper to -- to grant this certiorari so that the Supreme Court of Florida will do what it did in -- under the Cash versus Culvert decision of this Court, say that it was under the mandate of this Court to issue the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.498" offset="11293341">I add only, in respect to the question of Mr. Justice Whittaker, that the statute, in respect to the man's saying that he was the same person as convicted under the previous conviction, the statute says, “If the jury finds that he is the same person or if he acknowledges or confesses in open court after being duly cautioned as to his rights, that he is the same person.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.197" offset="11396159">And the record of this judgment is silent here as to his being informed about any right that he possessed, let alone the right to a jury, the right to question whether the identity existed or not or any other point that may -- that may have been raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="2867.421" offset="11573060">Of course, it's an unqualified right to have your own counsel if you can afford it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.254" offset="11588420">But nevertheless, we pointed out a number of -- of things that an attorney could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.945" offset="11607124">Mr. Justice Douglas called attention to some and other of the Justices or the Chief Justice had called attention to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.466" offset="11633246">We could well have contended -- any competent lawyer would have contended to the Court that in the light of the Nelson case and the Milan case, that the Florida Supreme Court had never determined whether or not their statute was intended to apply to a case where the last sentence had already been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.959" offset="11707225">That could well have been argued and should have been considered and passed upon by the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.129" offset="11727914">The constitutionality that I -- I would have had much to have said in reply to what counsel for the States had amended ago, that under our statute, only one subject under our constitution in regard to legislation, only one subject can be dealt within a statute and that subject has to be clearly expressed in the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.568" offset="11801684">And here, in view of the law of Florida, that once the court's term had expired or once the defendant had entered upon the service of the sentence, the court then lost jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.395" offset="11844942">It's grievously doubtful as to whether or not a legislator would have been informed in passing upon this habitual offender statute that it meant to create new jurisdiction in courts not only after the term had expired or after the man had begun the service of his sentence, but it meant to give the court jurisdiction for an indefinite time after he had completed the service of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.005" offset="11931355">I can well imagine that legislators might have had entirely different opinions about that aspect of the matter of which they had no advice in the title of the statute if they were entitled to have under the provisions of our constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3040.267" offset="12264469">And by the way, this man, in his petition, refers to the case of Patch versus State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.027" offset="12291532">I believe it is Patch versus, I think, it's State or Patch versus (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.784" offset="12310549">They tell me that down at the state prison, they have what they call a prisoner's library when they passed around these pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.243" offset="12336358">That's the reason sometimes, in a -- in the petition of a man like this, you will find some good phrasing then you will find him saying some things that are utterly ungrammatical at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.244" offset="12368332">I suspect that maybe, possibly, he copied something that he picked up, and I don't think it shows you that this man was an able man, so far as that's concerned or -- or an informed man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.714" offset="12406262">But nevertheless, in that Patch case, the Florida Supreme Court considered the practice that has prevailed by the courts of Florida for quite a long while and condemn the practice and -- and require the -- the determination of the practice, that is, that after a man was convicted, the Court would just indefinitely withhold sentence and sometimes that withholding went on for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.469" offset="12501243">A man would be subject any time to be brought back and -- and sent to prison under a sentence he'd been convicted by a jury, let's say, but instead of a sentence being imposed within a reasonable time, the Court would just put him on probation, as it were, by just not imposing a sentence, by holding it in the bosom of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.129" offset="12583894">Well, now, the Florida Supreme Court pointed out that -- and this man said, “Does a man never to know in substance when he's subject to be called back and incarcerated in prison as it were?</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.575" offset="12625690">Does he have no certainty about his liberty and that sort of thing?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.398" offset="12640946">So, the Florida Supreme Court laid down a principle which I think might, under due process, apply to the length of time in which these charges of being a habitual offender might be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.574" offset="12689638">The Court said unless there's some real justifiable reason for the Court withholding the imposition of a sentence, like a motion for a new trial or a motion and a rest of judgment or for some other reason, it would be a normal as -- just as indicated this morning in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.255" offset="12752436">Should -- should we hold it for this reason or there's some real justifiable reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.790" offset="12770513">Why, it's a duty of the Court to impose whatever sentence he's going to impose, give the man a right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.140" offset="12791933">You can't appeal from a sentence that's never been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.221" offset="12804263">You've got to have a final judgment before you can appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.278" offset="12816488">Give the man a chance to appeal or to move for a new trial or rest of judgment or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.812" offset="12838640">And then, if you're going to give him probation, give him probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.161" offset="12852015">Then, you know what the man's rights are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.659" offset="12862046">And so -- so the Court laid down the principle that even dealing with courts, you ought to act promptly with the -- with the -- promptly or there's got to be some reason, and I say the same thing should apply to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.242" offset="12908335">The order -- the state order act promptly or there ought to be some justifiable reason or under facts like this, it's not due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.414" offset="12941040">Thank you.</text>
