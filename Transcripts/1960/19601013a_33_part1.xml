            <text syncTime="592.575" offset="2473671">It was the trial court's opinion that under circumstances where a person is subpoenaed to bring in records of an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.365" offset="2516825">He must make an explanation if he does not bring the records as to why he does not bring them or as to whether he has them or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.327" offset="2604701">The Court relied on the Bryan and Fleischman cases to support his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.428" offset="2645034">And before I discuss those two cases, which I think is crucial to this decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.027" offset="2679515">I want to indicate to the Court that I filed a request to charge, which appeared in the transcript on page 74 after he overruled my motion for directed verdict that the jury be constructed, that they have to find that there were records in existence and that the defendant of the case had the possession of it all -- of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.045" offset="2791528">And the -- the Court did not give the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.768" offset="2806471">He rejected it and instead he gave a charge which on page 67 of the transcript told the jury that they were not to concern themselves with whether the defendant have the record or whether there were any records in existence or whether he, the defendant, had any relationship to the Civil Rights Congress, because not having and made an explanation before the committee that he could not present the matter in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.247" offset="2920364">And the jury was in fact, advise that they could determine, but without any relationship to existence or possession of record whether the defendant was guilty of willfully refusing to produce the records before the committee and in fact, I think it was a charge almost or a directed verdict because no other issues in the case were in dispute here and everything else was conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.288" offset="3052544">Now, that comes to the question of the meaning of the Bryan and Fleischman decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.238" offset="3088280">In Bryan and Fleischman, this Court held that where a witness appeared before a congressional committee for the purpose of using records called for by subpoenaing and did not produce the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.814" offset="3170617">But later, when brought to trial for contempt, the witness sought to raise the issue of lack of a quorum before the committee at the time the witness appeared there that the witness would not be permitted to raise that issue at the contempt of trial, because the witness had not advised the committee at the time of her appearance of her claim of lack of a quorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.679" offset="3298095">Now, it is our position here that if the Bryan and Fleischman -- that the Bryan and Fleishcman rule applied -- as applied by this Court, in the situation where the claim may dealt with a procedural matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.047" offset="3359535">The question of a quorum or the lack of a quorum was a procedural matter and that the defendant in that case or in those cases not having raise the procedural issue which the committee had a right or was in a position to resolve or correct at the time of the appearance, could not be later raised as a defense of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.140" offset="3451904">But we think that it is extending the rule far beyond the intent of the Court in announcing it in the first place and would if applied to a situation like this, take away for the defendants in a criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.978" offset="3515329">The presumption of innocence to apply it to several -- to eliminate, to the essential elements in the proof of guilt in this case, because to prove the defendant guilty of willfully refusing or failing to produce records, two of the elements in that case, which have been held in many decisions of this Court to be essential elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.524" offset="3617520">First, that there are such records in existence and second, that the defendant was in a position to produce and did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.426" offset="3653047">And yet, by using the rule announced in Bryan and Fleischman with respect to a procedural point, standing to two of the essential elements in the crime, I think the Court has -- the Court felt or the law must concede to hold purpose of contempt to Bryan and Fleischman and would be drafted into the criminal law to a rather noble and new and far-reaching concept by which a person could wave his rights to a trial by jury with the presumption of innocence and the burden upon the Government to prove the essential grounds of a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.880" offset="3942902">But if the Court will read from the trial court's decision in denying the motion for directed verdict and compare -- it appears on page 61 of the transcript of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.691" offset="4006118">I think it is clear that the court's rationale was same -- is the same as this Court in Bryan and Fleischman.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.755" offset="4034435">That is that when the witness appears before a committee, it is necessary at that time to make an objection or to make an explanation so as to give the committee at that time an opportunity of correcting the defect or irregularity, and the Court so said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.542" offset="4105592">And therefore, the Court said, in this case, McPhaul when he appeared before the committee, should have made an explanation concerning the records with their existence or whether he have them or whether he was related to the Civil Rights Congress, because if he had done so, the trial court said, then the committee could have done something else to find those records.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.253" offset="4280404">Because after all the trial took place two and a half years after it appeared before the committee and the Court's reasoning and logic was correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.528" offset="4497533">But I think that it is also clear with respect to this matter that if the Court was of the view that this was a matter of substantive proof and that the issue could be litigated at the trial, the Court would've allowed the matter to go to the jury for determination as a jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.521" offset="4581439">And I think logically from his point of view, he did not permit it to go to the jury even though he requested that would be done after he denied our motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.156" offset="4616025">It was logical from his point of view because his position was he couldn't even be litigated to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.374" offset="4636818">Therefore, the jury couldn't determine the issue whether there were more or less facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.612" offset="4681853">Now, the Government in its brief here on appeal, does not accept this rationale of the trial court nor of the Court of Appeals to form down the same ground on defining Bryan and Fleischman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.389" offset="4752906">As I understand the Government's argument here, it is that while it is true, the Government says that a witness owes a duty for the committee when subpoenaed before to present some kind of an explanation with respect to the records where there is a reasonable basis for issuing the subpoena and for believing that the person to whom the subpoena is issued, could bring the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.135" offset="4871920">That at that point, assuming there is in the record a reasonable basis for the issuance of the subpoena to this particular person, the Government argues then the burden shifts at the trial to the defendant at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.511" offset="4933465">In other words, I think what in fact the Government has done here is -- I think the position that the issue could be litigated at the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.893" offset="5870947">He was subpoenaed and the name, Arthur McPhaul, present the record in the Civil Rights Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.384" offset="5904906">Now, there are several suppositions that one may make in the absence of any testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.838" offset="5926745">One is that he did have a record, but he held them not in the representative capacity but in an individual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.315" offset="5968645">Now if he did hold the records belonging to an organization in an individual capacity and not in a representative capacity under the many decisions of this Court, he could refuse to produce those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.291" offset="6028518">And he will not be in contempt to the committee for refusing to do so if he asserted his constitutional privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.659" offset="6073971">And his final answer then, I will not produce the records if based as I think it could well be said here on this constitutional privilege would be one for which he could not be held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.541" offset="6125484">So that -- that's one possibility that he was not holding the records in any official capacity, which eventually will not be guilty of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.558" offset="6165608">Now, in this case, there is no evidence of any kind that McPhaul get hold any records in any representative capacity, none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.496" offset="6225377">And in the absence of such a connecting link between the individual who said I will not produce the record then has a right to say so if they're not in a representative capacity.</text>
