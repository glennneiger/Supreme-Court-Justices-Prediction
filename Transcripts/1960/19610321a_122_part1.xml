            <label>Mr. Melvin B.lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="34.356" offset="240828">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.208" offset="260159">This matter comes on -- on petition for certiorari to the -- and on the grant of that petition, the writ of certiorari issuing to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.890" offset="306970">We here invoked the general supervisory powers vested in Your Honors and hope likewise to be able to demonstrate to Your Honors a very serious constitutional deficiency in the proceedings below, which we trust will merit Your Honors' consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.902" offset="382934">At the inception of the litigation in about August of 1959, the petitioner, Armando Piemonte, was in federal custody serving a six-year sentence for the sale of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.160" offset="436015">He was brought in from his place of confinement where he was lodged pursuant to final mittimus.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.652" offset="466004">The proceedings consequent upon his being brought in, have to be somewhat interpolated from the record, but are, nonetheless, I think, quite plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.585" offset="505710">Giving them chronologically, he had a conference with the prosecutor who had caused him to be brought there, a special attorney of the Department of Justice, special agent, I believe, he's referred to some places in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.102" offset="563806">He asked to the prosecutor that he'd be allowed to call a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.105" offset="583764">The lawyer was indeed called and the -- and he -- as -- the lawyer spoke with the prosecutor who arranged for him to see the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.840" offset="622738">There was a conference between the defendant and his lawyer following which the defendant, then theoretically a witness, was called before the grand jury as a -- as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.890" offset="670908">He claimed self-incrimination as to the various questions propounded to him, which, I think, painted broadly, could be said to deal with the general subject of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.174" offset="720018">The prosecutor engaged in a colloquy at that time with the defendant in which he intimated -- read it strongly to the defendant that there was no area of privilege with reference to his being asked where he had obtained the narcotics for whose sale he was then serving a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.876" offset="794833">The defendant said something to the effect that he hadn't understood everything that his lawyer had told him, but that -- well, I think to quote him directly, “I ain't answering no questions," or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.673" offset="850108">He, thereupon, persisted in his refusal and was brought back before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.241" offset="876335">In the proceedings before the Court, which occurred some days subsequent to his grand jury appearance, the lawyer, whose identity was, of course, known to the prosecutor, who -- and who had, in fact, spoken with the prosecutor on a prior occasion, was not called or notified so far as the record discloses.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.565" offset="949582">The defendant was brought before the Court and they -- there held a hearing in which he was not represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.113" offset="995871">The prosecutor at this time advised the Court that lest there should be any questions, he was desirous that the Court should know that based upon some recent decisions of the appellate court, as he phrased it, he now felt that the petitioner's constitutional claim of privilege was proper as to all questions propounded to him, including those relating to the prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.735" offset="1090330">The Court, in his response, expressed doubt as to whether the constitutional immunity would apply in that aspect but agreed that as to all the remaining questions, the constitutional claim of privilege was indeed proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.504" offset="1153337">The Court, thereupon, advised the defendant that in -- herewith, granted him immunity, that it was, therefore, no longer necessary for him to claim possible self-incrimination and it directed that he be required to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.073" offset="1243617">I would've -- I would like to depart from my factual presentation to urge the Court at this particular time so that the rest of the statements would be framed in their proper context, that there never was a direction to the defendant at any stage that he answer any specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.495" offset="1313311">He was told rather to answer -- the -- the most frequently recurring phrase is, "Answer the questions propounded to you".</text>
            <text syncTime="310.859" offset="1346853">And I think it could be argued equally well on the face of this record that he was ordered to answer such questions as might in the future be propounded to him or such questions as might, in the past, have been propounded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.347" offset="1404740">The significance of the distinction there is something that I will come to later, but I think at this point, I think it is not inappropriate to observe to Your Honors that the point never did come where the petitioner was told, "Answer this specific question," by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.047" offset="1491571">Now, Piemonte, at this time, the -- the petitioner when he -- when the Court told him that he was granted immunity, that he no longer had to worry about self-incrimination and that he ought, therefore, answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.095" offset="1535770">He asked if he might be permitted to talk to his lawyer and the Court said that indeed, he could, and that the grand jury should not further interrogate the petitioner until he had seen his lawyer and the Court further observed that the petitioner would be represented by counsel and upon hearing held prior to the imposition of any penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.822" offset="1622706">However, at this time, the -- I -- I don't believe that there could be any possible tenable theory by which the defendant was, in fact, in contempt at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.711" offset="1670248">The next procedural development was the entry of a written order.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.523" offset="1693445">The written order is not shown to have been brought to the petitioner's attention in any manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.387" offset="1712880">I think I may fairly state to this Court that all of the record inferences are against it, but we needn't go that far because of the fact that the -- the burden, I think, being concededly upon the prosecution to sustain all elements of criminal contempt in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.391" offset="1776933">The least we can say is that there is no showing that, in fact, it was brought to his attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.068" offset="1795636">The order does -- again, this written order does not direct answers to specific questions but rather states that the defendant, and I believe, I'm fairly well quoting it, that the defendant shall not be excused from testifying on the grounds that his testimony or any evidence presented by him, may tend to incriminate him but that he shall answer the questions propounded to him, again, the recurring phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.309" offset="1896573">The defendant was then brought back before the grand jury, and he was reminded that the -- by the prosecutor that the judge had -- as the prosecutor phrased it, "Granted you immunity and ordered you to answer questions in," -- generally, I think the prosecutor's phrase was concerning narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.224" offset="1964283">The response of the -- the petitioner was, "I stand on the Fifth Amendment."</text>
            <text syncTime="472.530" offset="1993540">And the prosecutor said, "Well, he's going to go ahead anyhow," and asked the questions on which the privilege had been claimed and repeats them to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.301" offset="2040560">And he proceeded -- substantially to do that, he added, for the first time in the second grand jury presentations, questions concerning two persons, Nathaniel Spurlock and Jeremiah Pullings.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.560" offset="2093641">Pullings will appear later in the presentation as a codefendant with the petitioner on the indictment subsequently returned against the petitioner by that same grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.100" offset="2139721">The petitioner stood by his refusal to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.326" offset="2152678">A rule to show cause was entered against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.956" offset="2163231">His lawyer was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.150" offset="2167933">He persisted in his refusal to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.261" offset="2180368">He asked the -- where jury to demand was refused, the hearing -- and the hearing was held on the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.421" offset="2201057">The Government rested on the transcript in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.184" offset="2216103">The defendant testified that the basis for his refusal to answer questions that the -- the real reason why he wouldn't answer was fear of underworld retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.487" offset="2257272">And after some colloquy between the Court and prosecuting counsel as to whether or not, six months were the maximum permissive sentence, he was sentenced to a period of 18 months on the assurance of the special agent for the Department of Justice that he had himself been party to proceedings wherein sentences of that nature had, in the past, been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.132" offset="2339924">On August 27th, some nine days following the sentence, the petitioner filed his notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.116" offset="2367822">Five or six days after the filing of the notice of appeal, there was return of an indictment by the same grand jury before which he had declined to testify</text>
            <text syncTime="576.618" offset="2409827">The indictment charged the petitioner here and the gentleman, Pullings, who, I mentioned before, I used the term "gentleman" not in an analytic sense, but rather I -- I don't know the man, and it seems in -- in problems that I should do otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.607" offset="2477850">The indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.703" offset="2490180">It was subsequently tried and the Government has filed a supplemental memorandum in this case in which it indicates that the -- that the petitioner here was found not guilty on that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.715" offset="2526229">I suppose that the Government will probably explain to the Court what the relevance of the not guilty is, but we have certain submissions to make predicated upon the indictment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.712" offset="2570219">Now, we complained to Your Honors first and -- and addressed ourselves to you Your Honors' general supervisory power and suggest that the summary nature of these proceedings, the speed, the mechanical nature of the processing, almost as though they were -- were gears grinding through the -- the courtroom was of such a nature that it really will not support the contempt adjudication that was predicated on -- on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.963" offset="2675231">I would remind Your Honors that the defendant was hold from the penitentiary to the courthouse that he was given a -- a hearing at which no lawyer was present, even though the identity of his lawyer was known to the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.145" offset="2739911">The issue of the confusion relative to the prior conviction can only have served to convince the defendants that he was as well of keeping his own counsel as that of the persons who undertook to advise him both at his request and -- at -- those who undertook to advise him sua sponte, so to speak, and certainly with unsolicited advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.370" offset="2836877">In that area, I -- I would like to make myself clear particularly in view of ceratin language contained in the Piemonte -- pardon me, in the -- in the Reina decision recently issued by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.729" offset="2886301">Giacomo Reina, I believe, is the name of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.083" offset="2895705">In that case, a question arose as to whether immunity would properly extend to questions relating to the prior conviction of a defendant called before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.243" offset="2952338">There is -- as Your Honors there indicated, very waivy authority to the proposition that there is no immunity in that specific area.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.626" offset="2985880">But that is -- that is something of no application to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.719" offset="3010226">In Reina, as I read the decision, the defendant would have been convicted, I believe, of the sale of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.686" offset="3034154">He was asked essentially something to the effect of to whom he had sold it, a matter directly related to the conviction and encompass completely therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.102" offset="3067800">There, the -- the question of whether he had any immunity remaining as to that aspect of the thing is quite beside the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.380" offset="3096848">For here, the petitioner was asked something vastly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.176" offset="3112103">He was asked where he had obtained the heroin for whose sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.726" offset="3130284">He had thereafter been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.630" offset="3137912">The purchase of the heroin, the -- it -- and its subsequent possession and so forth, presents offenses quite distinct from the sale of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.147" offset="3183992">And offenses which might well have been punished by cumulative sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.259" offset="3200397">So that I submit to Your Honors that being convicted of sale does not deprive a man of any constitutional immunity that he otherwise possesses relative to his acquisition of that heroin for which he can be quite separately and additionally punished.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.663" offset="3374059">I believe firmly that there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.665" offset="3382000">But rather whether the proceedings below where characterized by such procedural regularity as to support a contempt adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.556" offset="3409586">In other words, we -- we would urge, Mr. Justice Whittaker, that it -- it need not necessarily be one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.920" offset="3431006">The -- the proceedings -- it just doesn't follow as an ironclad rule that if the proceedings are sufficiently regular to have conferred immunity at a subsequent stage, they are necessarily sufficiently regular to support a contempt adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.256" offset="3476355">That surely there is a -- a shadow area where giving the benefit to the defendant under the -- such a statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="865.985" offset="3567261">I allude Your -- Your Honor to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.885" offset="3578964">The statute requires, in order that a grant of immunity be consequent upon one's appearance before a grand jury or a court, the following steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.073" offset="3631626">First, the witness, as he is termed at that point, the -- the witness must be -- must receive -- there must be propounded to him one or more questions which he refuses to answer on the grounds that his testimony may tend to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.448" offset="3709158">Secondly, sir, he must be brought before the Court and such one or more questions, as the Court of Appeals he ought properly to answer, are then certified as questions which he must answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.736" offset="3774360">Upon his answering those questions, he acquires immunity, once that procedure is followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.271" offset="3800482">Now, of course, it requires certain ancillary procedure as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.383" offset="3812916">There must be a proper petition presented by the prosecution and the -- the court must make certain basic findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.280" offset="3852518">But I submit to Your Honor that the immunity statute, as written, will not support a general direction to a defendant to answer questions, just go answer questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.016" offset="4843395">Now, in order for him to assert his immunity at a subsequent stage, he must show -- the burden will be on him to show, first, that he went before the court or grand jury and that he claimed constitutional immunity with reference to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.639" offset="4917896">Secondly, that he was, thereafter, ordered to answer the question over his claim of constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.331" offset="4944645">Third, that the question was then a game propounded to him in pursuance of the court order entered in -- under the statute, and that he, thereupon, answered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.247" offset="5000338">And fourth, he must show that his answer relates to the subject matter of the subsequent criminal accusation made against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.616" offset="5029804">Now, it is -- for that reason, Mr. Justice Brennan, that I earnestly urge to -- upon this Court the proposition that a general direction to a witness, "go answer questions", will not properly energize the immunity statute with which we are here dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.607" offset="5109844">And the reason that that is so very fundamentally true is because of the fact that the immunity will attach only under the terms of the statute to such questions as have been asked without reference to the immunity statute, which the witness has refused to answer on the grounds of possible self-incrimination and which, thereafter, if -- if it please the Court, he is directed specifically to answer and then answers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.265" offset="6328404">In reference to the case at bar, the defendant was called in before the grand jury and was asked some, well, roughly speaking 100 questions before the grand jury as to all of which he claimed his constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.083" offset="6379708">He then went back before the court and the court told him to answer questions propounded to you before the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.215" offset="6424221">He was asked for the first time before that grand jury concerning certain activities of a man named Pullings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.196" offset="6456195">Subsequently, he was indicted by that same grand jury for having conspired with Pullings for the sale of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.078" offset="6483675">Now, I suggest to Your Honor that had he obeyed the Court's order and had he gone back and simply testified as to everything that was asked of him, it could be very tenably and, I think, unassailably argued in the -- with reference to this very identical subsequent indictment returned against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.214" offset="6576253">It could be very tenably argued and, I think, successfully that as to the questions concerning Pullings, he had never claimed his constitutional immunity, his privilege against self-incrimination</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.400" offset="6745004">He went back before the grand jury for the second time, if it please the Court, some four or five days later.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.012" offset="11911398">I don't think that this Court, -- for example, I don't think that this Court would ever approve a situation in which a defendant might be indicted with say four other men at a total four-count indictment relating to narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.466" offset="11973256">That he might be then called to the witness stand and forced to testify on count 1, exposing thereby his -- his basic criminality or -- or lack of reliability to the jurors for consideration on their other three counts which may not be met the transactions, matters or things concerning which he has compelled to testify under the -- under the specific grand of immunity given him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.442" offset="12077119">I think that this Court can very well concede that a grant of immunity may be so limited as to -- restricted to the transaction of the sale of narcotics to Jones and to have no application at all to the sale of narcotics to Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.056" offset="12135633">Now, if either this statute will authorize a man's being called as -- as a witness against his codefendants on other counsel that a trial where -- where he is himself defendant to a count or else it will not admit the procedure that was adopted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.980" offset="12207313">I suggest to Your Honors that by choosing to treat the defendant as a defendant by indicting him for a substantive offence, he became justified in his refusal to have answered questions theretofore.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.369" offset="12300831">I say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.513" offset="12317445">The statute deprives a man of the right to refuse to testify on the grounds that his testimony may tend to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.118" offset="12359868">But the fact that his testimony may tend to incriminate him is a derivative doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.734" offset="12382333">The Constitution does not expressly, in so many words, give a man a guarantee against the giving of testimony that might -- may serve to incriminate him at a subsequent time in a -- in a different form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.337" offset="12428727">Rather what the Constitution provides, in so many words, is that a citizen -- that a -- an individual may not be called to -- as a witness against himself in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.732" offset="12490271">That he may not be required to -- to give evidence against himself in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.846" offset="12514722">Now, if it please the Court, subsequent to this, there has derived a -- a derivative doctrine on this which says that in no form, at anytime, can you compel a man, absent immunity statutes, to give testimony which may serve to incriminate him subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.638" offset="12589955">You cannot force Jones to give evidence in Smith's trial that may incriminate Jones where he, thereafter, indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.460" offset="12621197">That's the derivative doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.127" offset="12627884">The basic constitutional doctrine is that a man cannot be forced in a criminal case to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.321" offset="12664665">The grand jury proceedings are, I think, by settled decisions of this Court, part of the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.623" offset="12693817">The question was the criminal case against whom, at the time that he -- that -- that the defendant was there before the -- the grand jury at all times, thereafter, up to the time -- up to the very time of his sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.563" offset="12749615">It was a good -- have been impossible for him to substantiate the claim that this was a criminal case against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.787" offset="12778559">But it was, and the distinction is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.563" offset="12793605">If Jones be called as a witness in Smith's trial, he is excused from answering questions only on the grounds that those answers may tend to incriminate him, Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.616" offset="12837804">If he doesn't -- if he doesn't say that, he can be forced to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.065" offset="12855672">If Smith be called in Smith's trial, Smith cannot be forced to testify at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.735" offset="12886288">He need not say his estimony may tend to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.440" offset="12905096">He has an absolute privilege against being called to testify at all in a criminal case against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.838" offset="12942712">Now, the statute, the immunity statute, with which we are here confronted, says nothing at all, nor could it, I believe, proper to say anything at all about taking away the right of an individual to refuse to be a witness against himself in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.420" offset="13005093">Rather it takes away the derivative right, the right to refuse to give answers in proceedings other than a direct criminal case against the witness himself, which may serve to incriminate him later in a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.263" offset="13084400">That's the right that's taken away by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.072" offset="13099656">I suggest to Your Honors that had the indictment been returned against Piemonte, the appellant here, before his sentencing for contempt, have that been done, no sentence for contempt would have been possible because of the fact that the worst thing that could be said against the appellant in that circumstance, is that he was sought to be punished for refusing to become a witness against himself in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.455" offset="13237164">Surely, if you take the view that he was properly granted immunity, he no longer had the right to refuse to testify on the grounds that his testimony might incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.070" offset="13275617">But he still had the very viable robust right not to give testimony against himself in a criminal case, and this is a right which is not affected by the immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.438" offset="13337161">And I, therefore, submit to the Court that by indicting Piemonte, the grand jury treated him as a defendant rather than a witness in ultimate terms in the final analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.515" offset="13389406">That's what he was, was a defendant, and a defendant cannot be compelled in a criminal case to give evidence against himself, and the immunity statute does not touch upon that aspect of the rights under the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore George Gilinsky</label>
            <text syncTime="3370.885" offset="13586892">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.488" offset="13613328">In the Government's view, the petitioner does not raise any of the problems which were remaining in Reina or which were dealt with in Reina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.537" offset="13673514">And as a matter of fact, what this case really is about then is whether or not on this record in the District Court, this petitioner was fully advised and was granted immunity as a matter of fact and understood what he was supposed to do and whether he disobeyed that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.382" offset="13788871">In order to understand whether or not the petitioner clearly understood on whether he then deliberately disobeyed the order and thus arose the contempt, it's necessary to go over the facts somewhat and perhaps repeat some that have been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.000" offset="13895346">The first thing that happened was on August 10th, when the petitioner was called for this grand jury hearing, I think it's important to -- in considering whether or not, he understood and whether or not he committed contempt to view the entire proceeding of what happened at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.569" offset="13993671">One, there is no question on this record that the petitioner consulted with his attorney prior to the time he entered into the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.812" offset="14062634">There is no question that he talked to his attorney specifically about answering questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.387" offset="14096906">As a matter of fact, what happened was this petitioner, despite advice from his attorney, told his attorney that he was not going to answer any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.997" offset="14155316">He was going to stand on the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.697" offset="14170154">That's number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.060" offset="14179662">The second thing that's important is that as we started to ask the questions at the grand jury, the first thing that we asked the petitioner was in regard to his previous conviction, which he readily admit, and the next series of questions were related to that particular conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.565" offset="14289586">It is true, it is true that the Government, at that time, told the petitioner that he did not think the petitioner had the right to claim the privilege insofar as those questions were related to the convictions on which he was then serving time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.499" offset="14381328">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.737" offset="14386343">And as -- immediately after that thatthe petitioner note -- said, "Well, I'm not going to answer any questions."</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.150" offset="14419989">After that, the Government asked a series of approximately 50 some questions, having to do generally with narcotics, having to do with -- in some instances with the conviction, this heroin that he had previously sold, having to do with marijuana, having to do with his knowledge of such people as John Omento (ph) from New York, having to do with his knowledge of a previous codefendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.653" offset="14558020">And all of these questions, the petitioner declined to answer claiming the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.583" offset="14581739">Now, that's on August 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.028" offset="14599502">On August 13, this matter was presented before Judge Campbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.094" offset="14627715">At that time, the Government said, “We believe that the petitioner properly claimed his privilege in the light of some recent appellate cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.431" offset="14685080">The Government then explained to the judge what they were there for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.522" offset="14705455">That they were there to present this transcript to the grand jury to the judge so that he could decide and that they would -- going to present a petition to the court for a grant of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.592" offset="14765746">The Court was presented with the transcript and the court read, quite obviously in this record, read the questions that were asked and the answer that were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.261" offset="14812453">And the Court expressed doubt as to whether the privilege was properly claimed as to those question which related to the conviction, but the court also said as to the adage, there was no question however that the privilege was properly claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.378" offset="14900851">At that point, the Government presented to the court a written petition, which I do not believe is challenged by this petitioner as to form, setting out everything that was required in the statute, and I might say this isn't the exact type of petition that were presented in Reina, Corona, as a matter of fact, in almost all the narcotic cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.534" offset="15009520">The crucial point that the Government feels is important to understand is what happened next.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.461" offset="15049226">The court said, "Very well, I find the petition in proper form, the same is granted."</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.311" offset="15096665">As far as the Government is concerned, that was it, no further finding, no further interrogation, no further problems of roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.626" offset="15145880">The petition was granted, he's -- the court said so in unequivocal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.310" offset="15168658">It is hard to say at this time that this was not understood, but I would go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.210" offset="15200214">After this, the Court addressed itself directly to the petitioner and explained in other words what was going on that he'd been granted immunity that he no longer need claim his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.946" offset="15279208">In this connection, as to what he was asked to respond to, I think it's important to look directly at the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.596" offset="15329782">On page 16, the -- the court says partway down after paragraph -- telling him that it's no longer necessary to claim the Fifth Amendment closes with this.</text>
