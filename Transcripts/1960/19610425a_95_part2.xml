            <text syncTime="77.819" offset="414699">He, however, did admit in this statement that at sometime he had previously threatened his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.443" offset="449181">A subsequent conversation was held with the petitioner by three other officers and the questioning lasted until about 5 a.m. when petitioner went to his cell to sleep.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.139" offset="511979">At noon on August the 4th after the police had located the gun and holster on the petitioner's premises, they returned to the jail and confronted him with these articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.522" offset="569448">They made no threats or promises to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.786" offset="578539">And on the contrary when petitioners saw him with these articles, he stated, "I heard you had located the gun."</text>
            <text syncTime="125.398" offset="604975">He then changed his story to the officers, admitted that his first story was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.211" offset="632247">He admitted then that he had been in Gridley on the night in question that the gun had gone off as a result of a struggle with his wife for this gun but he's dead at that time that she was in possession of the gun and when she was lying in the ground after having been shot, he took the gun and drove back to Palermo where he buried the gun and concealed the holster.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.637" offset="8689873">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.529" offset="8701471">My worthy opponent and I are agreed on the issues here before this Court and they need not to further be discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.840" offset="8726758">It resolves itself into perhaps a rather simple, factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.090" offset="8747760">However, I do wish to apologize for the statement I made this morning to secure from colleague as to the time of arraignment with regard to the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.336" offset="8784750">I don't wish to get involved in this arraignment thing again but counsel and I were thinking of arraignment in the Superior Court and that would explain the wrong -- factually incorrect statement I made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.676" offset="8850056">I think it begs the question to say that there is no affirmative act by the police to show him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.109" offset="8883806">It's true they have no duty to provide a man with a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.932" offset="8899062">An indigent is afforded a lawyer by the courts of California in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.203" offset="8916198">However, we do maintain that if a man in police custody, unable accepting with the indulgence of the police to contact counsel, asks to do so, then this is his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.278" offset="8988505">I have rather briefly reviewed the record being at the same disadvantage as Mrs.Maier and I having been at the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.780" offset="9026539">However, I don't find that record so clearly shows that this matter regarding counsel in actually a statement to Travers, the tape recorded statement appearing at page 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.568" offset="9081605">Travers says, the question, “Well, that's about all I can there, when you get your attorney.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.530" offset="9105533">I don't know who your attorney is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.886" offset="9110967">What was that fellow's name?</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.817" offset="9118595">Answer, “I was trying to get (Inaudible) as it appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.241" offset="9132387">(Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.567" offset="9153599">"Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.505" offset="9141373">San Jose."</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.094" offset="9147747">San Jose is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.400" offset="9156942">And then Travers says, “There is nothing we can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.031" offset="9167496">All we can do is what your request to the company, going back again to the question of insurance."</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.089" offset="9191737">Then at the section with which Mrs. Maier referred to regarding the testimony of the -- I take it this is -- yes, this is the defendant's brother's testimony at page 354 and 355.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.714" offset="9250252">We are handicapped here by again the limited education of both defendant and his brother because the question was put to him, to the brother on cross examination by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.314" offset="9300616">"You have been in this particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.897" offset="9306990">Has been associated with your brother trying to help him out in your defense have you not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.971" offset="9323290">Answer, “In his defense, I just sat and heard it the same as anybody else.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.628" offset="9341889">Question, "Well, you have conferred with him at various times over in the jail working out matters of his defense, didn't you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.634" offset="9365922">Answer, “Well, I just conceded for his lawyer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.990" offset="9379297">Now, I submitted, he probably -- I would assume he meant but still the time of this intercession does not appear from the statement although the brother goes on to testify, “Yes, we discussed about my other brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.131" offset="9435930">We talked about that a whole lot down in the jail."</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.784" offset="9482533">Oh yes, the question was asked this morning as to the reference, in the record to actually request for counsel and that appears as is mentioned in our opening brief at page -- in the record, pages 382 and 436.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.981" offset="9571244">I think the later statement -- the statement made to police officers, after the statement made to Travers actually is a bit beyond the orbit of the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.670" offset="9630072">Attention should be focused it seems to me on this one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.853" offset="9650761">Did actually, at any time before his interview with Travers tells the story that he then told and the answer is that he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.658" offset="9694020">This was the first time that he had admitted coming in -- coming to the scene in possession of the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.614" offset="9733831">The affect of the -- this whole tape being played to the jury heard by their ears, I think cannot be minimized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.933" offset="9779075">If nothing else but for this tape which we still perfectly maintain was the result of coercion in a manner argued this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.449" offset="9817213">If defendant had not been acquitted outright, there is a reasonable possibility I think that he would have received a lesser penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.252" offset="9852426">California as so many other States has varying degree of homicide and but for the damning tape confession, it -- I think cannot be said be on certainty that he might not have been found guilty of manslaughter or of second degree murder or indeed if he were still found guilty of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.135" offset="9927868">But for the fact that this tape having been played, it will might be that the jury would have brought in a recommendation with leniency as in this case, they did not do it.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="2465.769" offset="9966425">Mr. Travers, I will -- and I -- I corrected and my recollection that some place in the record, it's stated that the petitioner's counsel argued to the jury that if this statement to Travers had not been put in by the prosecution, he would've put it in himself?</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.550" offset="10081573">Our contention is that he has no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.283" offset="10092544">That this was just a matter of defense strategy, virtually imposed upon him by the methods of the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.839" offset="10118771">And I would like to further point out because there maybe some further confusions in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.036" offset="10139564">The record will show that as the arraignment in the Superior Court, the defendant was represented by Mr. King, however, that is not this Mr. King.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.889" offset="10178957">Mr. Joseph R. King represented him at the time of the trial, Mr. Albert King, my associate's brother is the one mentioned at the Superior Court arraignment.</text>
