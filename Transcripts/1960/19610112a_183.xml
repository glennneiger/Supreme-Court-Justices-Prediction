            <text syncTime="16.559" offset="169566">Mr. Blanchard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles F. Blanchard</label>
            <text syncTime="27.142" offset="211989">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.799" offset="226617">This action was brought in the North Carolina State Court by the railroad employee, Maynard against his employer, the Durham Southern Railway Company under the provisions of the Federal Employer's Liability Act, growing out of injuries which he received on August 22nd, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.120" offset="311881">The case came on for trail in the Wake County Superior Court in April 1959, the Superior Court being North Carolina's (Inaudible) highest court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.925" offset="363081">Railroad's motion of a nonsuit was granted at the end of all of the evidence, without the juries having the opportunity of passing on any of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.510" offset="409370">The Supreme Court on appeal, affirmed the Superior Court with one justice dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.189" offset="444165">Thereafter this -- the United States Supreme Court granted the writ on 27 June, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.765" offset="482408">The petitioner was seriously injured while assisting in loading of one of the railroad's motor trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.931" offset="511143">In bar a petitioner's rights, the railroad pleaded and offered evidence of a release signed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.657" offset="553984">Plaintiff or petitioner attacks the validity and did attack the validity below of the purported release on two grounds, one that it was unsupported by any consideration whatsoever and its execution was procured by fraud, misrepresentation and undue influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.189" offset="644159">Now, to please Court, since the railroad conceded in open court in the North Carolina Supreme Court that -- probably the evidence offered by the petitioner, was sufficient to take the case to the jury on the issue of negligence, it would appear unnecessary for me to take the Court's time in reciting the minute details of how the plaintiff's serious injuries occurred during the loading of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.481" offset="769337">With that background, let us consider the evidence most favorable to the petitioner in respect to the execution of the release, itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.969" offset="819284">Following his injury, the petitioner was off his job for approximate two weeks and was required to see several doctors, before he was able to return to work around the middle of September 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.620" offset="873827">Thereafter, on Saturday, September 17, 1955, petitioner went to the office of the defendant railroad's general manager to get his pay check.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.771" offset="926490">The petitioner produced evidence, that on this date the defendant railroad owed him a $144.60 for back wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.676" offset="978108">There were two men in the office, the general manager these being the petitioner and the general manager and no others.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.347" offset="1012799">When the petitioner requested his pay check, the general manager took a piece of paper from the desk drawer and keeping it partially covered with his hand, pushed it across the desk for petitioner and told petitioner to sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.781" offset="1074448">He didn't take his hand off to the paper testified the petitioner, I remember very distinctly that Mr. McAllister kept his hand on it, he further testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.762" offset="1122408">He also testified that he was not even given a chance to read this paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.855" offset="1154800">Petitioner thought that he was signing for his pay check and so he testified and he testified he ordinarily received his pay check on the Saturday and this being -- this was also Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.444" offset="1209135">He would not have signed the paper had he known it was a release and that he had never been paid anything -- he had never been paid anything for his injuries we -- when he signed what he thought was a receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.906" offset="1286980">Now, the petitioner urges that under this evidence, there were two jury questions, it's properly two jury questions, one, the question of fraud whether it was procured by fraud and second was there complete lack of consideration as alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.045" offset="1371512">In doing so, making these contentions, the petitioner does not rely only on evidentiary or factual propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.635" offset="1417906">We feel that the Supreme Court of North Carolina simply misinterpreted or ignored the vast federal questions and authorities on the subject of releases.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.082" offset="1471718">First, as to fraud, Dice versus Akron, Canton &amp; Youngstown Railroad are considered at this Court in 342 U.S. 1952, seems to be and appears to be the leading case in the last time this Court has considered the question of releases and the -- and the fraud in the procurement of releases under the Federal Employers Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.872" offset="1586866">There, the petitioner alleged that he was owed $900 by the railroad and he went to get his pay check and the railroad told him, he was merely signing a receipt, turned out to be a release from liability for personal injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.216" offset="1732211">Here, in the principal case, we have false and deceptive silence made to deceive and which did deceive.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.435" offset="2129063">We'd say that there does not have to be affirmative fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.491" offset="2149334">There can be fraud by silence and by actions, rather than affirmative, deliberate fraud and in that respect we say, they ignored the federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.113" offset="2199803">They did not consider for instance, the Purvis versus Pennsylvania case, decided by the Third Circuit, the same year as Dice, but following Dice and it is based on Dice.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.141" offset="2255914">We feel in that case the further -- the Purvis case the facts are as close to being on all force as this case as any case can be.</text>

            <text syncTime="831.437" offset="3429125">I like to say first, there is nothing in the record to suggest that North Carolina Supreme Court did not rule in accordance with the applicable federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.269" offset="3472488">It was stipulated in the trial court and the record will show that the case was to be decided by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.260" offset="3504462">The Supreme Court of North Carolina recognized that the case should be decided by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.809" offset="3526614">It recognized the problem before it, because it says, “The only question to be determined is whether or not the issue fraud and lack of consideration should go to jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="866.945" offset="3571127">So what I am here doing now, is arguing a nonsuit motion, because there is no law in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.838" offset="3598712">There is no law that I know of that the petitioner cited that I am in fundamental disagreement with.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.793" offset="3630582">Now, he raised two questions in his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.451" offset="3645210">He cited the same two questions in his brief, but he did not as such, discussed the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.625" offset="3673840">He raised five points and discussed five points.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.294" offset="3688573">I would like to mark -- remark briefly on each of the five points.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.785" offset="3702471">His first point, was federal not state law prevails is conceded here, is conceded in the trial court, it was conceded in the Supreme of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.029" offset="3747506">His second point was defendant concedes evidence sufficient to take the case to the jury had the plaintiff not signed the so-called release.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.076" offset="3783659">In the Supreme Court of North Carolina, my statement was the evidence was properly sufficient to go to the jury on negligence, had not the release existed, but if you will read this evidence, there is not enough evidence of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.334" offset="3852727">There is not enough evidence of injury to support a jury verdict for negligence and damages, but that question was not before the Supreme Court, it is not before this Court, but it does have some bearing on the entire picture of this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.028" offset="5603453">It states on here that I would probably have no disability, that none were expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.667" offset="5622053">I didn't expect much disability at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.659" offset="5633964">I didn't know how bad my disability was at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.816" offset="5646608">I didn't expect any permanent disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.614" offset="5657788">I just thought it was a mild back sprain and that I would get over in a few weeks or a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.931" offset="5675133">When, I signed it with the answer to the problem of disability, "I mean it at that time," that was just a few days before the release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.751" offset="5710346">At the time I filled out that accident report, I had no idea I would ever get the lawsuit back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.120" offset="5735842">Now, just a few days later, he signs a release, an evidence concerning that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.904" offset="5759039">Now -- now, the evidence shows that this accident report which was signed in Apex, North Carolina where he says, no disability, everything was held properly, were set to McAllister in Durham, North Carolina, a few days before the petitioner went to Durham and signed this release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.829" offset="5818702">The evidence is that McAllister knew nothing about the accident, nothing about the facts, except what was set forth in that accident report signed by Maynard which he says, “When I signed it, I didn't think I'll be hurting.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.985" offset="5867290">So, on page 31, we were talking about the day he signed the release, I do not know what I -- I did not know what I'm signing that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.827" offset="5902712">I did not have any curiosity about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.448" offset="5913161">I thought I was just signing for my check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.685" offset="5922147">I just assumed that's what I was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.522" offset="5933432">It was at a different place from where I usually signed for my check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.305" offset="5948583">I haven't -- then he goes back to personnel injury report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.595" offset="5961749">I admit signing the personnel injury report, but I don't remember when or what time to sign, I couldn't say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.890" offset="5986931">If I knew what the personnel injury report was at the time signed it, but I'd usually don't sign papers not knowing what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.259" offset="6012426">Now, we get back to the release, this fellow, they say was used duress and fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.279" offset="6036459">Mr. McAllister didn't tell me anything about it, he didn't tell me a story about it, all he did was ask me how or was on that particular day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.330" offset="6068642">I don't know how -- I didn't know how long in the future, I still thought it was temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.514" offset="6089435">What was there from Mr. McAllister to defraud him about?</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.339" offset="6104691">Mr. McAllister didn't know the things that what he put on the -- on the accident report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.993" offset="6123395">And -- and certainly, if the plaintiff himself thought it was temporary, there was nothing for under defraud and there was nothing for McAllister to make a -- misrepresentation about at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.443" offset="6165191">That could have been a mutual mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.084" offset="6171669">We're not here on mutual mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.565" offset="6181595">At that time I didn't know what it was -- that I was signing or wouldn't sign it, he did testify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.713" offset="6206255">At that time Mr. McAllister didn't know what disability might be in the future from my injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.658" offset="6229974">He didn't make any false misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.465" offset="6241259">The only thing he did do there, he just didn't explain the paper to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.208" offset="6260172">He didn't make any deceitful suggestions to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.026" offset="6271457">He didn't make any fraudulent suggestions to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.746" offset="6282324">He just put the paper down there and I signed it and got my check and left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.268" offset="6300400">I didn't think I was going to be pertinent in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.680" offset="6318059">What was there to misrepresent this man who was an apprentice foreman, who would had been on the railroad for 9 or 10 or 11 years, who the record shows, talked to his union representative before he filed the accident report and knew all their in his negotiations went through his labor representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.834" offset="6386709">The trial judge heard the evidence, he nonsuited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.723" offset="6398307">The Supreme Court of North Carolina fully and fairly recognized each and every question presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.234" offset="6436342">And I state that there was only one question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.813" offset="6458598">And my question was this, the question for determination is whether or not, the plaintiff's evidence, in supporting his -- allegations that the release was without consideration and rather procured by means of fraud and duress was sufficient the warrant its submission to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.310" offset="6520560">I quoted the only question before this Court from page 55 of the record which is a quote from the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.975" offset="6551280">Now, what the Supreme Court, it recognized both of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.820" offset="6562670">There is no evidence in the record before us to support the contention of plaintiff that he was entitled as a matter of right to the $144.60 as wages for the time he did not work because of his alleged injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.644" offset="6617945">Therefore, unless the release was procured by fraud and duress as alleged in plaintiff's reply to the appropriate matter pleading in defendants answer, the judgement of nonsuit entered in the court below must be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.105" offset="6667786">As the Supreme Court of North Carolina construes the evidence, he does not show any fraud or duress on the part of defendant or its agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.025" offset="6703522">But on the contrary, his own testimony negates his allegations in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.472" offset="6725256">In our opinion the plaintiff and defendant entered into the release in good faith, neither party at time of the execution of the release, had any idea to the plaintiff has sustained an injury that might or would develop into any permanent disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.740" offset="6782307">There are may have been mutual mistake on the part of plaintiff and the defendant in this respect as was alleged and relied on in Cohen versus Pennsylvania Railroad, supra.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.726" offset="6818252">However, in instant case, the plaintiff's cause of action is not about a mere mistake, but on fraud and duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.937" offset="6843120">In the light of the record before us in the applicable decisions bearing thereon, we are constrained to hold that the ruling of the court below must be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.591" offset="6881782">So that's the reason I say, “We're here arguing a motion of nonsuit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.099" offset="6895783">The record gets smaller and smaller, as it comes up in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.233" offset="6912293">But the truth came out at the trial we call the cow, mule, but it was still a cow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.269" offset="6928488">He referred it as labor, he referred to his wages, but the record and the plaintiff's evidence shows that it was a small consideration, it was a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.845" offset="6966732">They have not based his answer on -- insignificant consideration or mutual mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.571" offset="6989615">They based their action on a very vicious reply alleging all types of fraud and duress were at the time and I repeat, there was nothing for McAllister in this representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.500" offset="7169337">There our main witness, Mr. McAllister, never testified that the man was not due $144.60 for labor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.751" offset="7278425">So you would think that if a -- they -- are we really going to make a lot about this $144.60 not being used to the petitioner, they would put on some evidence themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.725" offset="7334222">Now, in respect to our own witness, what he had to say about the policy of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.073" offset="7367659">I want to say first this that there is no evidence that the petitioner ever knew about any so-called policy or that this witness ever informed the petitioner about this so-called policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.230" offset="7420322">All that that witness which has been referred to and testified to him, was that -- was on page 34 as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.202" offset="7464208">I know that the policy of the company that -- was that, when anyone had been off and had come back to work, they did not get their wages unless they sign the release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.184" offset="7508093">I knew that -- I knew that was the policy of the Durham &amp; Southern Railway Company, ever since I have known anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.724" offset="7542262">That is, you don't get your wages when you have been off from work, unless you sign a release, didn't say anything about injuries there, but then it goes down to next paragraph as so, likewise if a man is injured he is called upon to sign a release when he gets his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.364" offset="7636825">Never -- this witness which they tried to establish the policy of that, never said that this release is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.414" offset="7681024">He uses the word, is called upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.475" offset="7693249">That I think is synonymous with asked to sign a release, but even that witness which they may so much to do about, never said that it was necessary to sign a release before getting his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.295" offset="7764511">And finally, we say that the North Carolina Supreme Court never considered the subject of lack of consideration -- of -- of total lack of consideration.</text>
