            <label>Mr. Allen S. Stim</label>
            <text syncTime="27.753" offset="214392">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.575" offset="229648">This case comes before this Court on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which affirmed a judgment dated and entered in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dated the 2nd day of February, 1959 by which this petitioner was adjudged guilty of a contempt of court for his refusal to testify as ordered pursuant to the provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1406 which is known under the popular name as the Immunity Act -- as the immunity provision of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.285" offset="392547">In this argument, I shall use both the code name and the popular name -- name interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.202" offset="424208">By the terms of this judgment, adjudging the petitioner in contempt of court, he was sentenced to a term of two years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.285" offset="456495">This term of imprisonment that commenced at the termination of a narrowly, a five-year federal sentence that this petitioner was then serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.549" offset="489618">This judgment, by its terms, provided that the petitioner might purge himself within a period of 60 days from the date of the judgment and in that event that this sentence, by its -- its terms would be -- be vacated and become null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.754" offset="554402">This 60-day purge period has elapsed without the petitioner having availed himself to its provisions and the judgment by its terms had become final.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.650" offset="594004">I would like to state that the petitioner is presently freed -- free on $10,000 bails -- bail -- dollars bail, allowed by one of the Justices of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.591" offset="633710">The questions being raised on this writ of certiorari are four questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.112" offset="655862">They are first, does the immunity provision of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956 grant immunity from state prosecutions for violations of state narcotic laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="149.402" offset="701001">And in the event that this Court holds that this federal statute does not grant such an immunity, the question is, is the immunity granted by the federal statute coextensive with the constitutional privilege against self -- self-incrimination which it seeks to replace?</text>
            <text syncTime="166.254" offset="768397">The second part of this question calls for reexamination by this Court of the 1931 decision of United States against Murdock, cited 284 U.S. 141, with my contention that the Murdock case should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.720" offset="838301">My second question raised is that on the facts of this particular proceeding, before the petitioner could be validly held in contempt for refusal to testify as ordered pursuant to the immunity provision of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, was it incumbent -- was it not incumbent upon the Government to have made -- tendered this petitioner before he testified a firm offer or commitment on the part of the Government to render inoperative, the unexecuted portions of an earlier judgment of conviction entered in the United States District -- District Court which adjudged this petitioner guilty of the crime of conspiracy to violate the narcotic laws of the United States and under the terms of which judgment, the petitioner was then serving and as yet, unexpired five-year prison sentence and owed the Government a $10,000 fine which he has been unable to pay which were imposed pursuant to the terms of the earlier judgment of conviction when the said prior judgment of conviction for conspiracy to violate the narcotic laws of the United States, was based upon the same facts that the Government sought to question this petitioner about before a grand jury in the present proceeding pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1406?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.178" offset="1160129">My third question which relates to question number one, point 1 is, was this petitioner denied due process of law by the failure of the District Court to inform him as to the scope and extent of the immunity granted pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1406 before it adjudged the petitioner to be in contempt of court for his failure to testify pursuant to said provisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.164" offset="1263992">Well, my fourth and final question is on the facts of this case, was the sentence of this petitioner to a five-year prison term on this present contempt proceeding -- to a two-year prison term, I mean, which sentence was to commence at the termination of the earlier five-year sentence that petitioner was then serving an abuse of discretion that will be reviewed by this Court -- by this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="314.938" offset="1363153">I believe that at this point, a statement of facts is in order.</text>

            <text syncTime="685.356" offset="2844818">On this hearing, the petitioner opposed the Government's motion on two different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.234" offset="2868328">The first ground being that Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1406 is in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States and that it does not provide the broad immunity contemplated by said two amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.268" offset="2932485">I believe this appears in transcript record -- pages 20 and 21 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.026" offset="2955473">The petitioner's then counsel argued that there is nothing to indicate in the immunity statute, the scope and the extent of the immunity jurisdiction of the immunity grant and jurisdictions other than the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.170" offset="3020048">And more particularly, he referred to the state jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.265" offset="3036453">The petitioner's then counsel cited this statute as an example of the constant attempts to chip away the basic liberties guaranteed under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.123" offset="3079816">The petitioner's second ground which is not being urged before this Court is that certain questions propounded to the petitioner before the grand jury were not within the context of the meaning of the statute as enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.446" offset="3129135">As I've stated, I'm not urging the -- the second point before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.027" offset="3151496">Thereafter and on the 2nd day of December -- of February, 1959, the District Court rendered an opinion -- an opinion and judgment, adjudging the petitioner to be in contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.770" offset="3206457">I believe that the opinion was rendered on January 29th, 1959 and that there was some question before the Court whether they had entered a judgment or not, therefore, the judgments was entered, I believe, the Monday -- Monday but both the opinion and judgment are considered to go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.949" offset="3287124">This opinion which is officially cited in Giacomo Reina, 170 F. Supp.292, appears on pages 29 through 34 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.165" offset="3328084">In this opinion, Judge Dawson followed the rationale of this -- the decision of this Court in United States against Murdock and held that he was bound by the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.203" offset="3372178">The judgment of the District Court was unanimously affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on December 30th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.219" offset="3416273">This affirmance appears in the transcript, pages 38 through 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.977" offset="3435290">It's officially recorded as Giacomo Reina against the United States, 273 F.2d 2 -- 234.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.911" offset="3467055">The Court of Appeals likewise followed the Murdock decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.414" offset="3485027">This brings me to my first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.769" offset="3494431">In answer to the first question raised and to set forth in point 1 of my brief, my contention is that the Narcotic Control Act of 1956 does not grant immunity from state prosecutions for narcotic violations of state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.511" offset="3561409">And that therefore, the immunity provision of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956 is not coextensive with the constitutional privilege that it seeks to replace, that is the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.857" offset="3626820">The petitioner contends that despite the wording in the Act which uses the language, "Nor shall testimony so compelled be used as evidence in any criminal proceeding against him in any court, that said statute, cannot by its terms under a grant of immunity, bar States from prosecuting for violations of state penal laws involving narcotics which are -- and exercised by the States of their police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.822" offset="3734653">As any such attempt by Congress to grant such an immunity from state prosecutions, would be an invasion of the powers expressly reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment."</text>
            <text syncTime="918.502" offset="3777390">This fact was recognized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Tedesco against the United States, 255 F.2d 35, which cases cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.697" offset="3826186">In the Tedesco case, the Sixth Circuit, while affirming a contempt conviction arising under this very same statute, went on to state on the ground that it felt bound by the Murdock decision, the Sixth Circuit went on to express grave doubt that Congress has the power to grant immunity from prosecutions in state courts pursuant to state narcotic laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allen S. Stim</label>
            <text syncTime="1150.776" offset="4706513">Well, my question is at the time that the -- the Ullmann statute, the Immunity Act of 1954 was enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.465" offset="4753220">The reading of the congressional reports shows that apparently, Congress didn't have too much of an intent one way or the other, their intent being that if we could get state immunity well and dandy, we'll leave that up to the Supreme Court of the United States to construe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.160" offset="4824064">That appears in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.799" offset="4838588">Congress, in enacting federal immunity legislation, has recognized the powers involved and the questions of constitutionality that would arise out of a federal -- federal immunity legislation that might be construed as barring state prosections for violations of state penal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.177" offset="4908074">This point, I came to the part of my arguments where I dealt with the congressional intent in the Ullmann statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.062" offset="4935659">He has report on the bill that was subsequently enacted into law and is now known as the Immunity Act of 1954 that is 18 U.S.C., Section 3486 Supp.2, as reported in two congressional codes and Congress reports, 83rd Congress, Second Session, 1954 on pages 3063 and following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.405" offset="5024998">This majority -- the majority report which recommended passage of the then proposed bill, expressed great doubt as to the power of Congress under the proposed grant of immunity which referred to compel testimony in matters concerning national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.699" offset="5090200">This majority report expressed great doubt in that field of the power of Congress to bar subsequent action in -- in the States in enforcing their criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.010" offset="5131368">However, this majority report recommended passage of the then proposed bill leaving the question as scope and extent of the immunity granted and constitutionality of the Act up to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.900" offset="5182986">The House Minority Report, which appears in page 3071 of the aforementioned code in congressional reports, considered that the proposed Act construed to grant immunity from state prosecutions, was an unwarranted intrusion by the Federal Government into state prosecutions which must therefore fail to lack of broadness, consonant with the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.359" offset="5276818">This Immunity Act, as I have already stated, served as the model for the drafting of the present statute under discussion, which was enacted approximately two years later and approximately three months after the Immunity Act of 1954 was construed as constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.843" offset="5350693">In Ullmann against the United States, he was -- 350 -- 350 U.S. 422.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.663" offset="5382040">The Immunity Act of 1954, however, concerned investigations relating to the interference with or endangering of the national security or defense of the United States and its subject matter is readily -- readily distinguishable from the subject matter of this Act, which by its terms, involves investigations into violations of the narcotic laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.580" offset="5481723">In Ullmann against the United States, the constitutionality of the Immunity Act of 1954 was upheld and the phrase in any court contained in that Act and in the present -- contained in the Ullmann act, was construed as granting immunity from both federal and state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.202" offset="5560195">As I've stated before, the same language is used in the present Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.862" offset="5574823">The Ullmann case, however, turned upon a paramount power or authority of Congress to safeguard the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.627" offset="5605857">This power is closely related to the war power, both of which powers under the Constitution, delegate the authority solely in Congress or the Federal Government, its own responsibility to preserve the continued existence of a free and independent United States and its constituent States without any bar, delay or hindrance on the part of the respective States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.337" offset="5700733">While not mentioned in the Ullmann decision, this paramount power of the Federal Government and this field is, I believe, underscored by Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 of the Constitution, which is an interdiction on the States from engaging in war without the consent of Congress, unless actually invaded or in such eminent danger as will not admit of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.680" offset="5790072">On this argument, for the first time, the Justice Department has taken the position that is in point 1 of their brief that Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1406 grants immunity from both state as well as federal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.297" offset="5852557">All of the prior cases involving violations of this statute with the possible exception of the Tedesco case, which I've previously cited, studiously avoid discussion as to the scope or extent of the immunity granted referring to rely solely on the decision of this Court in Murdock against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.736" offset="5930297">And as I've stated, the Government likewise below in the lower courts in applying this statute, followed the same position as the courts did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.335" offset="5964675">The position now being taken by the Justice Department on -- on this appeal that immunity is also granted from state prosecution is merely an attempt by the Justice Department to extend the doctrine of Ullmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.529" offset="6025488">The Government confers on page 20 of its brief that in every case where Congress is acting in the exercise of federal power which in the present case involves taxation and the control of the importation of narcotics, that in such cases, Congress has the power to impose restrictions but it bar the States from exercising the powers reserved to them under the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution by -- by means of statutory enactment such as the present Act now under discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.494" offset="6149308">In support of this contention, the cases of Ullmann against the United States and Adams against Maryland are cited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.243" offset="9424332">My -- as I stated, the second part of that -- my -- my first point is that the immunity provision of the narcotic -- if this Court holds that the immunity provision of the Narcotic Control Act grants immunity from federal prosecution only and does not grant immunity from prosecution by the States for violations of state laws, and I believe that this is the only logical construction consistent with the Constitution, that in this event, that this Court should overrule its earlier decision in United States against Murdock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.858" offset="9566856">The case relied on by the courts below and adjudging this petitioner to be in contempt of court for refusal to testify pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1406.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.101" offset="9615757">The Murdock case decided by this Court in 1931 did not involve an immunity statute but involved a prosecution of the taxpayer, Murdock, for his refusal to testimony -- to give testimony and to supply information for the Bureau of Internal Revenue for deductions claimed in his 1927 or 1928 federal income tax returns, for moneys allegedly paid to other persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.308" offset="9720560">This was an indictable misdemeanor under the then Title 26 of the United States Code, Section 1265 and 1114.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.478" offset="9757236">Murdock interposed a special plea to this indictment that if the questions he answered -- that -- that he answered the various questions propounded to him before the Bureau of Internal Revenue that he would've been compelled to become a witness against himself and caused to be subject to prosecution for violations of various laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.069" offset="9843649">The fact was that at the time Murdock invoked his privilege against self-incrimination before the Bureau of Internal Revenue, his counsel stated that Murdock had in mind violations of the state law, not of the federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.081" offset="9895685">This Court, in 284 U.S. 141, set aside the special plea holding that investigations for federal purposes may not be prevented by matters dependent on state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.492" offset="9945318">This holding was construed by this Court the second time Murdock came before it, 290 U.S. 389, as definitely settling for the first time the proposition of law that one under examination in a federal tribunal may not refuse to answer on account of probable incrimination under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.031" offset="10023476">The Murdock case, as Your Honors are well aware, has been severely criticized as being an erroneous interpretation of the English common law as being inconsistent with prior decisions of this Court and as being destructive of the privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.145" offset="10115950">I agree with these criticisms and in my opinion, the Murdock case was an unfortunate decision in the field of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.525" offset="10149491">In the Murdock case, this Court adopted what it called the English rule that the common law of privilege exempting witnesses from answering questions that would tend to incriminate them does not protect them against disclosing offenses and violation of the laws of the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.262" offset="10216469">As I have set forth in point 1 (b) of my brief, first, there is no such English rule as was enunciated by this Court in Murdock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.978" offset="10247293">And secondly, in this country, the respective States which had domestic jurisdictions within the -- within the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the United States, do not quite fit the term in other country as was used in the English cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.804" offset="10322631">Two English cases that were cited in Murdock are Two Sicilies against Willcox and Regina against Boyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.225" offset="10364322">These cases are cited and discussed on pages 21 and 22 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.847" offset="10386787">And to take some mere reading of them to show that they do not stand for any such rule of law set forth in Murdock, Two Sicilies, which was decided in the year 1850, involved -- involved the claim of privilege in both by a witness at a trial and a discovery proceeding in an English court where the witnesses, who were agents of a revolutionary government in Sicily, claimed before the English court that if they were required to testify that their answers might subject them to the penal laws of Sicily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.196" offset="10512175">The English court rejected this claim of privilege and after first stating its ignorance of Sicilian law and the fact that the English court had enough of a problem understanding the law of its own jurisdiction without being expected to understand the lower foreign jurisdictions, the court went on to state in that case, in its decision, "It is to be observed that in such a case, in order to make the disclosures dangerous to the party who objects, it is essential that he should first quit the protection of our laws and willfully go within the jurisdiction of the laws he has violated."</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.238" offset="10652296">I don't think it takes any extended discussion to differentiate the Two Sicilies case from the problem that this petitioner faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.273" offset="10688449">The other English case cited, Regina against Boyes states what I consider as the correct rule as to the extent of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.619" offset="10725857">Regina against Boyes, decided in 1861, involved a claim of privilege invoked by a witness at a trial and at a -- an election bribery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.737" offset="10770369">Despite the fact that at the trial, the witness was offered and he accepted a pardon, a royal pardon under the great seal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.950" offset="10803179">Despite the offer and acceptance of the pardon, this witness persisted in his claim of privilege stating that despite the pardon, he was still subject to possible impeachment by commons which was not covered by the pardon and that therefore, he should be entitled to invoke his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.117" offset="10879875">King's Bench, in ruling against the claim of privilege stated, and I quote, "Further than this, we are of the opinion that the danger to be apprehended must be real and appreciable with reference to the ordinary operation of law in the ordinary course of things, not a danger of an imaginary and unsubstantial character having reference to some extraordinary and fairly possible contingency so improbable that no reasonable man would separate to influence his conduct."</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.899" offset="11011009">The court further stated, "But it would be to convert to a salutary protection into a means of abuse if it would be held that a mere imaginary possibility of danger, however remote and improbable, was sufficient to justify the withholding of evidence essential to ends of justice."</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.416" offset="11081017">In Regina against Boyes, the Court ruled against the privilege -- claim of privilege stating that the witness's fear of impeachment despite the pardon was in its words, ridiculous and unreasonable as any impeachment of the witness would be contrary to custom and to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.344" offset="11152697">Both of the aforementioned cases and subsequent English cases turn on the question of the danger of the witness, was it real and appreciable?</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.832" offset="11190732">If the fear was unrealistic or imaginary, the claim of privilege was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.890" offset="11210898">If it was recognized by the Court as reasonable or realistic, it was recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.216" offset="11232214">That -- such is the rule of the English cases and has been in the past and still is as amply demonstrated by the cases of East India Company against Campbell, 1 Ves. sen. 267, 27 Eng. Rep. 1010, United States of America against McRae, L.R. 4 Eq. 327, decided in 1867 and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, L. R. Ch. 79 in the year 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.333" offset="11352691">The United States of America against McRae, which was an English case, decided subsequent to the decisions in Two Sicilies against Willcox and Regina against Boyes, the claim of privilege or the privilege against self-incrimination was recognized by the English court despite the fact that the fines, forfeitures and penalties were under the laws of the United States, a jurisdiction far into that of the English court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.696" offset="11454151">This law -- that this rule is still the law of England and the test being that whether the danger was real and appreciable, I referred the Court to Ex parte Reynolds, 20 Ch. D. 294, where the rule was reaffirmed and restated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.211" offset="11524263">The Murdock case cited as further authority for its holding, prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.647" offset="11545997">These prior decisions are cited in Murdock, has authority to sustain the proposition set forth in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.808" offset="11578598">The case of Counselman against Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 4 -- 547, which is an old standby and is now one book law and decided both pro and con in all -- in all litigation involving the construction of immunity legislation, does not stand for any such proposition as enunciated in Murdock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.198" offset="11668146">In that case which involved the constitutionality of the old Interstate Commerce Act with regard to its provision for the compulsion of testimony, no question was raised as the applicability of the Act to state jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.381" offset="11724884">The Court, in that landmark decision, only stated what has now become the established rule that a statue which leaves a party or witness subject to prosecution after he answers the criminating questions put to him and that's the plan, the privilege conferred by the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.056" offset="11799594">The other cases cited in United States against Murdock, which touched on the issue involved, likewise apply the test of whether or not the danger to the witness was real and -- and appreciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.827" offset="11854660">Brown against Walker, 161 U.S. 591, the case cited in United States against Murdock and it successors, had the original authority for the Murdock rule, dealt with the amended Interstate Commerce Act toward the Act of February 11th, 1893 which was the successor to the Act struck down by this Court in Counselman against Hitchcock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.838" offset="11946715">The Act of February 11th, 1893 substantially provided as follows."</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.449" offset="11969181">That no person shall be subject to penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction matter or thing concerning which he might testify in obedience to a subpoena or order."</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.391" offset="12020903">This provision was held by the majority opinion of the Court in Brown against Walker, which was a 5-to-4 decision, as being that the criminality was removed by statute that the immunity granted was coextensive with the privilege that it sought to replace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.026" offset="12087463">Well, this majority opinion inferred that the immunity granted in the federal act was operative also in the state jurisdictions for crimes committed in those jurisdictions under the supreme law of the land clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.971" offset="12143261">A careful reading of this majority opinion, discloses that the majority of the justices deciding that case went on the test set forth by the old English cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.635" offset="12189863">The test of the reality or the danger of be -- of the -- to the witness being real and appreciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.787" offset="12238555">The minority opinion in that case by Mr. Justice Shiras did not consider the possibility of state prosecution as being a fear unsubstantial and remote and held that the statute was thus in conflict with the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.799" offset="12306578">This minority opinion also asserted that as Congress cannot create state courts nor denounce penalties for crimes or offenses against the States, so it cannot proscribe rules for proceedings in state courts and that therefore, the Act in question could not apply to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.021" offset="12383483">In Hale against Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, which involved the proceeding under the Sherman Antitrust Act and likewise involved an immunity statute, this Court disposed of the witness' claim in that case of probable incrimination under state law as being -- following the language of the English cases as being to one substantial and remote to impair legal immunity, citing Brown against Walker and Jack against Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.976" offset="12495287">Jack against Kansas, which involved the converse of the present case, a refusal of the witness to testify pursuant to a state immunity statute on the claim that the statute which involved the fixing of coal prices might -- did not confer immunity from state -- from federal prosecution and therefore, violated his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.124" offset="12615868">In that case, this Court while stating that it thought that legal immunity is in regard to prosecutions in the same jurisdiction where the immunity is granted suffices, the Court based its decision on -- in that case on the fact that it considered the alleged fear of the witness of federal prosecution under the federal antitrust act as being too unsubstantial and remote to seriously consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.578" offset="12721716">As proof -- as proof that this Court used the test of reasonableness or reality of the witness's apprehension of prosecution in the aforementioned case -- cases, I cite Bollman against Fagan, which was decided by this Court and by the same bench that decided the previous cases of Jack against Kansas and Hale against Henkel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.365" offset="12804786">In Bollman against Fagan, which did not involve an immunity statute, the witness on being summoned before a federal grand jury, pursuant to an investigation I understand as the criminal liability of an employee in a national bank where certain funds were missing, the witness on being summoned to appear before the grand jury pursuant to subpoena to produce certain records, invoked the Fifth Amendment before said grand jury using the following language."</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.087" offset="12923695">I decline to answer the questions contained in the said order of April 8th, 1905 on the ground that it might tend to criminate me and in this connection, I produced a copy of a petition filed against me and others by a manual up in (Inaudible) in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.294" offset="12996524">And I state that there are many other actions of the same kind pending against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.647" offset="13013974">This petition referred to by the witness Bollman charged him and others with a scheme of gambling known as bucket shop in Ohio, which was criminal conduct in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.483" offset="13061308">In Bollman against Fagan, this Court, in citing the earlier opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in 1820, in United States versus Saline Bank wherein the -- this Court at that time, held that the privilege against self-incrimination exonerated from disclosing offenses in violation of the law -- state law of this -- law of the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.600" offset="13161723">This Court in Bollman against Fagan followed the rationale of Judge Marshall's decision and held that Bollman was exonerated under his claim of privilege from disclosures that would've exposed him to penalties under the state laws and is respectfully submitted that all of the aforementioned decisions of this Court up until Murdock against the United States are consistent and that they apply the rules set forth in the English cases, which apply the test of the danger to the witness being real and appreciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.154" offset="13292022">It was only commencing with Murdock against the United States and it successors, Feldman against the United States and Knapp against Schweitzer, that this Court, in deciding the applicability of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination has abandoned what I considered the tried and true rule of the English cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.722" offset="13370284">That this petitioner would face the threat of a probable state prosecution for violations of state narcotic laws for facts adduced before a federal grand jury or to the federal authorities as a fact that this Court can take judicial notice of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.841" offset="13430784">Title 21 of the United States Code, Section 198 which is not cited in my brief, but is cited by the Solicitor General on page 26 of his brief, provides that federal authority shall cooperate with the States in the suppression of the abuse of use of narcotics to the extent that the Federal Government shall, and I quote, "Substantially arranged for the exchange of narcotic information for the use of said information in prosecutions in federal and state courts."</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.505" offset="13549380">I should -- as a further example of the firm basis of this petitioner's fear that if he's compelled to give testimony in this proceeding that the testimony will be used against him in a -- by the State, I cite the registration of the Mann Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 2424 (b), which provision is also set forth in my opponent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.032" offset="13643525">I cited the Mann Act that the registration provision as being a fact that Congress recognized its limited authority in fields which are strictly as violations of the law under the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.974" offset="13695248">My opponent, the Solicitor General, on page 27 of his brief, Footnote 10, cites this Act as showing a congressional intent to make such harboring as mentioned in the Act, practically impossible by making the federal registrations available to state authorities, the use in state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.927" offset="13775078">It is only reasonable to believe that the -- that a similar intent is behind the enactment and application of the statute now under discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.415" offset="13805066">I have also cited that conflict between the States that follow the Michigan rule and -- and this Court in the Murdock decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.388" offset="13840906">I likewise cited various decisions of the lower court such as Marcello against the United States, United States against DeCarlo and the like, which decisions, although came lip service to Murdock, ignore it in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.576" offset="13909661">I respectfully submit that the judgments -- that the judgment of conviction should be reversed with directions to the lower court that the Government's motion to punish for contempt should be denied.</text>

          <turn speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="3472.288" stopTime="3798.137">
            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="3472.288" offset="13992521">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.188" offset="14004120">Turning first to the question of the 60-day purge period, I would like to say first that we do construe that provision of the judgment as running not only from the day of the District Court's judgment but from the day of an affirmance by this Court, if this Court should affirm and the return of the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.212" offset="14092204">And the reason why we construe the purge period that way, is the District Court explicitly said, it's on page 34 of the record, that the reason he put in a purge period was that he thought that the petitioner might be raising this issue of law and order to get a decision and he thought it was fair for the petitioner to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.288" offset="14168482">And we think it's consonant with that understanding that the petitioner should have the right to exhaust his appellate remedies through the Court of Appeals and this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.775" offset="14206516">Also, we think that the same purge appear -- period provision should be construed in the light of Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which say that when a case comes back from this Court, after the affirmance of a -- of a conviction within 60 days, that's the period, the petitioner, the -- the defendant can go before the District Judge and ask for a reduction or change in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.475" offset="14313305">And so that is why, Mr. Justice Black, we ask for the affirmance of the conviction because we construe the purge period as not having elapsed, this counsel said, but is going in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.272" offset="14356459">But I would also like to bring this to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.271" offset="14368475">If there should be any doubt or if the Court should not feel that its construction adoption of our construction in the opinion should be sufficient and that you want to go further, this is a contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.158" offset="14412048">And in contempt cases, the Court has exerted a power over sentences that it does not have in the ordinary criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.359" offset="14440782">So there would be nothing improper, it would be in accordance with the Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.857" offset="14454784">If it should feel it appropriate, we do not feel it would be necessary but it's open to the Court if it should feel it appropriate to change the purge period of the sentence by providing that the 60-day shall run explicitly from the return of the mandate to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.670" offset="14518000">So there would be no question then that in -- in that -- on that -- when the case goes back to the District Court that the -- that the petitioner will be advised if, as we submit, the Court should hold that the provision -- the immunity provision of the 1956 statute covers both state and federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.306" offset="14600547">At that time, the petitioner will be fully advised and he will have the opportunity to answer the questions under the advice given, most authoritatively, by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.196" offset="14640149">I think, I should also take the opportunity to point out explicitly because there were some intimations to the contrary that we do not read the record as in any way indicating that this petitioner was misled either by the Government or by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.097" offset="14703783">He never asked the trial court to -- to told whether or not this provision covered state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.036" offset="14731473">As counsel very, I think, very deliberately withheld questions of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.733" offset="14750281">The trial court never took the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.223" offset="14760312">He didn't explicitly say, "No, it doesn't cover state prosecutions."</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.966" offset="14775254">What he said was, "It is necessary that it covers state prosecutions," because under the Murdock decision, this -- the -- the statute would be perfectly valid even if it covered only federal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.090" offset="14827708">And of course, this -- this petitioner had counsel with him, who could advice him just as -- as well as any other lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.570" offset="14861667">Now, also on appeal, the statement has been made that the Government argued that this did not cover state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.421" offset="14897089">I would like to be a little more explicit and perhaps a little more precise as to what the Government's position has been generally under this statute in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.166" offset="14936064">We -- I don't believe that it ever taken the position that it does not cover state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.004" offset="14959365">We have generally said that we think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.721" offset="14970232">But in the lower courts, we have said that it doesn't have to cover state prosecutions because under the Murdock rule, it wasn't necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.820" offset="15006699">The -- the federal courts, on the whole, have adopted that position that is most of them have said even the Sixth Circuit in the Tedesco case which thought that there was doubt as to the power of Congress to extend immunity of the state prosecutions, said it had no doubt that the statute purported or Congress intended to cover state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.815" offset="15086634">And that was also true by -- of an opinion of Judge Bryan, Judge Frederick van Pelt Bryan in the Pagano case and some other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.322" offset="15116622">And in this case, though the Government's brief on appeal which I have here in the Court of Appeals did argue quite strenuously that under Murdock, the -- it was unnecessary to cover state prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.481" offset="15165315">It did contain this paragraph which I should like to read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.603" offset="15181824">“If Congress has the power, immunity from both federal and state prosecution should be granted under the Narcotic Control Act, if it does not," that is if Congress does not have the power, "then the statute should be held constitutional by a construction limiting it to federal prosecution."</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.239" offset="15252355">So I think accurately that position of the Government has never been that it does not cover state prosecutions but merely that it was unnecessary to go into that problem.</text>
