            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 40, Harold D. Rogers, versus Mark S. Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.113" offset="227871">Mr. Pollak, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="36.699" stopTime="315.660">
            <label>Mr. Louis H. Pollak</label>
            <text syncTime="36.699" offset="250128">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.982" offset="267264">This habeas corpus proceeding, brings before this Court, a murder conviction and sentence of death which are now six years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.291" offset="324524">It is a conviction and death sentence which Judge Smith formally of the District Court in Hartford, and recently elevated to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has twice had occasions to say was obtained in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.854" offset="418774">How then does it come that we are here as petitioners complaining of a failure to grant the writ of habeas corpus?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.636" offset="461928">I submit to the Court that the case is one which raises at the most dramatic and hazardous level of life itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.624" offset="521906">The question of the vitality of the constitutional rights protected by the Due Process Clause and of the federal habeas corpus statute designed to vindicate those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.154" offset="571956">This case comes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.455" offset="581151">I think this Court knows for the third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.368" offset="596825">The first, on a petition for certiorari from the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.172" offset="640084">A petition which was denied, a petition which raised questions of the validity of petitioner's murder conviction based on contentions that incriminating statements were admitted in evidence against them at trial which were coerced and further that he was twice before each of those incriminating statements were elicited, twice denied access to his already retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.739" offset="750320">After the denial of certiorari in 1956, habeas corpus proceedings before Judge Smith were instituted which resulted in a grant of habeas corpus by him, a reversal by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and a denial by this Court of certiorari, a denial however accompanied as this Court will remember by an opinion, a memorandum opinion construing the Court of Appeals' opinion, an opinion which is at 357 U.S. 220 and which is reprinted at page 14 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.365" offset="908831">The case comes here today on a grant of certiorari by this Court last February, a grant to review the Court of Appeals affirmance of Judge Smith's ultimate reluctant denial of the writ of habeas corpus, a denial of company as I've said by his second assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.312" offset="1004648">Harold Rogers has been convicted by the State of Connecticut and sentenced to death by the State of Connecticut in defiance of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.250" offset="1048325">As the case stands today, it presents to this Court, three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.307" offset="1076642">The two initially raised on review, unsuccessful petition for certiorari from the State Supreme Court, the coercive character of the incriminating statements admitted against petitioner, and the questions of denial of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.303" offset="1148635">And third, and this is -- at this point perhaps the dominant question in the case, the question of the scope of the inquiry which can be made by the Federal District Court sitting in habeas corpus when that inquiry goes beyond the inquiry already made by the state trier whether in Court or jury which has already considered in some degree the constitutional claims of the applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.164" offset="1288025">In this case, the problems involved whether the District Judge is bound by so-called factual findings of the state trier, whether the District Judge may take testimony to amplify whatever light is thrown by the state transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.455" offset="1365243">I submit --</text>

            <text syncTime="315.660" offset="1365974">Mr. Pollak, I don't want to break in when you get in the mainstream of your argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.598" offset="1385723">But it would help me a great deal when you come to the crux of your argument, you would state exactly what was before the state court when the appeal came through it with reference to the admissibility of the confession of (Inaudible) confessions --</text>

            <text syncTime="348.638" offset="1497945">What -- what there was before this -- what there was before the state trial court as both he hearing before the judges and the absence of -- without the presence of the jury and then what went before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.548" offset="1561579">Then what went up to the Connecticut Supreme Court, what they actually rule, and what is after all the ultimate constitutional question here namely, whether this if is a confession, is that the core of the constitution?</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="382.205" offset="1632214">Because a lot of the things are merely evidentiary considerations with reference to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.869" offset="1650813">With so much discussion about whether he did or didn't ask for consul, but not only there, that isn't a constitutional issue apart from bearing upon the so-called confessions, am I right?</text>
