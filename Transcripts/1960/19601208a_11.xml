            <text syncTime="138.983" offset="659310">I also called the attention of the Court to the fact that the Lords day Act intentionally selected a day in which the majority of people already abstain from work and that in the language of Judge Magruder, it gave special protection to the majority of faith and did not give the same protection to minority faiths that believed in the seventh day as the Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.860" offset="754813">And third and this bears on the question I think, Mr. Justice Brennan, asked me yesterday.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.193" offset="884172">This is a question of whether everybody must abstain from work on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.212" offset="900263">Now, we have no evidence that in this modern world with all of its complications, that that is a compelling reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.212" offset="928266">As a matter of fact, the -- the scores of exceptions in this Act themselves indicate that that's a wholly impracticable thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.611" offset="957837">So that when this Court comes to consider it, the third ground based upon -- the discussions and considerations that this Court has given in leading cases such as Schneider against Irvington and other cases, you'll come to the question of weighing whether or not, the necessity for everybody resting on the same day, if it ever could be accomplished, is so compelling that these plaintiffs should be forced because of their religion and because of the law, to lose 52 days for one reason and 52 days for another, during the course of the year.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.732" offset="3294333">I would say just one thing in closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.033" offset="3307499">Yesterday, a question was asked to Mr. Ehrmann, I think by Justice Black, as to what would happen if Massachusetts reenacted its statute, assuming this Court struck down the present one and reenacted it in a manner which said this is purely a day of rest, thus, excluding any problem of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.172" offset="3396106">I'm not sure that we had a direct answer to it, but I would suggest that if this Court felt that Massachusetts could reenact a statute on any particular day, whether it'd be Thursday or Sunday, excluding therefrom any reference to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.894" offset="3462980">We have then in effect, just what is before you today in the sense that our statute by our Supreme Court has been interpreted to be one which is for a day of rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.974" offset="3511254">Mr. Ehrmann has called attention to numerous Massachusetts decisions where he indicates as a contrary holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.893" offset="3542915">I would ask the Court in examining the cases, to note that Massachusetts has decided the question of religion in only two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.723" offset="3582307">One, is the Has case, which clearly says it is a day of rest, the second is the Chernock case, which very recently, has reaffirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.834" offset="3622745">And any other case in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not one which relates to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.420" offset="3653047">The attack in any of those other cases was as to the meaning of the words, whether a particular individual had or had not violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.981" offset="3695261">So, Massachusetts has twice been called upon to determine whether this is a statute governing religion or establishing one and twice has said it is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.068" offset="3823679">Well, I would say that a statute could be enacted, Your Honor, with no exceptions whatsoever in a sense that say, if Thursday were picked, there need be no exception for an atheist, there need be no exception for a Christian, there need be no exception for a member of the Jewish faith and we would say that the failure to put in an exemption per se, is not any constitutional difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.819" offset="3922631">It is a question of whether the full thrust of a law which might oppress certain groups, whether they be religious or economic or otherwise, might by a court, be softened to some extent by putting in an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.426" offset="3981040">So that the hardship on those groups is somewhat lessened and we would say that for that reason, it may be highly desirable to put them in but constitutionally, they would not be required and we would say that in Massachusetts, we have felt called upon to do just exactly that.</text>
