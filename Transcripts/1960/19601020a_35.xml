            <text syncTime="32.055" offset="231633">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.466" offset="253262">This case involves the question of indemnification or recoupment of losses by a steamship owner who has had to pay damages or who has sustained loss because of the personal injury to a longshoreman, who was an employee of an independent stevedoring company.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.419" offset="385024">The facts in this case briefly are that the steamship had found real or it's in the port of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.723" offset="434239">And while there, he was unloading a cargo of sugar in bags and the discharging work was being done by the respondent here which was an independent stevedoring contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.998" offset="523368">He was engaged or it was rather, by the consignee or owner of the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.349" offset="584808">He was not employed by the vessel owner to discharge this cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.713" offset="618245">While the cargo was being discharged, one Jasper King, one of the longshoremen was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.941" offset="659101">Briefly, the reason for his injury is that this cargo bags was stowed from forward to aft in the whole of the vessel, from the forward bulkhead back to about the center of the hatch and from the bottom of the vessel up to the twin dike.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.420" offset="769024">In other words, that left a vertical wall all the way across the ship of bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.080" offset="799744">Partly in the hatch, forward part and the rest of the hatch, the lateral half of the hatch was opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.402" offset="841017">This vertical wall was held in place by sufficient shoring and support so that it didn't fall down.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.555" offset="877589">When the stevedores started to work, they started in the portion of the stow which was at the top of the hatch and they started to take these bags of sugar out of the square of the hatch and they worked forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.056" offset="959613">And as they did this, they broke down the stow, a distance of six feet or more in height.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.743" offset="998379">So that the men, when they were working in, the cargo had walls of cargo around them of higher than they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.613" offset="1029831">And the testimony in the case, that as they were working forward in this hatch, one of the bags was not centrally placed down in the stow so that the weight of the bag on top was without support or some bags and they fell down.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.713" offset="1134216">That is alleged to be the unseaworthy condition existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.773" offset="1158457">The testimony is that this was not a safe and proper way to do this work, that they should not have broken it down to such a height.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.378" offset="1204851">They should've worked it out frigidly so that the men that are working in a whole which was higher than they were should have bags not so high above them.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.886" offset="1250931">And expert testimony was had and said that this was not safe and proper way of doing the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.061" offset="1427623">The ship joined in the stevedore claiming that if the ship is held liable by reason of any acts of the stevedore that it claimed indemnity over.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.925" offset="1499094">And so, the case went to trial on the issue between the ship and the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.015" offset="1539427">It being contended that the cargo being stowed in such a way that it was probably unsafe or unseaworthy and that the stevedores, in the manner in which they sought to unload this cargo, stowed as it was, were negligent and pursued an improper procedure, thereby, bringing into play the unseaworthiness for cargo which caused the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.718" offset="1742242">At the end of the case, the trial judge directed a verdict in favor of the third-party defendant, the stevedore, on the ground that there couldn't be any recovery or recoupment here on the -- as a matter of law because there was no contractual privity between the stevedore and the owner of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.530" offset="1897514">And that is the question which is now submitted to this Court for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.083" offset="1939728">The Court of Appeals first heard the case on appeal from that judgment and affirmed it per curiam opinion, Judge -- Chief Judge Biggs dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.339" offset="2004720">Then a reargument was had and then came the decision of this Court in Crumady and Fisser.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.631" offset="2045889">At that time, the reargument had been refused but on our petition, the Court permitted us out of time to ask for a rehearing in the light of Crumady and Fisser, which was had and notwithstanding Crumady and Fisser, the Court affirmed the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.484" offset="2145259">And the argument which we had before the Court of Appeals on the last argument was what then the decision of this Court means in Crumady and Fisser, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.781" offset="2206490">We had seven judges on the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.784" offset="3418467">I don't think the stipulation closes any door on that whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.498" offset="3441351">Frankly, I must say to you that at the time when this case first started of in 1954, we were not very well informed as to what course these various Ryan case and -- and Weyerhaeuser and Crumady and Fisser were going to take and we had always rather assume that any relationship for whereby the stevedore came aboard was tantamount to some sort of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.812" offset="3578650">But now, Your Honors, in the Crumady and Fisser case, as I read it, I have said now, it does make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.306" offset="3616580">Is -- here's what -- you -- the language which you have used which I have in mind, "We think this case is governed by the principle announced in the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.505" offset="3669347">The warranty which a stevedore owes when he goes aboard a vessel to perform services is plainly for the benefit of the vessel whether the vessel owners are parties to the contract or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.318" offset="3744684">That is enough to bring the vessel into the zone of modern law that recognizes rights in third-party beneficiaries."</text>
            <text syncTime="921.578" offset="3789720">Restatement, Law of Contracts, Section 133.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.551" offset="3809573">Moreover, as we said in the Ryan case, "competency and safety of stowage are inescapable elements of the service undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.126" offset="3859832">They are part of the stevedore's warranty of workmanlike service that is comparable to a manufacturer's warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product."</text>
            <text syncTime="951.587" offset="3909674">Now, that is, as I say, that indicates to me that Your Honors are -- have recognized in this particular field of law the theory of third-party beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.770" offset="3970487">And I think that is very sound and I think that's the way it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.722" offset="4002252">We must take in to account the realities of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.451" offset="4025135">For instance, ships are run particular cargo ships have businesses carrying cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.211" offset="4060244">It's just as important that the cargo be put in to the ship as it is that it'd be taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.226" offset="4084276">Now, the ship is run on the various situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.185" offset="4100159">An owner is not always trading for his own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.401" offset="4116982">He may have his vessel out on a years time charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.312" offset="4132655">That time charter may have the -- the option or the right under his charge to serve lent to somebody else for three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.755" offset="4170376">The second sub charterer, he may in turn choose to put it all on a forged charterer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.832" offset="4202663">The -- the steam shipowner has got a long way away from his ship by then but it's still his ship and he is responsible for what goes on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.159" offset="4244041">So, therefore, it seems to be a tough proposition to put through a shipowner that he has got to make sure that he's got a contract with every stevedore who works for a third charterer or somebody else, somewhere in the world in order that he can protect himself against what the stevedore does far had been making damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.306" offset="4352606">And that just doesn't have any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.832" offset="4370683">Therefore, it shouldn't be that the shipowner has got to be in contractual privity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.589" offset="4457723">But the Court of Appeals says no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.124" offset="4467858">It says you've got to have a contract between the two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.253" offset="4484368">There's no contract here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.238" offset="4492309">The ship and the receiver of the cargo are strangers, which is a specular thing to cite because it must be realized that the ship is a business of carrying cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.395" offset="4552913">Somebody is going to put cargo in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.535" offset="4565556">Somebody has got to put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.835" offset="4574751">Somebody has got to take it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.207" offset="4584155">That's just as important the thing as having a sound whole and every shipowner knows that somewhere along the line, somebody is going to take it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.165" offset="4628041">So there is no great magic in saying that you must have a contract between the stevedore and the shipowner where it has an interest in the cargo is going to see that he gets out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.251" offset="4684361">The shipowner knows somebody is going to park a cargo -- a stevedore and very quickly where you have a charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.767" offset="4718425">Each one (Inaudible) is given the right to nominate a stevedore even though in some instances, the ship pays the -- the stevedore in charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.130" offset="4759907">And when the stevedore comes aboard to discharge cargo in the presence of the master and with his knowledge and consent, he has got a win for his services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.592" offset="4809749">If who ever hires him don't pay, so to say that the guy like that is a strange man is a very curious idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.664" offset="4846007">He certainly isn't a trespasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.851" offset="4854784">And we all know that stevedore contractors don't go walking along walls looking for a ship where he thinks he can slide aboard and salvage or -- some cargo by way of doing stevedoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.544" offset="4909537">So I think the new point of that question is or the Court of Appeals is entirely unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.509" offset="4949452">Now, in -- in the committee in Fisser case, there was no contract between the shipowner and the stevedore if the contract was made between the stevedore and the charterers' agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.761" offset="5022386">Now, there's nothing to make the case that's charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.668" offset="5034088">Charter was agent, was representing the ship when he made the contract for the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.495" offset="5057390">Obviously he was representing the charterers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.907" offset="5070973">But there, you said it made no difference so we take you at word on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.291" offset="5224573">So that whoever makes the -- the deal, the stevedore is going to come on board, he's going to do the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2272.748" offset="9194350">And that is the allegation in the petitioner's pleading as to why it paid King, the longshoreman because it was absolute liability because of it unseaworthy condition which it in fact brought about due to the fact that we could not discover, if you please, or look down below, if you please, or as the testimony might be and as I was rather embarrassed because the testimony of the speaking of proper procedure with man height and then there's a question of how many inches had man height was so -- but they did put it a little higher than I am tall.They put it I think in around six feet or five feet and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.550" offset="9413569">But, in their own pleading, they alleged of an underlying cause of this -- of the improper placing of that stowage at the foot of that tier which causes to collapse.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.640" offset="13153886">And I respectfully refer you to Note 6, in the Ryan Stevedoring case where, and that's the majority opinion, I'm going to refer to minority opinion in a few moments, written by Justice Black, where they pointed out that they do not reach the exclusionary effect of the Longshoreman's Act and they cite Brown and Crawford decided by the Third Circuit that in order to -- if they did that, they were circumventing and invading in doing by indirection that which the statute positively prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.974" offset="13343222">Now, I think that that is probably more forcibly stated by Mr. Justice Black in the minority opinion in the Ryan case but as recently quoted, statement came out, the amount of the Oregon District Court while they followed the Crumady in the case, there are some observations there about the development of these -- these five cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.566" offset="13485641">But it points out very clearly that -- quoting Justice Black, concurred in by the Chief Justice, Justice Douglas and Justice Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.181" offset="13540080">Liability is thus imposed because of the negligence of the employer's other employee and this, the Act forbids.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.832" offset="13838712">I -- I deduce that the majority opinion in the Ryan case held that there could be no recovery unless there was a contractual relationship and that recovery had to be based upon that contractual relationship, otherwise, it violated the exclusive provisions of the Longshoreman's Act which says no recovery, just as what.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.582" offset="13945710">Now, there had been -- I know there has been mentions of the New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.483" offset="13973295">They modeled after or our statute being modeled after the New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.568" offset="13997641">It so happens to be that I was with the United States Shipping Board starting in 1921, right -- several years after World War I and remained at the Marine Insurance Profit from 1926 and we've studied this very statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.782" offset="14074546">And I may say that models may seem alike in all respects but they're not always alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.503" offset="14121357">And that is true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.453" offset="14141210">I, therefore, go now to this question of a -- in which this District Court has gone to extending in the MacPherson-Buick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.530" offset="14197530">I personally have no quarrel with the Crumady decision on its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.068" offset="14227623">I have quarrel upon the reasoning of MacPherson and it's pointed in this provision and everything else and the tort cases and if you follow MacPherson to its full extent, cross around tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.317" offset="14312678">That tort against to whom the crime or injury is committed would be the longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.719" offset="14354265">The relationship is pointed out in the Ryan Stevedoring case, was not on tort but is on contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.762" offset="14386448">And if you follow the reasoning as suggested in the MacPherson case, you come to the point where the stevedore himself is under the warrant as a rank direct action under Longshoreman's Act against the employer and I don't believe the conscience of any judge could sustain that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.395" offset="14492923">And that is also pointed out that that is the full cycle of this metamorphous situation in which we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.689" offset="14530121">I want to say one more thing with respect to the question of our merchant marine and American Merchant Marines and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.736" offset="14570350">We have foreign ships coming in here far more than ever indicated by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.111" offset="14599816">And you all are familiar with the (Inaudible) support which is put up by the Government, all available to you if you look at it very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.263" offset="14636387">And it's referred to in the (Inaudible) citation in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.142" offset="14659897">But let me say this to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.048" offset="14675571">The economic situation of our American Merchant Marine and this is clear in those reports, as if everyone of our competitors are operating in as much less economical posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.985" offset="14731264">Yet, it is now being suggested that we can have inefficient stowage of the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.110" offset="14775777">We can have malfunctioning on machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.412" offset="14793017">We can have everything in the world go wrong with that piece of machinery in that ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.078" offset="14819662">And when it's brought to our American port, as an -- as a foreign flagship with that competitor of ours, carrying our cargoes, doing everything else but we still have got to clear it out, observe and correct the very defects, the foreign countries are paying their men, 75% wages less than ours are to do that thing and then we're asked to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.199" offset="14960201">And if you'll deduce me one more second, there are two kinds of an insurance in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.799" offset="14990608">One is protection in indemnity that has been all the time carried by the whole that is the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.730" offset="15026343">That is for the protection of injured employees, seamen, damage appears and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.397" offset="15060929">That's an expense, and that's an expense which are public is going to have to pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.552" offset="15085589">In addition to that, if we have to be responsible to seek out and discover and correct the negligence of people, foreign ships who are ill-trained, ill-paid then we are asking to be paid a double premium to our public because our people also have got to take out insurance that protect themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.902" offset="15222993">And I'm not going to say anything about the Halcyon case, and Justice Black in the Halcyon case, pointed so clearly and repudiated completely the argument that this Court to take upon itself the legislation with respect to joint tortfeasors in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.063" offset="15323617">I see no reason for me to say anything about it except to say this that the brief had served upon the Government on September the 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.750" offset="15378369">They were asked which department it was whether it was the Maritime Commission, whether it was the Secretary of Defense, whether it was the Secretary of Labor or whether it was the state departments or the executive department that favored this Court to legislate in a manner where the Congress has already legislated and just stopped short of the question and it's so forcibly based by the majority of the Court in Justice Black's decision in Halcyon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.834" offset="15534686">Therefore, I ask Your Honors to unanimously affirm the court below.</text>
