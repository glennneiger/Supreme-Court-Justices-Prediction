            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="21.659" offset="190046">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.216" offset="208227">This case is here on certiorari to review an order of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia setting aside an order of the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.131" offset="255875">The order of the Atomic Energy Commission continued, in effect, a provisional construction permit authorizing the other petitioner, Power Reactor Development Corporation to construct an atomic power plant outside Detroit, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.577" offset="329644">The provisional construction permit authorized the continuance of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.291" offset="352528">It did not authorize the operation of the reactor which could not be done until there had been a further proceeding followed by the issuance of a license to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.449" offset="405191">The court below set aside the order of the Commission on the ground that its findings concerning safety did not satisfy the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.388" offset="448972">I would like to ask the Court's indulgence to postpone any further discussion of the issues or decision below, although I recognize it's unusual, until I have given a rather lengthy exposition of the fact because I'm convinced that the issues in the case become quite clear and understandable once the factual situation has been thoroughly described.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.917" offset="543013">And I do assure you that I will come back to them later.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.759" offset="562448">All atomic reactors rest upon the fact that there are some atoms, chiefly in Uranium, which can be split into smaller particles.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.079" offset="603721">The nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons, smaller particles.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.924" offset="635068">In Uranium, the protons and neutrons usually total 238, but there's a very small proportion in which the protons and neutrons add up to only 235.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.050" offset="687522">And U-235, as it is called, has the capacity to split apart when it is struck by another free neutron, so that if you had one atom of U-235, getting struck by one free neutron, you would then have three results that are significant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.921" offset="767039">First, you would have the release of energy, chiefly energy in the form of flying fragments, the kinetic energy, which, when they bumped into each other and bumped into other substances around, would be transformed into heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.598" offset="825762">And the function of this reactor is to capture that energy in the form of heat, turn it into steam and then use the steam to generate electricity which is fed into or will be fed, in time, into a normal utility grid.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.434" offset="901099">The second consequence of the fission is radioactive waste, the particles that are left.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.287" offset="932551">And they are, for a time highly, dangerous to man or other forms of life and one of the problems, in building an atomic reactor, is to make sure that none of that radioactive waste, either at normal operation or as a consequence of any abnormal accident, will escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.090" offset="1023770">The third consequence of a fission is the release of free neutrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.862" offset="1046862">Now, if you had 100 fissions, to take a small number, actually, we're dealing with billions, if you had 100 fissions and then they release just enough free neutrons to cause another 100 fissions as they struck atoms of U-235, obviously, you'd have a self-sustaining chain reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.463" offset="1129200">If you had only 95 out of 100 in each generation, cause another fission, then the reaction would not be self-sustaining, it would run down.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.912" offset="1170996">On the other hand, if you had 105, which would be terribly fast increase, you would have the number of fissions, multiply itself many times over in a very small period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.276" offset="1232436">The problem of the early atomic scientist was to achieve the self-sustaining chain reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.530" offset="1265455">The problem of the man building an atomic power reactor is to control the free neutrons in such a way that he can raise the level up to the level at which he wants it to operate and then hold it there, operating it just each generation of neutrons reproducing itself or to take it down later if he wishes to take it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.673" offset="1370049">This is done chiefly by controlling the freight of the free neutrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.967" offset="1395231">The various ways of doing that, one, is obviously to increase the number of U-235 atoms in your fuel because if you have more U-235 atoms, the chance that a free neutron will strike one in such a way to cause fission increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.462" offset="1465240">Equally, if you increase the amount of fuel, the chance that a free neutron will strike a U-235 atom before it escapes from the fuel and becomes irrelevant is obviously going to increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.956" offset="1519156">And just the amounts of fuel which will sustai -- create a self-sustaining chain reaction, you will find often in this record, called the critical size or critical mass.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.149" offset="1575999">Another way of controlling the fate of the free neutrons, which becomes important here, is to put into the fuel something that will capture them without causing a fission.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.398" offset="1628975">For example, if you put boron, another element, into the fuel, it will capture the free neutrons, so they can't strike other atoms and reduce or bring an end to the chain reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.218" offset="1672234">And all reactors have boron control rods, so that you can -- by inserting it, the reaction will be cut down, by withdrawing it, you can permit it to increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.303" offset="1740570">And they also have, as I will show a little later with this model, boron safety rods, which can be suddenly inserted in the event of any mishap in order to shut the whole thing down.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.464" offset="1801279">At the present time, there are operating in the United States some 115 reactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.709" offset="1834193">The variant size from small experimental reactors to large-scale power reactors such as we have involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.073" offset="1871705">There are 90 more that are being built.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.424" offset="1885080">Two of the large-scale power reactors are located near big cities, one outside Chicago, one outside Detroit and there are others near smaller cities like Albany, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.215" offset="1944221">Most of the large-scale power reactors are what are known as thermal reactors because they depend for the reaction on slow neutrons, which I'll describe in a minute, rather than the fast neutrons on which the PRDC reactor were built, it will depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.049" offset="2035545">One of the characteristics of an atom of U-235 is that for some reason, it splits more easily when it's hit by a neutron going slowly than when it's hit by a neutron going fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.543" offset="2093537">So what scientist does is to put into the reactor in and around the fuel something called a moderator that will slow the neutron down without capturing it and thereby increase the number of fissions that takes place for a given number of free neutrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.657" offset="2161977">And those are called thermal reactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.958" offset="2175248">The PRDC reactor will not slow the neutrons down.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.168" offset="2196041">It's therefore less efficient in achieving fissions than a thermal reactor.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.235" offset="2216312">But the fast neutrons have a characteristic that slow neutrons don't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.024" offset="2239509">The fast neutrons, when they hit U-238, the non-fissionable Uranium, a certain proportion of them turn the non-fissionable Uranium into Plutonium.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.031" offset="2295515">And Plutonium is itself a fissionable material.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.595" offset="2313801">The result is that a fast reactor like this one will create more fissionable material than it burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.892" offset="2342954">One of the witnesses in the record said this is like starting off an automobile trip with your gasoline tank half full, driving 500 miles, buying no gas and arriving at home with a full gasoline tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.657" offset="2398020">The trick, of course, is that you are using up the non-fissionable U-238.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.808" offset="2422575">You aren't really getting something for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.630" offset="2433860">But U-238 is quite plentiful whereas U-235 is very rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.444" offset="2457161">And therefore, as the Commission found in this case, the successful use of a fast breeder reactor would be a great step forward in increasing the amount of atomic fuel and therefore, increasing the amount of potential energy in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.520" offset="2529468">Of course, the great importance of such reactors as this is that they do hold out a great hope of enabling many areas in the world that don't have sources of energy now to obtain a cheap source of the electric energy which is necessary not only to economic well-being, but some people think to a stable political society because such communities don't have hydroelectric power and the expense of shipping in oil or coal would be very, very great indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.096" offset="2675754">And of course, atomic energy is, for ourselves, a reserve against the possible loss of oil or coal, both of which are being consumed that is very, very fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.522" offset="2737507">The record of atomic reactors, the safety record in this country, seems to me to be very high, indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.365" offset="2776795">There has been no regularly operating reactor.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.889" offset="2790902">I used "regularly operating" to exclude those being used to perform scientific experiments.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.493" offset="2817337">There's been no accident with the regularly operating reactor which has resulted in any injury to anyone leaving aside -- in the regularly operating ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.828" offset="2866657">Even counting the reactors in which scientific experiments are being performed outside of laboratories which don't have the usual facilities of a reactor, there had, until January 1960, been no accident involving either a fatality to anyone or an injury to a member of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.131" offset="2959862">Unfortunately, there was one reactor accident in Idaho in 1960 in an experimental reactor which did result in the deaths of three employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.726" offset="3002284">Even there, however, there was no injury to any member of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.084" offset="3019734">No radioactive waste in significant quantities was found outside the reactor building and the building had none of the safeguards which would be associated with any developmental power reactor of this kind, none of the containment to keep radioactive waste in.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.624" offset="3097893">The proposed PRDC reactor will be located at Laguna Beach which is about 35 miles from the center of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.134" offset="3143868">The whole plant, of course, comprises normal generating facilities, boilers and other things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.994" offset="3183365">But I have here an -- a model of the reactor.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.497" offset="3205308">This is a scale of about 7-to-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.010" offset="3219414">The reactor itself will be 60 -- 65 inches -- 65 inches high and this is about a foot high.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.738" offset="3258284">And it will be 80 inches in diameter.</text>

            <text syncTime="861.719" offset="3550229">This is, in fact, one of the subassemblies from the PRDC reactor.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.948" offset="3583143">They hang down, you see, the same as this does only they're locked in.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.336" offset="3604668">The subassembly, the outside, is simply a cover of stainless steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.697" offset="3630164">Inside it is this birdcage or honeycomb construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.636" offset="3673945">It holds these pins which are removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.684" offset="3690141">You can see them along the front here.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.146" offset="3699963">These are made up of Uranium.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.438" offset="3709158">These are steel so that we can handle them, but in the reactor, they will be made up of Uranium which has 27%, the fissionable U-235.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.274" offset="3752417">And the whole thing is filled with the solid pins.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.137" offset="3767881">Then this honeycomb or birdcage construction holds the pins rigidly in place, for a reason that I will explain a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.456" offset="3801213">And all that is in, when it's in place, you wouldn't be able to see the inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.492" offset="3817305">It's in this stainless steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.565" offset="3829635">The -- when the reaction is taken -- no, one thing more I should explain going back to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.959" offset="3867251">What I had there corresponded to the blue of a single one of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.702" offset="3894209">The non-blue, the silver part, is physically very similar to this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.556" offset="5525608">I'm going to come to the maximum possible explosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.986" offset="5543267">The original application before the Atomic Energy Commission was filed on January 6, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.578" offset="5577644">The Commission referred the application to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards which had no statutory standing at the time, but which now has statutory standing under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.406" offset="5628949">The Commission made a report on the proposed reactor which was non-committal and certainly some people would say it was discouraging, although I think non-committal is the more accurate word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.994" offset="5687359">The Commission then had the staff make certain further studies about the safety of the reactor and in August 1956, the Commission issued a provisional construction permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.118" offset="5751829">The issuance of that permit, let me say very candidly, gave rise to a great deal of criticism, both because it was issued in the face of a non-committal, if not discouraging ACRS report because that report had not been published, it was treated as an executive document, and because no hearings had been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.752" offset="5850363">The point that I want to emphasize is that the validity of the original construction permit, the August 1956 permit, is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.837" offset="5894771">That's not the order that was before the Court of Appeals and not the order which is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.932" offset="5915146">After that permit was issued, the ACRS report was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.519" offset="5941478">The labor unions, who are respondents in this Court, intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.374" offset="5956838">There were very long and detailed hearings at which most of the members, the ACRS testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.012" offset="5983378">The Commission made findings, heard briefs and had oral argument and then issued the order which is before this Court for review, which was an order, making certain findings and continuing the construction permit in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.084" offset="6043669">So in our view, the earlier criticism is not pertinent at all to the later phase of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.626" offset="6081912">Indeed, if you read the criticisms cited in respondent's brief with any care, you will find that most of them plainly and all of them, I think, by fair inference, applied to this original provisional construction permit and not to the findings which were before the Court of Appeals and are here for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.116" offset="6163832">Now, when the original PRDC application was filed, it was not complete in the sense that it contained all the details of the final design of this reactor as it would operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.791" offset="6222555">There's nothing unusual about that, let me emphasize, not only in the case of atomic energy but in the case of all kinds of research and development today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.858" offset="6262784">Frequently, science -- scientist can project a solution for certain problems long before the engineers are actually able to build something to test the basis and to try it out in person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.916" offset="6319000">And it also is a fact, which I think any engineer or scientist would agree to today, that frequently in the course of construction, you are able to solve problems that couldn't be solved until the construction had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.454" offset="6377200">And certainly, you are able to make test that could not be made until the construction had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.683" offset="6406144">This is especially familiar in the Atomic Energy Industry and the Commission has a regulation which bares directly on this point and which we think is the key regulation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.746" offset="6462360">It's Reg.50.35, which you will find on page 135 of the Government's main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.116" offset="6507813">It says, in effect, I won't read it all because it's quite long, that where the applicant is unable to furnish full technical explanation, nevertheless, the Commission may issue a provisional construction permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.636" offset="6565909">If the Commission finds, and I now quote, "That it -- right from the middle of 50.35, "That it has information sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that a facility of the general type proposed can be constructed and operated at the proposed location without undue risk to the health and safety of the public."</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.206" offset="6660159">But then the latter part of 50.35 goes on and says "That this permit and the issuance of an eventual license to operate is conditional upon the very end, an evaluation by the Commission that the final design provides reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public will not be endangered."</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.881" offset="6754931">Now, there's one semantic problem that I want to come straight at here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.702" offset="6774157">You will note that the part I read first speaks of a facility of the general type proposed and speaks of reasonable assurance that a facility of the general type proposed can be constructed and operated at the proposed location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.159" offset="6843956">When these hearings were being held before the Commission, a reference to the PRDC reactor, in one sense, of course, was a reference to a specific thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.291" offset="6884498">It was something at Laguna Beach that they wanted to build there and it was described by the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.561" offset="6917622">In another sense, any reference to the PRDC reactor at that stage was necessarily a reference to a general type of reactor because within the plans that had thus far been filed, a number of variance were possible and indeed, there might be changes in the specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.598" offset="7001736">So that when you -- so that this is a matter of degree of generality and it's very easy to slip here from speaking of the reactors if it were a specific thing, but when in fact, it's only a general type until the alternatives have been excluded by getting all the details of a specific set of plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="2310.439" offset="9345128">But nevertheless, and here is the point, I make, nevertheless, the Commission took the view that before it could permit such a reactor to operate, the applicant must demonstrate that such an explosion couldn't occur, that this hypothetical thing couldn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.582" offset="9433736">Now, in theory, it shouldn't be able to happen because when the heat in a reactor goes off, a great many things happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.217" offset="9492250">But one of the things that happen is that the fuel expands and each atom gets a little farther apart from every other atom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.436" offset="9521089">And therefore, it should take a little longer for the neutron to get to it and cause a fission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.655" offset="9541987">And this should slow down the rate of reproduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.193" offset="9560168">Nevertheless, at the time of the hearings, ERB I, the first of these experimental fast breeder reactors, had partially melted down in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.385" offset="9604890">It was during a time when a great many safety mechanisms were disconnected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.842" offset="9622758">But the fact was that it had happened and this seemed to indicate possibly that there was something about fast breeder reactors, which made the theory I just tried to state very simply, insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.243" offset="9688377">Now, at the time of the hearing, the -- there was a theoretical scientific explanation for the meltdown at ERB I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.376" offset="9736861">If you conceive of a hotspot in the inside of the reactor here, the inside of the blue, then the pins and the entire fuel element, the side nearest the heat should get hotter than the side away from the heat, this might make it expand and this might make the whole thing bow inward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.882" offset="9842918">And this would bring the fuel closer together and might therefore cause a speeding up of the reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.642" offset="9877922">And this was what the scientist thought, at the time of the hearing, was the explanation for the meltdown in ERB I, but nobody had empirically proved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.834" offset="9926719">It has been proved today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.480" offset="9933302">There's -- there's no question about it now, but at the time of the hearing, it hadn't been empirically proved and that's why the Commission said, "We think it's going to prove out a certain way, but at this stage, we can't be sure."</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.370" offset="9988890">There was also before the Commission at the hearing evidence of three ways of preventing any future bowing, upholding the fuel elements rigidly in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.676" offset="10042075">But at that stage, no one had proved, again empirically, whether any what -- whether the three ways would be successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.787" offset="10086484">They have now proved by very elaborate tests, although it came after the hearing that this honeycomb construction -- that's what the honeycombs do, they hold the fuel elements rigidly in place and the larger subassemblies are also locked in place in a way that they can't bow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.141" offset="10167986">Now, against the background of this illustration, I suggest to you that the Commission's findings, to which I now turn, become quite plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.376" offset="10212916">And if the Court will look at page 706 which is in Volume 2, I'd like to call your attention to the concluding findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.595" offset="10265788">In Finding 18, the Commission turned its attention to this very type of problem and found first, it has not been positively established that a fast breeder reactor of the general type and the power level proposed by applicant can be operated without a credible possibility of releasing significant quantities of fission products to the environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.819" offset="13874657">It states it in terms of -- in those terms in Finding 18, which I read, to illustrate the difference between general assurance as to what investigation would prove and a specific finding of safety of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.781" offset="13938500">And it uses the very language of 50.35 here in 22 except for this phrase, "For the purposes of this provisional construction permit".</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.095" offset="13979773">And we think to suppose that the Commission had followed a proper standard all the way up to this point, and then also, it used the words of the regulation to suppose that it suddenly had a different meaning here is simply to accuse it of nonsense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3616.556" offset="14569618">The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 made a new departure from the previous monopoly that the Government had had of all atomic energy and the aim is stated by Congress was to encourage private participation in the peaceful development of atomic energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.396" offset="14660942">In order to set up the necessary regulation, the statute provides a very detailed licensing scheme for all transfers of fissionable material, for constructing or operating facilities for using them, even for an individual operator's license before you can be at the control board of a reactor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3738.305" offset="15056541">Then Section 104b authorizes the issuance of licenses for developmental reactors, that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.799" offset="15094575">And it provides that in issuing licenses, the Commission shall impose the minimum amount of such regulations and terms of license, as will permit the Commission to fulfill its obligations under this Act and to protect the health and safety of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.703" offset="15162180">And I emphasize again that it's the amount of regulation imposed by the Commission as will permit it to fulfill its obligations to protect the health and safety of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.477" offset="15209305">And over on a 112 down at (d), just before Section 105, there's a prohibition against issuing a license if, in the opinion of the Commission, the issuance of a license to such a person would be inimicable to the heath and safety of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.707" offset="15278164">And you will find in Section 161 a very broad general rule making power giving the Commission authority to make rules necessary to protect the health and safety of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.933" offset="15339081">Our view is, taking these sections of the Act first, that although Congress was obviously greatly concerned about safety as anyone would be, that it delegated that responsibility to the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.451" offset="15397177">And we think it's also quite clear from these provisions that the Commission was given full power to issue regulations dealing with safety, including regulations proscribing the findings to be made at the various stages of the construction and bringing up to power of a developmental reactor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.276" offset="15488502">And so that so far as these sections of the Act are concerned, it seems perfectly plain that the two-step procedure was within the statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.422" offset="15529044">The argument in the court below revolves very largely around Sections 182 and Section 185.182 begins over on page 123 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.874" offset="15590902">It describes what should be contained in license applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.549" offset="15613576">You'll note at the very beginning, each application for a license shall be in writing and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.784" offset="15634474">Then the second sentence, in connection with applications for licenses to operate production or utilization facilities, the applicant shall state such technical specifications, and I omit some words and such other information as the Commission, made by rule or regulation, deemed necessary in order to enable it to find that the utilization or production of special nuclear material will provide, on the next page, adequate protection of the health and safety of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.302" offset="15760593">Then, Justice Stewart, on page 126, you'll find the sections dealing with construction permits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3934.084" offset="15839692">First sentence says that, "Applicants for licenses shall, if the application is otherwise acceptable, be issued a construction permit."</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.548" offset="15873546">And then it goes on and provides what shall be in the permit, and finally that, "Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions," that I stated earlier, four of them, including meeting the requirements of the Commission's regulations, "a license to operate shall be issued”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.168" offset="15956093">Then you will find the last sentence reads, "For all other purposes of this Act, a construction permit is to be deemed a license."</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.411" offset="16001024">The respondent's argument is that relying on this sentence, one must read construction permit into the language in Section 182 which reads, "In connection with license -- with applications for licenses to operate production or utilization facilities, the applicant shall state certain information as will enable the Commission to find and so forth."</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.286" offset="16112515">Now, it seems to us that there are three self-sufficient answers to that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.339" offset="16140727">The first is that the second sentence of Section 185 is not applicable to licenses generally, but only to licenses to operate construction or utilization facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.161" offset="16196002">And we think the most meaning that can be given to this final sentence of 185 is that an application for a construction permit shall be the -- the equivalent of licenses generally, but not equivalent to any particular license or every particular license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.429" offset="16269040">Now, that at first blush may sound a little extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.828" offset="16282728">But I point out that the Act does set up specifications in some places for particular kinds of licenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="4117.305" offset="16572583">The court below seemed to say that in order to issue a construction permit for a reactor near a large city, the Commission must make a special finding that there were compelling reasons for putting it there.</text>

            <text syncTime="4133.112" offset="16635800">Rather than that in the desert someplace and the Commission didn't make that kind of finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.553" offset="16653563">Now, I don't really think this is a very serious issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.952" offset="16663176">The respondent's don't stand on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.046" offset="16671535">You can go all through the statute and try to find any mention of compelling reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.968" offset="16695254">And in addition, it's contrary to the established practice of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.747" offset="16714376">So I think in terms of the meaning of the statute, this is the critical issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.435" offset="16745096">My second answer, so far as the words go, is that the respondent's argument ignores the limitation at the end of Section 185 for all other purposes of this Act, a construction permit is to be deemed the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.792" offset="16810506">Now, I take it that means purposes other than those implied by 185.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.868" offset="16834853">It would seem to me quite clear from reading 185 that one of its purposes is to authorize a construction permit before you have got all the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.145" offset="16879992">Indeed, it speaks of the case where the applicant isn't able to supply all the information and speaks of finding it later before the license to operate is furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.869" offset="16930879">Then the third answer, which, again, I think is complete, is that Section 185 -- 182a does not proscribe the making of any particular finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.472" offset="16985213">If you will read it carefully, you'll see that it reads that in filing an application for a license for operating, the applicant shall include certain kinds of information that will enable the Commission to make a finding, but it doesn't say when those findings are to be made, nor does it say anything about what specific finding is to be made at any specific time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.892" offset="17082911">And it seems to me that the authority for the findings and the ruling the statutory provision is governing the findings that the Commission is to make are those in 104 that I called your attention to earlier and which it has detailed to some extent in its regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.174" offset="17168071">Now, if there is any doubt on the meaning of the statute, it would seem to us that that is clear enough by the uniform interpretation of the Commission and the Congressional acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.678" offset="17230033">It's perfectly clear that in all the other cases of developmental power reactors, this two-step procedure has been filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4336.952" offset="17451133">So, I guess you really know pretty much before you come on to the final hearing of what the Commission is requiring.</text>

            <text syncTime="4356.756" offset="17530441">It is also true that the two-step procedure on several occasions has been explained to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.225" offset="17572237">There, I think, can be no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.910" offset="17583000">And there has been the equivalent of acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.415" offset="17597001">The only way in which the consistent interpretation by the Commission and the reports to the -- to the congressional committee can be distinguished from this case is by that phrase, "For the purposes of this construction permit."</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.055" offset="17667636">That phrase did not appear in the hearings or licenses, construction permits issued earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.484" offset="17709328">This was, indeed, the only contested case, and it seems to me that anyone who reads the thrust of the whole findings will see that this was put in in order to make it plain that they were proceeding only a step at a time, and that they weren't either giving the company right or foreclosing any rights on the part of the respondent.</text>
