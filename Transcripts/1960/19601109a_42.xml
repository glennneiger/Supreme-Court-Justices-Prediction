            <text syncTime="24.340" offset="200704">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.181" offset="212093">This case arises out of a vague bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.316" offset="228603">It's here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.096" offset="247724">The petitioner is the Small Business Administration which is here challenging the denial by the court below of a statutory right explicitly conferred upon the Government by the Congress more than 160 years ago, the claim of priority in the distribution of the assets of the estate of an insolvent debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.708" offset="390248">The priority actually was written into the statute purposes far back as 1797.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.155" offset="436015">That is one of the two principal statutes with which we are here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.581" offset="453674">We set forth the text of that statute on page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.425" offset="473109">It provides -- it provides in -- in very broad unequivocal terms that whenever any person indebted the United States is insolvent, the debts due to the United States shall first be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.526" offset="537475">The other pivotal statute with which this case is concerned is the Bankruptcy Act’s priority provisions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.640" offset="573942">Now in the Bankruptcy Act, the Congress has carried over this right of priority under the 1797 statute and actually converted it into a fifth class priority in a bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.899" offset="643009">It is that fifth class priority, the Small Business Administration claims it is entitled to in this case and it is that fifth class priority that was denied to the Small Business Administration by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.998" offset="695359">I would like briefly to review the facts out of which this controversy emerges.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.570" offset="725661">In the -- in November of 1956, Byquist, the bankrupt in this case, a small wholesaler of electronic supplies and radio equipment, needed additional working capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.786" offset="802565">He solicited the aid of both the Small Business Administration and a local bank, a private bank, the Brookville State Bank of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.614" offset="845824">He filed applications with them under the Small Business Administration Act for a loan of $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.409" offset="876962">The bank took the position that it wasn't ready to extend the full $20,000 credit to him but that if the United States Government would participate with the bank, the Brookville State Bank and advanced $15,000 of the entire $20,000 loan sought by Byquist, the bank would add the additional $5000 and the $20,000 loan could be extended to Mr. Byquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.149" offset="992005">The bank took this matter up with the Small Business Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.685" offset="1006111">The Small Business Administration agreed to enter into a participation agreement with the bank so that the United States would advance 75% of the loan or $15,000 with the bank advancing the remaining $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.460" offset="1061177">At the time the United States entered into this -- to the Small Business Administration -- entered into this participation agreement with the bank and notified Mr. Byquist directly that his application has been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.447" offset="1113109">In the participation agreement, and I would like to invite Your Honors attention to page 5 of our brief because this is one of the crucial provisions in the participation agreement upon which the Court of Appeals seize in order to justify its forfeiture of this long standing priority dated back in 1797.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.770" offset="1198477">The -- on page 5, we set forth two of -- in quotes, two of the provisions of the participation agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.127" offset="1227839">The first one, paragraph 12, points out in effect that whenever any collection is made under the loan from the borrower, the proceeds are to be shared proportionately with both lenders, and that is three-fourths of each collection has to go to the United States and the remaining one-fourth to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.759" offset="1310386">Paragraph 14, the particular paragraph that the Court of Appeals relied on, also points out that -- in the event that there should be a loss under the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.091" offset="1343718">The loss should be shared in proportion to the investment of the United States in the one hand and the bank on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.404" offset="1372975">In other words, if there's a loss, United States gets stock to the extent of three-fourths of its interest and the bank only to the extent of its 25% interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.663" offset="1546010">As soon as -- as soon as the bank had agreed with the United States, United States agreed to supply $15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.310" offset="1568580">United States sent its check drawn on the United States Treasury for $15,000 to the Brookville Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.098" offset="1595747">Brookville Bank took the proceeds of that check, added $5,000 of its own money to it and made out a check to Byquist for $20,000, getting in exchange Byquist’s note for $20,000, made out payable to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.359" offset="1676831">About a year elapsed Byquist repaid about $4000 of the outstanding note, $3000 going to the United States, and $1000 going to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.115" offset="1719881">And he was thrown at the bankruptcy at that point, about a year after the note had been given to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.432" offset="1753109">When there was a balance of $16,000 due on the -- on the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.439" offset="1773171">After the bankruptcy, there was a formal assignment of the note itself from the bank to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.286" offset="1808488">And it was at that point, in answer to your question, that the United States filed on the bankruptcy proceeding in effect, a claim on its own behalf for the $12,000 due here on the note and also a claim on behalf of the bank for the $4000 due the bank on its share of the note.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="686.058" offset="2847640">I shouldn't think so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.394" offset="2852968">I shouldn't think that it's a pertinent consideration to the bankruptcy court at all, just as much as if the United States had decided the very last minute to waive whatever rights it might have had under this agreement and to -- to leave the parties in the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.573" offset="2909706">The -- the Government after filing its claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, had the claim rejected by the referee on the ground that this claim was not one due to United States but was in fact due to some separate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.594" offset="2985775">On appeal to the District Court, the District Court was dissatisfied with the reason the referee had given for rejecting the Government's claim and felt that the claim should be denied because the Government, the District Court thought was asserting a claim acquired by it for the first time after the petition of bankruptcy has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.301" offset="3064560">Now the Court of Appeals, apparently dissatisfied with both of those grounds, seized upon this third justification for denial of the Government's priority and that justification arises out of the language in Article 14 of the participation agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.643" offset="3129971">The Court of Appeals was of the view that since the United States under this loss ratable provision and participation agreement would have to as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out, turn over $3000 of the $12,000 it would recoup if its priority were recognized, it would have to turn over $3000 to that $12,000 to the private bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.991" offset="3207293">The Court of Appeals felt that this violated some long standing principle of interpretation under 3466, namely, that the United States was in effect collecting by exercising its right to priority for the benefit of a private party.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.764" offset="3386389">The -- the agreement does provide that -- that parties shall share ratably or proportionately.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.011" offset="3411466">All losses are sustained under the agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.845" offset="3422751">So I think irrespectively meant the bank recovered in the other from one hand of the amount that the United States Government recovered on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.549" offset="3453576">They would have to strike a balance and then a portion of the loss, 25% of the loss with the bank and three-fourths of the loss to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.072" offset="3491610">Now the -- the Court of Appeals, as I say, invoked the theory that since the United States at least impart had to turnover the part of the proceeds, it was going to recoup to the private bank that it was therefore not entitled to the priority established by 3466.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.879" offset="3570918">And the Court of Appeals in that connection relied, I think, exclusively on this Court's earlier decision in the Nathanson case, Nathanson against National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.934" offset="3607071">Now, I have time I think to -- two minutes to just briefly describe the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.820" offset="3626611">Tomorrow, I hope to be able to distinguish that case adequately but the facts in this case with which I would like to leave the Court this afternoon are simply these.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.399" offset="3668929">The -- in the Nathanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.376" offset="3680841">The National Labor Relations Board issued a backpay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.356" offset="3692753">It directed an employer of certain bus company up in Massachusetts to pay several thousands of dollars in backpay to some employees with respect to only the employer is guilty of an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.775" offset="3750431">The bus company was thrown into bankruptcy, and at that point, the Board filed a claim on behalf of all of the employees in who is in favor of the backpay award has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.960" offset="3795257">And it filed a claim under the Bankruptcy Act and it claimed the priority under 3466 and 64 -- Section 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act said that these claims should first be satisfied because of the Government's priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.339" offset="3852727">And this Court, I think quite properly in a case point that -- that after all, the whole underlying purpose of the federal priority statutes is to enable the federal government to secure it to any sufficient public revenue to sustain the public burden and to discharge the public debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.493" offset="3917302">And the Court pointed that quite naturally that any recovery or backpay in this bankruptcy proceeding were necessarily new or exclusively to the benefit of the employees in whose favor the backpay award has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.875" offset="3970905">And the -- the Court by putting those two concepts together, I think came up to the inevitable conclusion that since the priority in that case sought to be asserted on behalf by the National Labor Relations Board, on behalf of the employees with not a single penny, that priority have recognized whatever intuitive benefit of the Federal Treasury can never be used to sustain any part of the public burden.</text>
