            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.279" offset="120456">On the question of whether the government's ownership of the land makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.509" offset="145429">If secrets are added to government ownership of land, it still makes no difference, because there are as many secrets in private factories and laboratories as there are in governmental factories and laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.313" offset="212616">The security dangers are no different if the Navy builds a submarine in the Brooklyn Navy Yard or has it built by the General Dynamics Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.468" offset="265279">Secrecy cannot distinguish what happens off military bases and what happens on military bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.828" offset="302686">And if secrecy cannot make the difference, government ownership of the land alone, cannot be the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.392" offset="332988">And when one invokes secrecy in this case, it's a terrifyingly ironic thing, because we are talking about secrecy in a case where the employee who has been discharged is a short-order cook who has no access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.299" offset="400593">It seems to us that the -- at best, there is no issue of secrecy in this case, because the Government's interest in protecting military secrets can be preserved consistently with preserving the individuals interest in a hearing before he is discharged and stigmatized as a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.857" offset="490768">Nothing prevents summary exclusion of any employee from a military base or from any place else, pending a hearing on the charges against him with compensation for the lost time, if the charges are not shown to be substantiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.874" offset="562866">That gives the Government all it needs to protect its interest in secrecy and it gives the employee, the individual, what he needs to protect his interests against unconstitutional or arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.692" offset="626186">What this case then comes down to in terms of ownership of land, it seems to us, as the Government says, “it's the landlord”.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.947" offset="659205">Well, being the landlord does not permit a governmental officer to act without authority or to act unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.137" offset="699956">Being the landlord does not privilege depriving an employee of his job and stigmatizing him on the basis of no hearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.594" offset="749798">Being the landlord is just irrelevant to the invasion of the interests, which are here asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.197" offset="796191">I think we are right that on the basis of Greene v. McElroy, this case must be reversed without reaching any constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.371" offset="840808">But if this action in this case be authorized, we then have to face the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.272" offset="880410">Now, the Government's argument -- the respondent's argument, as I understand it under the Fifth Amendment, is that nothing was taken from Rachel Brawner which constitutes liberty or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.604" offset="929834">But clearly she had a job, she had employment opportunities, she had a reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.065" offset="955643">These were protectable interests, these are liberty or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.936" offset="975078">Clearly, these were invaded and so it seems to me, the only question that can exist is where they invaded without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.531" offset="1017501">In this case, there can be no such question because no process cannot conceivably be due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.498" offset="1061386">If we even grant that there was no liberty or property in terms of the job employment opportunities or reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.480" offset="1113318">We have to at least face also the denial of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.430" offset="1141112">On the issue of First Amendment rights, the Government has one footnote in its brief that tells us the contention is plainly without substance at page 59, note 35, and then it says, "Persons can without doubt, be excluded from military installations on the basis of speech or action, which maybe within the general area of the First Amendment, but which raises a suspicion that the person easily is or easily could become a security risk or even merely produces a lack of confidence in the person."</text>
            <text syncTime="303.546" offset="1317595">So confessedly, action adverse to the individual can be taken on the basis of the valid exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.159" offset="1363989">Now, if that does not involve a First Amendment right, I do not know how it can be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.101" offset="1391783">And more than that, the claim is that a First Amendment right, adverse action can be taken upon the basis of its exercise, with no hearing at all and altogether summary an ex parte determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.826" offset="1450715">You cannot even show that what was thought to be said was in fact, not said.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.263" offset="1472449">You cannot even show that what was said, does not reasonably give rise to a suspicion or to a lack of confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.703" offset="1506200">Well, if this is the procedure and we are told that this is it, then it seems to us that nobody can be safe against condemnation as a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.002" offset="1551339">He's not even safe even then, unless he reads nothing except banalities, talks about nothing except anonymities, associates with nobody about who an eyebrow can be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.789" offset="1602539">If this does not abridged First Amendment rights, we do not know what can and if this can be done without a hearing, we do not know how much more at least by contemporary methods, one can bring governmental action into collision with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.142" offset="1675891">I close with the questions that Rachel Brawner asked, what about security?</text>
            <text syncTime="405.384" offset="1724897">I haven't did anything, I don't know anything I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.868" offset="1746840">What must I do or who do I see?</text>
            <text syncTime="415.739" offset="1766379">I do not think that in this country, Rachel Brawner can be turned away with the answer, "You don't have to be told about your security when we bring it in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.481" offset="1813295">There is nothing you can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.983" offset="1823326">There is nobody you can see."</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="439.528" offset="1861465">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.541" offset="1885497">In this case, more than in most, the formulation of the question affects the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.662" offset="1922069">If we accept Mr. Dunau's phraseology that the issue here is whether Mrs. Brawner's employment could be terminated on security grounds without notice or hearing or a chance to explain, it's difficult to distinguish this case from Greene against McElroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.019" offset="1999496">If on the other hand, we accept the formulation which was adopted by the court below, that the case merely involves the authority of military commanders to determine the right of access of visitors to their installations, are the caused of transfer of persons out a sensitive area, most of the serious problems in the case disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.410" offset="2105031">But actually, the facts in the case are not in dispute and so we don't really advance our argument too much by adopting one phraseology or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.191" offset="2152155">What we need to do is to keep in mind precisely, what authority the authorities were tempting -- the officers were attempting to exercise and what rights of the petitioner were directly and indirectly acted upon by that exercise of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.934" offset="2235120">Before I get to the facts of the particular case, it seems to me that it's appropriate to say a word about the nature of the Gun Factory itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.676" offset="2278066">It covers a large area or about 125 acres which are developed -- which are devoted to the development, in the testing and the actual manufacture of Naval Weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.313" offset="2332609">Historically, all of the large Cauwenbergh cannons for war vessels were manufactured there.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.112" offset="2371793">This has given away in the present time to -- largely to the manufacture and development of guided missile launching mechanisms, which are incredibly complicated, mechanical and electronic installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.671" offset="2442010">But the variety of work done in the Gun Factory goes beyond cannons or -- or guided missile launching systems, with here for example that the -- the Norden bomb -- bombsight was developed and actually manufactured over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.052" offset="2511600">At the time Mrs. Brawner was there and before and after, there's been a good deal of work with nuclear weapons and nuclear work done in the Gun Factory grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.809" offset="2558621">It is on the warps of the -- at the gun -- within the confines of the -- of the weapons plant that the presidential yachts presently burr.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.932" offset="2603133">And in an area, immediately adjoining the area where Mrs. Brawner worked, she worked in what was called the Bellevue Annex, which is separated slightly geographically from the rest of the Gun Factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.094" offset="2667708">Right immediately adjacent to the -- to this annex, is what is called the Navy experimental laboratory I believe, separated only by a gate which is opened at the time when employees go back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.527" offset="2721520">And then the experimental laboratory, there is, for example at the present time nuclear reactor and experimental reactor, which is in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.177" offset="2760077">I -- I'd say this because I think we should bear in mind that I don't think anyone can question that this is an installation where the public interest requires careful control of methods of access in order to protect the safety of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.602" offset="2825801">Now, since Mrs. Brawner was employed in a cafeteria on these premises, it was necessary for her to receive a badge, a -- a laminated -- its actually a laminated piece of -- piece of plastic which he hanged -- hung on by a chain around her neck, which enabled her to go on the premises and so that anyone could see that she had a right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.172" offset="2940008">In order to get this badge, the time she originally came to work, she was taken before the Security Officer and she filled out a form in which she told what her -- whether she had a police record and two or three other questions it's in -- it's in the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.556" offset="3005628">And on the basis of this short examination, she was given this badge, which is the kind of badge which is carried by employees of sponsored activities, they have different colors of badges and this one shows that she is working for a -- for the cafeteria rather than being an employee of the Gun Factory directory -- directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.101" offset="3415751">And he called up the Board of -- directed of the Board which ran the cafeteria, wherein Board called up the M &amp; M -- office of the M &amp; M Cafeterias which was in the Gun Plant and told them that they should take away her badge because she was no longer entitled to -- to use it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.523" offset="8985475">The first question then is a question of authority, whether the command -- the commandant and the Security Officer had authority to impose the security system, to require her to have a badge, to take away the badge, if they feel and felt that she was not a safe person on -- on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.895" offset="9074918">We set forth in our appendix at page 91, the general statutes which in -- which give to the Secretary of the Navy, one custody of the property of the Navy, until to give him authority to make regulations with respect to its preservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.243" offset="9148374">This is a general authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.759" offset="9154435">It's in the most general terms that this -- that this general authority was intended to cover regulations dealing with access to naval property, is given weight by the provision in the Criminal Code which is cited on page 92 of our brief, which makes it a crime for anyone to go on any military, naval or cost guard reservation post, fort, arsenal yard and so forth, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation, which I take it as a recognition of the prior-given authority to make regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.215" offset="9300198">So that, I think that as far as Congress is concerned, it would be almost inconceivable that they wouldn't give the Navy power to deny people access to the -- to their property, but in fact, they have specifically done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.134" offset="9355891">We go from the authority which is found in the statutes to the authority and the regulations and that is cited on page 92, 93, 94 of our brief and this is in the general Navy Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.105" offset="9411793">And again, this is in general terms, but it imposes the obligation to preserve the safety of activities upon the "commanding officer."</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.636" offset="9461948">This is found in Article 0701.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.846" offset="9478771">And then in 0733, the commanding officer is given the responsibility for -- for the control of visitors to the activities of his activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.670" offset="9534046">And immediate below that, we find the specific regulation with respect to the admittance of dealers, tradesman or their agents, which I take it includes people like cafeterias, who are selling food to the people on the -- on the -- in the installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.050" offset="9619623">And as I say, this regulation is the regulation which gave the commanding officer of the Gun Factory the authority to give and take away the right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.035" offset="9663509">Now, he could have done this I suppose, by going himself to the gate or sending an officer to the gate and as each person came in, he could've look at the man and said, "You can come in and you can go out," on whatever basis he thought was reasonable, but this wouldn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.262" offset="9720456">I mean, people who are coming in regularly and going out regularly, you don't want to have to screen them each time and it's the -- under the regular manuals and I think the manuals are somewhat different from the regulations, because they're really instructions to the officers how they carry out these duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.221" offset="9784299">Their internal housekeeping devices that tell the -- tell the commanders what they should do, how they could carry out their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.583" offset="9825677">They'd suggest in there that method of access to -- to a controlled area should be through badges of this kind and it was under the general authority and the instruction in the manuals that the commanding officer in this case made Mrs. Brawner sign the application when she came in, gave her the badge and took it away when he felt that she no longer -- that she no longer fulfill the requirements which entitled her to have a badge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.546" offset="9953573">In connection with -- with the -- going on to Government -- to military property and going off, there's a long history of this being done at the discretion of the commanding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.977" offset="10019297">I say this, because in the Greene case, when we were discussing authority, when the Court discussed the authority to impose the regulations which were there involved, they found that there should be a specific authorization to give or to take away security clearance without the right of confrontation of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.523" offset="10121488">It was -- it was felt that if there was an intention to give that power to take away clearance without confrontation of witnesses that this should be specifically spelled out and that was the basis on which this Court said that there was no authority to issue the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.904" offset="10190973">Now, the entire history of the handling of people going on military reserve -- reservations from as far back as I can find, is been handled without a hearing or without a right to confront accusers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.317" offset="10260668">It's been done on a -- on a basis of the discretion of the commanding officer to the persons to whom he gives that -- gives the -- the delegates the authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="4138.437" offset="16657115">I confess to some bewilderment at the notion that the Government in this case did not directly affect the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.276" offset="16696508">Under the concessionaire agreement, the agreement provided that the concessionaire will not engage or continue to engage an employee who is found by the Security Officer not to meet security requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.412" offset="16760978">How much more directly can a job be affected, than by ordering the employee not to continue to engage for that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.401" offset="16800998">On the notion that this employee has the slightest chance of getting a job in any government cafeteria, every application for employment must disclose your previous employer and why you changed employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.264" offset="16860453">Now, if this woman went to the Nat Catering Corporation, which runs the cafeterias at the Pentagon and said, "One of my former employers was M &amp; M at the Gun Factory and I have to leave there, because I did not meet security requirements."</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.208" offset="16928162">It would be a very lengthy to suppose that that employee would be employed by the Nat Catering Corporation and the same is true of the General Services Incorporated, which operates restaurants in all governmental facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.832" offset="16994722">There has been an expression here that these manuals confer authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.762" offset="17026382">We, in our brief at length, show why these manuals even departmentally do not confer any authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.918" offset="17059088">For example, the statement in those manuals that a visitor constitutes an employee who is a contractor personnel or a contractor's employee, that does not refer to a contractor employee who works on the governmental premises, that refers to a contractor employee who works on his own employers premises and has occasion to visit a governmental installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.759" offset="17174444">That is made perfectly clear it seems to us, by the 1958 Manual, which says with respect to contractor employees, under the visitor classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.780" offset="17234526">I read from page 50 of our brief, "Department of Defense contractors desiring to have an employee, visit an activity of the naval establishment involving access to classified information, have been instructed to address a request in writing, directly to the commanding officer of the activity to be visited."</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.691" offset="17318118">Certainly, employees of contractors are contractor employees and they may have occasion to visit a naval establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.746" offset="17354376">They are then visitors which you cannot say that contractor employees who worked throughout their working ties on governmental premises are therefore visitors within a meaning of this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.254" offset="17400351">Now, assuming you could even get by this regulation, I want to add one other thought to which we've devoted our time in our brief, these were not published in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.664" offset="17442043">They are therefore void for that very reason, if only makes use a locative for the failure to publish any of these materials is that we are told, they relate solely to the internal management of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.503" offset="17505364">Well, how can something relate solely to the internal management of an agency when the consequence of applying the procedure supposed to be authorized by this, is the cause a private employee to loose her private employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.373" offset="17560848">That thus, certainly, does not relate solely to the internal management of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.412" offset="17584985">The Administrative Procedure Act, the legislative history of it, with respect to that exception says, "We are talking about matters of housekeeping detail.</text>

            <text syncTime="4426.974" offset="17811310">Let's see what this employer says with respect to Mrs. Brawner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.657" offset="17846000">We're told that, "She's an unsafe employee, she might do something physically wrong there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.141" offset="17863973">She might break dishes presumably."</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.650" offset="17874004">Well, this is what her employer says with respect to Mrs. Brawner as an employee and the safety in terms of physical safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.338" offset="17912769">He says, I'll read from page 62 of the record, "Mrs. Brawner and I discussed it and I have never had any question about her ability or qualifications and I pointed out to her at that time and there was no question about her work and she was satisfactory so far as the company was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.765" offset="17998451">And I told her that I regretted to having to do such a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.356" offset="18012766">After all, like many of our employees, she had problems at different times, that she would come to me at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.812" offset="18042650">And actually we had come in contact with her throughout the day at different times in connection with her work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.703" offset="18066160">And I can say, we had no question of her ability or qualifications to do the job."</text>

            <text syncTime="4566.876" offset="18370853">For example, suppose this employee was discharged or for security clearance was questioned because she was a Jew or because she was a Negro, no one would doubt that this was a denial of substantive due process but no one could know that there was a denial of substantive due process on -- until procedural due process refers the court in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.828" offset="18478686">And so, if and that decisions of this Court in (Inaudible) and in Wieman and the dictum in -- in the Mitchell case, clearly indicate that even as to governmental employees, there are certain things you cannot do to such employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.640" offset="18541902">You cannot discharge her for invoking the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.100" offset="18559770">You cannot discharge them for innocent membership or knowing membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.899" offset="18582967">Well, if you cannot do that to them, you cannot protect them, unless they first get procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.220" offset="18608253">You must first know what is being done before you can know whether there's something that could be done about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.986" offset="18631346">Now, in the Government's brief there is a suggestion, that's voters are not life or liberty and property here for the purpose of substantive due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="4644.206" offset="18680247">Whether there's any primacy between the two, it's procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.361" offset="18696861">You cannot know what is happening until you are told what is happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.028" offset="18743463">Perhaps, this should not belabor the distinction between Mrs. Brawner as a cook and Mr. Greene as an aeronautical engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.023" offset="18791424">But there was another case here when Greene was here, Taylor v. McElroy was here, that was dismissed as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.745" offset="18830399">Taylor was a lathe operator and a tool and die maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.732" offset="18850252">Well, this Court mootness of aside, have decided Taylor -- decided Taylor differently than it decided Greene, because Taylor was a tool and a die maker and Greene was an aeronautical engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.435" offset="18901138">And at those two cases mootness aside had gone the same way, are we now to draw distinctions between cooks and lathe operators?</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.657" offset="18933948">It seems to us that this sort of thing just is a -- a kind of a fairyland detour.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.041" offset="18963519">We have employees here who are injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.781" offset="18974490">Mrs. Greene was injured certainly enough to make it almost an insulting relevance -- irrelevancy to ask whether she was injured more than William Greene.</text>
