            <text syncTime="25.305" offset="204570">This case now before you, Frank Wilkinson versus the United States, you have already heard considerable about in the argument earlier today.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.115" offset="259845">I will not burden the Court by repetition of that argument except insofar as the Court desires or it becomes pertinent to the case of Frank Wilkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.329" offset="316688">Frank Wilkinson was indicted under 2 U.S.C. 192 for contempt to the Congress for refusal to answer a single question.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.847" offset="378755">So his case is simplified by the fact that there is only a single count upon which the court below ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.001" offset="423372">Frank Wilkinson had been subpoenaed to appear before a Subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities Committee in Atlanta in July of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.986" offset="495365">This Committee had, as its directive from the full Committee, the Subcommittee, three purposes to investigate colonizing activities of the Communist Party in textile and other industry in the South, investigation of dissemination of foreign political propaganda in the South, and investigation of Communist propaganda activity in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.982" offset="655339">Mr. Wilkinson was subpoenaed according to the statement of the counsel for the Committee, on page 30 of the record and on page 156 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.390" offset="756903">Page 156 of the record is a testimony -- the hearing -- the report of the hearings by the House Committee and the 156 number is down in the lower right hand corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.803" offset="818552">It is information of the Committee and the suggestion of the Committee said, "Mr. Arens, that in anticipation of the hearings here in Atlanta, Georgia, you were set to this area by the Communist Party for the purpose of developing a hostile sentiment to the Committee and to its work and for the purpose of undertaking to bring pressure upon the United States Congress to preclude these particular hearings."</text>

            <label>Mr. Rowland Watts</label>
            <text syncTime="232.522" offset="1033488">Now, there was no suggestion at any time in the testimony of any witness before these particular hearings that Mr. Wilkinson had any knowledge of any of the stated activities for which the subcommittee was authorized to conduct hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.690" offset="1134111">On the contrary, there was no indication whatsoever that Mr. Wilkinson had ever been in the South at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.893" offset="1178937">Now, Mr. Arens stated that he was not -- Mr. Wilkinson was not subpoenaed to appear until the Committee had knowledge that he was in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.672" offset="1230033">I suggest on internal evidence that this was somewhat inaccurate because that's a matter of fact, Mr. Wilkinson was served with a subpoena on July 23rd within an hour after he arrived in Atlanta and that is shown on page 40 of the record, the testimonies of the marshal.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.611" offset="1349778">And the subpoena was dated the preceding day in Washington, DC.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.058" offset="1379558">Therefore, we suggest that while it is not serious that Mr. Arens slipped on that point, it is clearly indicative of the fact that the Committee subpoenaed Mr. Wilkinson before it had any knowledge whatsoever that he was in the South at all, and as a matter of fact before he actually was in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.893" offset="1502960">Therefore, it was not possible for the Committee to consider within the framework of its three stated purposes, any testimony by Mr. Wilkinson, and in answer to a parallel question if concerning Mr. Braden this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.078" offset="1587702">There is no testimony in the hearing by any member of the Committee or by anyone else that the Committee had any information that Mr. Wilkinson had any relationship to the Communist Party except the testimony, the statement of Mr. Arens, Committee Chairman himself to the effect that they had such testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.696" offset="1710164">Now, all of the witnesses that appeared before the Committee prior to the appearance of Mr. Wilkinson, and we conceded that Mr. Wilkinson was present throughout the hearings, heard the opening statement of the Subcommittee Chairman, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.136" offset="1787904">All the preceding witnesses testify those concerning matter that had some relationship to the purpose of the Subcommittee's hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.165" offset="1847986">Mr. Penha, a favorable witness to the Government, testified, as you heard this morning, in identical fashion to what he had testified in Boston earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.345" offset="1896782">That he -- about the general purported colonizing efforts of the Communist Party in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.642" offset="1933981">The other favorable witness to the Committee, Mr. Fishman, testified as he had testified throughout the country many times before concerning the great influx of allegedly foreign political propaganda from abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.642" offset="2017991">The other witnesses, and I have summarized what each proceeding one said in our brief, testified to and/or refused to testify to an unidentified paper called the Southern Newsletter and there was some collateral information.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.833" offset="2110673">But at no point, was there any testimony concerning Mr. Wilkinson's activities and there was no indication that he was either a Communist or that he'd ever been to South before.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.474" offset="2169292">Or there was no indication that he had any information pertinent to this Subcommittee's mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.310" offset="2200639">Now, Mr. Wilkinson refused to answer this question and several others on the basis that he considered the mandate of the House Un-American Activities Committee, in proper, violative of the First Amendment and that he was under no obligation to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.777" offset="2302516">On -- on contrary, in support of the Constitution and in support of conscience, he was under obligation to refuse to answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.815" offset="2710653">Now, regardless of Mr. Wilkinson's error in failing to anticipate this court's decision in Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.817" offset="2774601">This Court said in Barenblatt that the mandate of the House Committee had achieved sufficient definiteness because of the persuasive gloss of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.464" offset="2841266">Now, that maybe true but there is no gloss of legislative or any other history that can justify the extending of the limited mandate given to Subcommittee to include the investigation of a man because he is carrying on a public campaign in opposition to the Committee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.499" offset="2965400">As Mr. Arens said, "to induce the Congress to prevent these hearings, these particular hearings from being held."</text>
            <text syncTime="726.018" offset="3007404">The court below ruled that Barenblatt was controlling here, and it was controlling because the Congress had the power to legislate in the area of petitioning the Government for redress of grievance because it had the right to legislate in the area of the Lobbying Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.693" offset="3110118">And it supported United States versus Harris as controlling on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.870" offset="3142823">The court below further said something which is quite curious.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.827" offset="3166647">It said that Mr. Wilkinson, in carrying on his campaign to induce the Congress to abolish the Un-American Activities Committee, was carrying on an activity that was more -- a greater threat to the security of the country than that charged to Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.800" offset="3266539">I don't think that obviously, it wasn't controlling but I think that it points up the approach to this problem made by the court below and the error in the approach made by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.130" offset="3323904">This Court said in Harris through Mr. Chief Justice Warren that the Lobbying Act must be very narrowly construed as was done there to avoid the constitutional dangers of the First Amendment and the Lobbying Act is very -- the word lobbying was carefully defined to mean direct communication with members of the Congress concerning legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.494" offset="3465383">However, it specifically excluded, as I understand it, a public campaign to induce members of Congress to abolish one of its own Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.632" offset="3569873">I suggest to the Court and unless the Court wants me to repeat, I will not repeat what has been said this morning that it is unnecessary to reconsider Barenblatt in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.314" offset="3640613">This case is very simple factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.001" offset="3659421">The Government in its brief has suggested that Mr. Willis, the acting Subcommittee Chairman, after Wilkinson had refused to testify, said that one of one of the purposes of a those hearings was to investigate the alleged reorganization of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.363" offset="3772792">Now, this had never been suggested before and the Government sets forth in its brief this as one of the purposes for which these particular hearings were being held, and the Government suggests that the Subcommittee can change its own mandate within the framework of the whole mandate of the Committee anytime it wants to in the course of any particular hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.770" offset="3874461">Now, if this suggestion is correct, there is absolutely no authority, no control over a Committee by the Subcommittee or in terms by the Congress over Committee, and I think that this clearly -- this suggestion clearly should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.858" offset="3966830">There is nothing in the record to justify the upholding of this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.024" offset="4007476">There is nothing in the record in my opinion to support the opinion of the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.519" offset="4085426">Before getting into the particular facts of the Wilkinson testimony, I would like to just briefly refer to the testimony of Mr. Penha at these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.987" offset="4139342">Now, Mr. Penha had previously testified before the Committee in Boston and I have a recollection of reading in this record, although I was unable to find it during luncheon recess, an explanation that during the Boston hearings, Mr. Penha made reference to this Communist Party colonization program in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.884" offset="4242892">He referred to that and told the Committee about that during the Boston hearings but he did not go into detail in the Boston hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.694" offset="4274134">The Committee was investigating activities in that area, not in the South, at the occasion of the Boston testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.199" offset="4316139">Now, Mr. Penha, in these hearings, testified that he had been a member of the National Textile Commission of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.474" offset="4361279">During the time that he was a member of the Party and at the same time reporting to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the activities of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.501" offset="4393357">He testified that he had been sent as a member of the National Textile Commission into the South and that he had been instructed to and did contact various Communist Party members in this area and with respect to the colonization program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.165" offset="4472038">Many of the people who work all these witnesses in these hearings were people who, Mr. Penha stated, were Communist Party members whom he contacted on the occasion of this trip through the South on behalf of the National Textile Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.456" offset="5513174">Now, whether he testified to that in previous occasion, I couldn't say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.635" offset="5537938">He has, I understand as I say from newspaper articles, testified concerning the importation of foreign Communist propaganda into the United States generally in hearings before the Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.482" offset="5605334">What -- now, to get to the -- to the facts as to the -- as to the petitioner here, I might point out, at the outset, that this Court, in its opinion in the Watkins case, pointed out at the very beginning of that opinion that the Watkins case did not concern a truculent or a condemnations witness who had refused to answer all questions of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.423" offset="5765099">This, however, is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.339" offset="5776697">This witness appeared before the Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.187" offset="5792162">He testified that he had come in response to a subpoena, he gave his name, and then when he was asked for his residence address, he stated as a matter of conscience and personal responsibility, I refuse to answer any questions of this Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.241" offset="5876381">He was then advised of his right to counsel if he would like counsel there and he said, “He did not choose to have counsel”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.797" offset="5910549">The next question he was asked, and this is at page 155 of the record, 2681 of the Committee print.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.400" offset="5949001">The question was, “Mr. Wilkinson, are you now a member of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.237" offset="5972302">His reply was, “As a matter of conscience and personal responsibility, I refuse to answer any questions of this Committee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.671" offset="6006053">It is – it is a refusal to answer that question and that question only that the indictment here was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.898" offset="6038967">Now, after he had refused, the Staff Director explained, went through an elaborate explanation consisting of about one and a half pages of the record, explaining to him the twofold responsibility of the Committee and the purpose why the Committee was conducting these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.904" offset="6110960">And on the next page of the record, at 156, is the text of the Staff Director's explanation of the Committee's interest in informing itself of Communist Party activities in this particular area with a view to enabling the Committee intelligently to make recommendations on pending legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.658" offset="6210017">There was a particular reference in Mr. Arens' explanation to H.R. 9937, which was an omnibus bill which had been introduced in the Congress by the Chairman of the full Committee Mr. Willis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.870" offset="6290892">Well, it's -- it was a bill generally covering of a number of internal security statutes but it covers a variety of different statutes and amendments to statutes, for example, it would amend the Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.639" offset="6369886">It would also have amended the Smith Act to define the word “organized” as used in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.699" offset="6406144">I think it covered some for the passport procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.866" offset="6426833">It would have amended some of the espionage statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.829" offset="6446686">In other words, it was a bill covering a variety of internal security statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.251" offset="6484407">Now, he also explained that it was the Committee's information that he was a hardcore member of the Communist Party and then he was designated by the Communist Party for the purpose of creating and manipulating certain organizations including the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, and then he had been sent into the South for Communist purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.461" offset="6621184">And he then stated that it was the information of the Committee that in anticipation of the hearings here in Atlanta, you were sent to this area by the Party, I'm paraphrasing trying to shorten the quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.630" offset="6669876">This is at page 156 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.266" offset="6684400">"In anticipation in hearings here in Atlanta, you were sent to this area by the Party for the purpose of developing a hostile sentiment to this Committee and to its work for the purpose of undertaking to bring pressure upon the Congress to preclude these particular hearings."</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.970" offset="6739257">And then Mr. Arens said, "Indeed it was a fact you were not even subpoenaed for these particular hearings until we learned that you were in town."</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.080" offset="6763708">That apparently was an inadvertency, it should have been that you were coming to town, because he was subpoenaed, as was pointed out earlier, about a week prior to his appearance before the Committee and almost a week prior to his checking in at the Atlanta hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.653" offset="6834030">The Committee Chairman then, in further explanation of the pertinency of the questions, said that before he was -- he would direct the witness to answer that he would also like to make a further explanation of pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.052" offset="6895574">And this is at page 157 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.964" offset="6915218">And the Committee Chairman, Mr. Willis said that, "We have held hearings."</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.467" offset="6937266">He was referring to a pending bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.087" offset="6947715">"We have held hearings on it just a couple of weeks ago on the question of the organizational features of the Communist conspiracy."</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.292" offset="6976554">Specifically, the Supreme Court, in what it popularly referred to as the Yates case, held that the Communist Party must be regarded as having been organized in 1945, and automatically all prosecutions for organizational features have been destroyed and no more prosecution is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.713" offset="7042173">He then states that the Committee was therefore interested for -- that among other reasons for pertinency of these hearings, would be the development of information which we feel you have, sir, that you could shed a light on the current methods of organizing, or regrouping, or reconstructing of the Party and subdivisions thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.222" offset="7144260">So that Mr. Willis made it clear to him that in connection with that legislation that would have defined or would define, if it's ever passed, would define the meaning of the word “organized” as used in the Smith Act, which was the part of the subject of this Court's opinion in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.875" offset="7222836">And he's asking the witness to testify as to what he can tell them about the current organizational methods of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.633" offset="7261915">Now, Mr. Wilkinson again refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.179" offset="7272051">The Chairman directed that he answer the question and he refused on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.217" offset="7296188">The Committee also pointed out to him and this appears at page 158, and Mr. Arens, the Staff Director, read from a Committee transcript of hearings that it had earlier held in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.122" offset="7351881">I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.924" offset="7363062">From the testimony of a witness, Anita Schneider, who testified and identified Mr. Wilkinson as a member of the Communist Party and is having had an influence in a front organization in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.196" offset="7452191">The name with which she -- I think – it was the Citizens Committee to Preserve American Freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.531" offset="7477478">And despite that information, Mr. Wilkinson persisted in his refusal, completely adamant refusal to cooperate at all or to answer any questions of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.279" offset="7528469">He was later on asked to identify a photo static copy of his registration at the hotel in Atlanta which showed that he listed his business firm as the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.955" offset="7607150">Oh, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.684" offset="7610075">Oh yes, he refused to answer that and to identify the document and he refused to identify whether or not he had made certain telephone calls from the hotel, which were reflected in a list of hotel phone calls that were received by subpoena from the hotel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.007" offset="7715401">And he was also asked, "Are you now the principle driving force, the leader, of the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.230" offset="7736299">And he refused to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.444" offset="7745181">Now, for the first question, “Are you a member of the Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.182" offset="7760123">And these two latter questions, he was cited by the Congress -- he was indicted on the first question only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.462" offset="7801187">Now, we think on these facts, of course, no Fifth Amendment problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.773" offset="7834415">That this case is clearly governed by this Court's decisions in the Watkins case and in the Barenblatt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.126" offset="7871927">The question here was a direct question as to the witnesses' present membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.685" offset="7898154">The -- the evidence we think is overwhelming that the purpose for this witnesses being called before the Subcommittee was not because of the fact that he had engaged in activities aimed at abolishing the Committee, but rather the statement of the Staff Director that he had been subpoenaed when they learned that he had come into the South on behalf of the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee to conduct or to hinder the conduct of these hearings, that that was an explanation of the occasion for his being subpoenaed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.204" offset="8080175">The -- the Committee Chairman in the opening statement at these hearings had made a statement that the Committee had learned that the Communist Party had been controlling its activities in the South through the importation from other areas, from Northern areas particularly, the importation of Northern Communist agents into the South to control the Communist activities in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.983" offset="8203264">Here, the Committee had information that Mr. Wilkinson who it had reason to believe was a Communist, had been sent into the South on Communist business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.432" offset="8245060">We think that clearly, the Committee had a right to subpoena him, to ask him the question as to whether he was a member of the Party, and to solicit information from him as to what he could tell the Committee of current organizational activities of the Party and the propaganda activities of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.891" offset="8330951">Now, the Court of Appeals in its decision, stated that "In its view, the case was covered by the Barenblatt decision and that it -- that included him the pervasive authority," and this is at page 69 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.482" offset="8445262">"Included in the pervasive authority of this Committee is the power to investigate activities directed to interference with the legislative processes and their function."</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.498" offset="8485386">The Court then concluded that since this was an area in which Congress could legislate, citing the Harris case that the Committee had a proper legislative purpose and that the inquiry was authorized --</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.058" offset="13835577">Your -- Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.102" offset="13839757">So on the question of these traveling witnesses, I refer you to the hearings of Communist activity in New -- in the New England area published by the House Un-American Activities, March 18th, 1958, or a testimony was taken on that date in which Mr. Penha at page 21, 28, and thereabouts in following, discussed, at great lengths, the colonizing efforts of the Communist Party in the South specifically in North and South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.416" offset="14065037">Concerning Mr. Fishman, I refer you to page 112 of the record in which the only reference to foreign political activity -- propaganda activity in the South is Mr. Arens, “Tell us, if you please, sir, what type of mail this is which comes into the Southern States?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.579" offset="14189693">Then Mr. Fishman gives the general testimony he'd given many times before and says, "Areas this like the State of Georgia."</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.825" offset="14234624">And then later, he says, "Does it also go into Alabama and Mississippi?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.194" offset="14256149">And he says, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.927" offset="14263045">The only thing that has any possible bearing on the South is the statement in passing the percentage of material sent here is far less than it is in some of the northern states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.634" offset="14321873">Now, I suggest that that was not very worthwhile testimony to bring Mr. Fishman down from New York to give in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.474" offset="14361266">As far as Mr. Wilkinson is concerned, the Committee practically treats him like a traveling witness also, because in fact, he had been subpoenaed and appeared before the Committee 18 months previously in Los Angeles, was asked, basically the same question and gave, basically the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.316" offset="14472652">I suggest that there was no occasion for bringing Mr. Wilkinson subpoenaing him at Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.416" offset="14517060">The Government suggests that he was subpoenaed there because it was a matter of convenience they discovered in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.752" offset="14550392">But what they wanted to ask him about was his activities against the Committee itself in his public campaign against the Committee himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.991" offset="14575365">And the Committee has not hesitated to call people all the way across -- from all the way across the country if they wanted them to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.321" offset="14628655">Mr. Fishman, in his trips about the country with the Committee, testified twice in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.000" offset="14667421">I think it is clear that Wilkinson was not subpoenaed for anything that had to do with the mandate of the Subcommittee, the authorization of the Subcommittee.</text>

            <text syncTime="4036.810" offset="16250650">One of them was this Bill 9937, the so-called Omnibus Bill that the House was going -- that the Un-American Activities Committee was going to put through Congress but it never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.099" offset="16319718">This Bill was summarized in part, in major part on page 19 and 20 of the record by Mr. Arens on direct examination at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.771" offset="16374471">Now, with all of these provisions in this Omnibus Bill, not one of them referred to any suggestion that the law being an Act should be changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4084.390" offset="16440926">Also, what they were talking about was an amendment to the Smith Act to redefine the word “organized” in the light of this Court's decision in Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.082" offset="16503724">However, that particular Bill was not before the House Un-American Activities Committee but was before the House of Judiciary Committee and hearings were held on it, and the Judiciary Committee did vote it out, report it out that a week after these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.670" offset="16626082">And it passed the House on August 12th, 1958.</text>
