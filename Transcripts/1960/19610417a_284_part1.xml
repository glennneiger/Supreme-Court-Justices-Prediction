            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, Petitioner, versus National Labor Relations Board et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.215" offset="144280">Mr. Morris.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles J. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="14.015" offset="159431">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.951" offset="183150">This case poses a question to the Court as to whether or not, a union and an employer committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 8 (a) (2) as to the employer in Section 8 (b) (1) (A) as to the union if and when an exclusive recognition contract is entered into absent the existence of a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.894" offset="286908">Such contract was entered into in this case, and this is very much part of the question posed to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.628" offset="313866">Absent a dual union situation, there was no rival union, absent union security provisions or other forms of coercion either individual incidents of coercion or implicit coercion within the contract itself and also absent a union dominated and controlled by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.773" offset="402474">Further at issue in this case is that this contract was entered into and was the settlement of a strike which had been in existence for more than a month and further, this contract was entered into when the parties, in good faith, believed that they are in fact existed a majority of the employees who had authorized the union by signing cards as their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.832" offset="510725">The facts of the case require us to go back to the fall of 1956 at which time the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was organizing employees of a nonunion rather large manufacturer of ladies cashmere sweaters in San Antonio, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.360" offset="584808">The organizing was slow, and the record will show that during the period of about 10 months, a little over 100 cards were signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.513" offset="625455">And during that period of time, the union increased its strength but something happened, as frequently occurs in labor incidents, which trigger the organizational effort and that was the employer granted a wage decrease to some of his skilled employees and the knitting department of his factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.831" offset="714689">This triggered a strike which the union supported and backed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.081" offset="731721">During the period of -- of the strike, which lasted for a little more than a month, the union continued its organizational efforts and more employees signed cards and toward the end of that period, the -- the strike began on the 27th of July, 1957, you see, about 10 months after the organizing had started.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.056" offset="811551">Toward the end of that period, toward the end of July, the union representative received a call to come to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.315" offset="836629">He did and took with him two of the employees who brought the cards with him and after five days of very intensive negotiations, this strike, which obviously was difficult of settlement because it was settled at the very toppish lines of the company and the very toppish pf lines of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.012" offset="907368">It was settled at the office and with the assistance of the International President, David Dubinsky and the Vice President of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.814" offset="1034637">It was supported there -- it is undisputed that it was supported by the union in -- in every respect and continued as part of the union's organizational campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.476" offset="1073298">It was not an organizational strike -- strike that.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.805" offset="1090644">It was not a strike for recognition, certainly in its inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.208" offset="1104227">There is a stipulation in the record that the strike was in protest of the reduction in wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.878" offset="1130872">Now, as of the time toward the end of that strike, and this brings me to the next crucial fact here, toward the end of that strike, in New York, the union representative was getting a running count of the cards which had been signed up and at the point where it appeared, based upon representations made by the employer as to the number of employees in the probable unit, at that point, the union requested recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.652" offset="1229928">And one might say that as of them, it was a strike for recognition.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.775" offset="1754467">In addition, it was pointed out toward the conclusion of the strike that the disruption of production had been so great that the employer requested of the union a waiver as to certain clauses and the ultimate contract as to overtime on weekends and asked permission to work its Knitting Department 24 hours around the clock on a seven-day basis operating on a four-shift basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.055" offset="1959581">The -- but to carry on with what I started to say, Your Honor, about the inability of the parties to produce a payroll list, it is impossible to read this record, and it was impossible for the trial examiner and it has been impossible for the various board representatives and the Board itself in writing on this case to determine the exact number of people in the appropriate bargaining unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.310" offset="2092596">It's undisputed that as of the time the strike ended and the recognition was granted and a memorandum agreement on the 30th of August, 1957, the union had, in its possession, valid cards, valid in the sense has been employed by the company to the extent of 186.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.738" offset="2166366">It was -- because they had these 186 cards that the parties were under the impression that they did in fact have a majority as of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.671" offset="6786069">The record however shows that the General Counsel did not prove that a single person even knew that the kind of recognition was given was exclusive recognition that people were simply advised that the employer and the union had signed a contract, and this is all the record shows, except, it shows the contrary of the -- of the Board's contention, and that is, of these 63 people who had signed cards in the interim, a number were called as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.734" offset="6902262">They were available to the Board -- to the General Counsel for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.316" offset="6920652">And they testified that they understood, and they had been told by the employer that it didn't make any difference whether they joined the union or didn't join the union, they would get the same benefits anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.321" offset="8132629">I think it ought to be added as to the facts emphasized that the contract in this case did not have any union security clause of any kind and therefore, no employees were obligated or required to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.609" offset="8209847">Also that there was no rival union in the picture and finally that there is no possible contention that the union in question here was in anyway a dominated union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.597" offset="8261778">To the contrary, the evidence shows very clearly that this was a genuine arm's length transaction, and that the employer had been a bitter opponent of the union until the strike and the settlement which ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.108" offset="8315800">I think that some of the nutty questions which have been imposed here may perhaps be obviated all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.833" offset="8342653">If we look at one further factual point, which Mr. Morris has to some degree gone into but which I would like to emphasize a little more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.347" offset="8380792">On August the 30th, the strike settlement memorandum was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.475" offset="8413288">This appears in the record and it's just a very short document in which I had in hand and brought and it was provided in that document that within two weeks, counsel would get together and sign a formal agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.081" offset="8463653">Now, this -- the first document, the August 30th document, contained in very brief and summary form a statement "5% increase for the holidays and the other benefits" and one of the clauses said "exclusive recognition of the production and shipping employee".</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.743" offset="8526346">Between August the 30th and October 10th, which is more than the two-weeks counsel had anticipated, they finally got together and signed the formal agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.479" offset="8573262">But in that period of some six weeks, I guess, the union continued its organization campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.270" offset="8600430">As Mr. Morris indicated to you, workers knew and were told that it was stipulated in this record that they were under no coercion to join the union at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.620" offset="8637837">It was stipulated that they were told they would get the same benefits whether they did or did not join the union and there is a stipulation in the record --</text>

            <text syncTime="2241.882" offset="9070947">There is also a clause for exclusive recognition with a more -- with a similar elaboration of the wage terms and all the other customary collective bargaining terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.428" offset="9121102">Now, the -- I say that the whole case may conceivably be disposed of on the October 10th contract for this simple reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.170" offset="9156002">If, by that time, the union did have an uncoerced majority, I don't think it's a sufficient answer to do what the Board does in its brief to say, “Well, anybody knows, that's just a tainted fruit of the original August 30th contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.370" offset="9220890">That's how they got their majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.597" offset="9233742">The fact is that the Board in its decision by the way didn't even discuss the October 10th agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.690" offset="9270105">It did, in its order, knock it out, but it didn't have the slightest word of discussion about the contract, how it came about, whether it was free or unfree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.756" offset="9310438">The Board in its decision, in its brief now says, “Well, you held, the Supreme Court held in the Pennsylvania Greyhound case, back 20 odd years ago, that a union which gets exclusive recognition as a marked advantage over any of it in obtaining the allegiance of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.371" offset="9404897">What the Labor Board does intent, however, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.464" offset="9425272">First of all, in the Pennsylvania Greyhound case, you had a completely dominated union, and you had a rival union situation which you don't have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.787" offset="9462471">And there was a fight going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.402" offset="9473024">The real authority, which I think points to the correct result, is the Consolidated Edison case, which this Court decided a few years later and which much more clearly points to the result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.186" offset="9520149">In the Consolidated Edison case, the Court was cited to Pennsylvania Greyhound, rejected it as an authority and the Consolidated Edison, you find essentially this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.443" offset="9569155">There, the contract on its face, it is true, said that it was a contract for its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.759" offset="9598412">The -- the recognition clause said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.796" offset="9606562">And to that extent, it's different from our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.737" offset="9618369">But the economic terms was stated to apply to everybody in the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.854" offset="9642820">The contract there said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.559" offset="9653582">In that case, the employer was engaged in a rival union -- was in the middle of a rival union fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.317" offset="9680645">He favored this IBEW union, the AFL union over the CIO union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.498" offset="9705409">He engaged in various acts of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.778" offset="9718471">He engaged in -- in conduct which was later found to be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.471" offset="9741249">Nevertheless, when the Labor Board issued its order which set aside the IBEW contract, well, I forgot -- I should have added one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.690" offset="9786180">The -- the testimony in that case showed in the findings were, that although in terms it stated it was a “members only” agreement so far as recognition was concerned, the finding of the Board was that in fact it was an exclusive recognition contract that it had been so applied and so carried on, and the Supreme Court held the Board was wrong in setting aside such an agreement, that this agreement was not the fruit of the unfair labor practices and could not be presumed to be the fruit of the unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.693" offset="9934137">That the 30,000 people in that case who had selected the IBEW had some rights and some right stability of employment relations, and that despite the employer's unfair labor practices and despite the rival union situation, that contract should stand and not be set aside while the Board took its time in running a long continued election.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.262" offset="10464423">That the trial examiner believed that good faith meant that they had, from the information at hand at that time, a reasonable and honest belief that there was a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.532" offset="10509458">The record does show that Mr. (Inaudible), the union's regional director, knew the number of people for whom he had cards and knew the company statement of how many people there were in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.012" offset="10547388">And based upon one against the other, he thought that one was more than one half of the total.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.770" offset="10566405">And it was on that basis that the company and the union got together and signed the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.032" offset="10583542">Now, I -- I want to add this, that quite apart from anything else, we think that the word "exclusive" in that agreement had no -- in the first memorandum, the August 30th memorandum, had no real effect upon the realities of the employment relations in this plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.702" offset="10690226">As we read the Board decision originally, although I think the Board brief is now otherwise, we felt the Board decision meant that it was attacking all minority union bargaining that it was improper to have minority union bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.347" offset="10756786">And I would appreciate it if the Court would ask Mr. Manoli what position of the Board really is because in the Board brief now, as we read it, they say the only attack here is upon that clause, the exclusive clause and the only real penalty that will ensue say they chopped out the clause, the Board's order means nothing more than that -- that clause should be chopped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.712" offset="10866186">I want to come to the order at the tail of my argument, but the Board's order, may I say at this point, goes way beyond merely knocking out the exclusive clause but terminates the entire contract and leaves the employees without any contractual protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.615" offset="10917804">We -- we go through in our brief in some detail to show that minority union bargaining, certainly, without an exclusive clause, is certainly within the contemplation of the protection of the Act that Congress intended that it exist and that historically, minority union bargaining was perhaps the prevailing kind of bargaining in big industry at least for a number of years following the passage of the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.474" offset="11033266">That in auto and in steel and in rubber and other big industries, it took time before unions were able to secure majorities and during that period, there was a great deal of minority bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.330" offset="11096691">And we also say that it is essential to protect that right to minority union bargaining because otherwise, you may have strikes and considered activities by workers who have not yet secured a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.201" offset="11152175">And if they cannot settle their disputes and settle their strikes and be protected against discrimination while they are still a minority, I think we have a very serious en route upon the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.290" offset="11212570">We think it is certainly more desirable that employment terms be fixed in a plant by two, three, five or any number of -- of employees less than a half with the employer through genuine arm's length bargaining, then to have the employer do it unilaterally in a way which stated the Wagner repeatedly referred to in his -- in the record when the Wagner Act was first passed as the trade name for exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.699" offset="11334196">And therefore, we think that minorities do have the right to fix the terms of the bargain so long as there is no union security clause because the statute does expressly, in Section 8 (a) (3), prohibit a union security clause by a less majority group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.312" offset="11416639">But absent that and absent a rival union situation where the employer is applying this better treatment to one as against the other, and absent a creature of the company kind of union, we think it is perfectly proper to have minority union bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.268" offset="11484453">And while the Board in this case may or may not attack it, we think that in any event, this Court ought to make very clear that this is proper.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="3432.579" offset="13833697">Now, before I turn to the considerations which underlie this controversy, I think I should like to emphasize because despite certain acknowledges that have been made, nevertheless, I think that the two points had been blur if not obscure</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.488" offset="13909347">.The first is that the Board in this case found that the union did not represent a majority of the employees that were covered by this -- this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.953" offset="13951143">That finding was affirmed by the court below and despite the fact that the petitioners both in their brief as well as during the course of the oral argument have set up a sort of a variable smokes screen as to why the Board was wrong in making the calculations that it did that they're showing that it was a minority union, nevertheless, both in this brief and again in this Court, they have acknowledged, and I think this is the critical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.324" offset="14040691">They have acknowledged that this question of -- of the minority status of this union is not now before this Court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.836" offset="14070680">And so the starting point, our starting premises that this union did not represent a majority of the employees at the time that it was recorded exclusive recognition by this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.282" offset="14112475">And secondly, secondly, in the posture of this case, we are not concerned with the question of whether major -- or minority union can enter into a contract for its members only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.319" offset="14164616">Nor are we concerned with the suggestion that's been made here as well as in -- in the briefs of the parties that the minority union may negotiate for all of the employees in their unit as long as there is no explicit recognition of an exclusive representative status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.472" offset="14233266">Now, we think that the distinction is one with without a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.373" offset="14244864">But in any event, that is not this case, because in this case, in this case the employer did afford exclusive recognition to this union, and it did negotiate -- and this union did negotiate a contract covering all of the employees as their exclusive bargain representative at a time when this union did not represent a majority of those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.158" offset="14340054">Now, as Mr. Morris has said, the two principle questions that are presented in this case are first, whether the employers, whether recognition of a minority union has the exclusive representative of all of the employees in the unit whether that constitutes first on the part of the employer interferes and restraint with the exercise of Section 7 rights by the employees, illegal employer support of a labor organization in violation of the statute and second, whether it constitutes on the part of the union the acquisition of this exclusive representative status when it does not represent a majority employees, whether that acquisition on the part of the union constitutes restraint and coercion within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.677" offset="14526046">Now, I think the starting point of our analysis in this case here is a word about the collective bargaining mechanism of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.566" offset="14565648">The key feature, the key feature of that mechanism is the majority rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.719" offset="14602219">That provision, the majority of rule is incorporating the statute by virtue of Section 9 of the Act which provides that only a representative chosen by a majority of the employees and an appropriate bargaining unit may serve as the exclusive bargaining representative of the all of the employees in the unit, both the consenting majority as well as the non-consenting minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.253" offset="14696364">Under the statute, under the statute, only a majority union, one which has been designated by a majority of the employees, the unit has the plenary authority to speak for both the consenting majority as well as the non-consenting minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.491" offset="14749341">And under the statute, an employer is obligated to accord exclusive recognition to a -- an employee is representative only if, only if that representative has been chosen by a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.827" offset="14806706">Now, the majority rule principle is a common place of our political life, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.632" offset="14825932">And Congress, Congress adopted this majority rule principle on this statute in order to import into the arena of industrial relations and measure of democracy such as Barks Aaron political life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.121" offset="14875878">Now, consistent with this philosophy, consistent with this underlying philosophy, we think that Congress could not have contemplated that a minority union, even in the absence of majority representative that a minority union could ever, could ever exercise plenary authority to represent both -- all of the employees in a unit both a consenting minority as well as the non-consenting majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.018" offset="14971486">Indeed, when the majority rule principle was adopted by Congress, there was some concern expressed over the notion of putting even the man consented, minority under their control of the majority, but Congress concluded that the majority rule principle gave assurance of both stability and workability and it adopted this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.045" offset="15051525">Now, it seems to us, it seems to us that to say that a minority union representing only minority employees may represent both the majority as well -- do not consenting majority as well as the consenting minority, it is simply to stand the majority rule principle on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.376" offset="15116831">Now, additional evidence of the congressional understanding that the statute does not permit, that the statute does not permit a minority union to serve as the exclusive representative of employees in a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.992" offset="15163329">It is furnished by the 1959 Amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.852" offset="15178794">For some years prior to 1959, proposals have been made in the Senate and Congress to exempt certain industries, among them the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.534" offset="15221530">To -- to exempt certain industries from the majority rule principle because the majority rule principle had been found to be unworkable in those industries because of the casual intermittent employment that obtains in that industry as well as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.505" offset="15281403">These efforts fail because Congress was unwilling to sacrifice the majority rule principle even under the light of those considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.994" offset="15315362">But in 1959, in 1959, Congress passed Section 8 after the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.836" offset="15342738">And Section 8 after the statute permits an employer who is engaged primarily in the construction industry to enter into what is called, into what is called pre-hire agreements with the union which either represents none of his employees or a minority of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.511" offset="15409403">Now, the special dispensation which has been thus accorded to the construction industry and the legislative history behind it which we have set forth in our brief, I think evidence, as the congressional understanding, that recognition, exclusive recognition through a minority union is incompatible with the majority rule principle of the statute, and that in order to permit it, in order to permit it a special statutory provision was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.937" offset="15519117">Now, again, again, further evidence of the congressional understanding of what the majority rule principle in the statute means is to be found in the appropriations to the Board's, to the Board -- to the writers, to the -- they found in the writers to the Board's appropriations from the years 1944 to 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.540" offset="15597484">And these appropriations, these writers, the Court will recall, were considered by this Court last term in the Bryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.852" offset="15630817">Under those writers, the Board was precluded, was precluded from challenging an agreement between an employer and the union, if that agreement had been in effect, had been in effect for a period of three months or more without a charge having been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.112" offset="15699780">Now, in that -- those writers, those writers, as this Court noted, as this Court noted in the Bryan case and the opinion my Mr. Justice Harlan that, I'm reading from the opinion, "That that legislation, these writers were enacted with the specific reference to agreement with minority unions."</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.177" offset="15792044">And again dropping to the footnote on that page, the Court again noted the debates, the debates concerning the writes, showed that the issue of representation by minority unions was in the forefront, in the forefront of legislative concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.307" offset="15848573">Now as I say Congress by this -- these writers concluded the Board from upsetting a contract even with the minority union which had been in effect for three months without a charge having been far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.811" offset="15890578">Now, if -- if, as the other side argues, the statute would -- permits, permits an employer to the Court exclusive recognition to minority union, then these writers would have been unnecessary, it seems to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.697" offset="15942196">Now, here, here, the employer has done quite the reverse of what we think the statute commands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.312" offset="15968632">It has accorded exclusive recognition to a union which has not been designated by a majority union and instead of the non-consenting minority being placed under the consenting majority, the reverse has taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.208" offset="16020250">The non-consenting majority has been put under the control of the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.657" offset="16041984">Now, we think, we think that such recognition, in the first place, offends the legislative -- the statutory prohibition against employer's support of a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.892" offset="16094960">Long ago, as it has already been indicated, long ago this Court said that where the employer accords exclusive recognition to a union that recognition gives it a marked advantage, a marked advantage in competing for the support of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.347" offset="16164760">That kind of recognition obviously enhances the prestige of the union, the eyes of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.624" offset="16185866">And we think that in every meaningful sense, in every meaningful sense, it is a kind of support which the statute forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.723" offset="16214288">Now, of course, it's true, it's true that where you have a majority union, which is recognized that it too derives some kind of support from -- from the recognition but the difference between that case and this one here is that in the one case, the majority union, the statute requires the employer to recognize that union but here, here, there is no statutory sanction for the support which a minority union derives from having obtained exclusive recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.381" offset="16328913">Now, we also think, we also think that the Board found in this case that an employers recognition of a minority union as an exclusive bargaining representative of all the employees also constitutes an impermissible form of interference with the employees' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.750" offset="16406340">Section 7 of the right guarantees to the employees, among other things, the right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing or to have none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.402" offset="16445001">Whether an employer voice upon him a non-consenting majority, a union which they have neither -- may have neither wanted nor designated, nor names him, the exclusive recognition negates and abridges that right to be free, to be free of an unwanted union, to select their own bargaining representative or to have none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.892" offset="16538937">Now, it is argued, it is argued that the employer and the union in this case acted in a good faith believe that the union represented a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.933" offset="16595153">Now, as a matter of fact, the record shows, the record shows that the employer accorded recognition to this union as exclusive bargaining representative without proof either being demanded or adduced that the union represented a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.602" offset="16657742">And in fact, the fact is, the fact is that the employer accorded this union exclusive recognition upon the unions on verified claim and as it turned out to be erroneous claim that it represented the majority of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.158" offset="16711973">But in any event, in any event, it is our position that the good faith of the party is the good faith believed that this union represented a majority is an irrelevant consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.120" offset="16763904">In the first place, the statute does not say that a union which is deemed in good faith to represent a majority of the employees shall be the exclusive bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.799" offset="16798595">The statute says that only a union which has the majority -- which has been designated by a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.350" offset="16820746">Secondly, secondly, the statute does not excuse interference or support because of the good faith of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.964" offset="16855228">What is unlawful, under the statute, is the active support of the active interference and properly so because whatever the impart is good faith may be whether or not he is acting in good faith, in either case, in either case, the right of the employers to be free of an unwanted union, to be free to bargain collectively to a representative of their own choosing, in either case, whatever the employers thinking may be, that right is impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.276" offset="16972466">Now, it's argued that in this case, there was no rival union, there was no union security, there was no union security provision which was incorporated in this contract, and finally that the employer, that the employer did not recognize this union because he favored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.521" offset="17077478">There are -- it is true, it is true that the Board has had a number of cases dealing with -- with recognition of minority unions and that the Board in those cases, beginning as early as Volume 4 -- Volume 5 rather, back in 1938, of its reports, that the Board has said wherever the issue is directly arisen, that the Board has said that exclusive recognition of a minority union is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.067" offset="17171623">It is true that in those cases, we've had certain factors like rival unions, we've had also the factor that there was -- that the contract gave the union some kind of union security provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.033" offset="17223555">But, Your Honor, the Board has never qualified in any of these cases which is cited in our brief and in any of these cases, the Board has never said, has never qualified the statement that recognition of a minority union, when it does not represent a majority, is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.475" offset="17281233">These other factors, the fact that there was a rival union in the picture, the fact that the employer may have given the union a union security provision, these were merely factors which underscored, which underscored the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.631" offset="17337866">They were not necessary to the violation in the Board's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.896" offset="17350928">They were not controlling or decisive, but they did underscore, they did underscore the fact that the employer, in those cases here, had invaded the employees' rights to be free of an unwanted union.</text>

            <text syncTime="4552.141" offset="18311920">Now, this brings me to the -- to the Court in Curtis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.800" offset="18326549">We don't read that case to be dispositive of the issue of this leg and this aspect of a case dealing with the union's violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.333" offset="18368658">In the Curtis case, we were concerned, we were concerned with the legality of the means used by the union to obtain its objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.441" offset="18409096">The legality of picketing used by a minority union to obtain exclusive recognition, here, we are concerned with the legality of the object.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.952" offset="18443160">Now, the legality of the means and the thrust of the Curtis decision was, that in view of the legislative history of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) and in view of other provisions of the statute that when it -- that insofar -- that with respect to organizational activity or picketing that Congress did not intend to enlarge the scope of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) to reach this kind of activity except where it was -- there was violence for the Court's language where it was -- where the action was tinged with violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.090" offset="18579728">And the reasons which led Congress to give that narrow -- that narrow interpretation of Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was that in the sensitive area of picketing, in the sensitive area of picketing and organizational activity to have given a broader scope, to have given a broader scope to Section 8 (b) (1) (A) would have seriously impaired legitimate, would have seriously impaired peaceful picketing or organizational activity for legitimate objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.399" offset="18688920">Now, except for disqualification, the note was repeatedly sounded in Congress that Section 8 (b) (1) (A) was the counterpart of Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.501" offset="18725386">And if, as I have suggested, if we are correct in saying that -- that this recognition constitutes restraint or coercion upon the part of the employer, then there is no compelling reason why it is any -- why it should not also be held to be restraint or coercion upon the part of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.958" offset="18791215">And the considerations, the considerations which -- which warned counsel, I believe, Your -- Your Honors' word was, which counsel against an expansive reading of Section 8 (b) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.039" offset="18843564">In other -- in other words, the impingement upon peaceful activity, which might -- which might invade or destroy the right to engage in peaceful picketing for legitimate objectives, those considerations are not applicable here because here, there is no danger, no danger of cutting down upon legitimate -- upon peaceful activity for legitimate objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.610" offset="18945860">The invasion of the employees' rights here whether it's by the employer or by the union, it's both immediate and direct, and it's not one which is easily remediable by an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.240" offset="18988283">Because in any election, this union having already obtained exclusive recognition, enters the list with a marked advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.059" offset="19027571">Now, let me say finally a word about the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.004" offset="19047424">The Board's order requires the employer to cease and refrain from according inclusive recognition of this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.364" offset="19088802">It also requires the union to refrain from acting as exclusive bargaining representative until or unless the union has been designated in a Board election by a majority of the employees as their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.712" offset="19146271">The Board's order also requires the company to cease giving effect to the October 10th agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.026" offset="19175528">Now, there are two attacks made upon this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.247" offset="19188381">The first is that the Board's order, insofar as it directs the parties to cease giving effect to the October 10th contract, is unwarranted, because it is asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.693" offset="19234147">By that time, the union had obtained a majority, had obtained a majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.289" offset="19256508">Now, whether or not the union did in fact obtained majority status by that day, we neither challenge it nor admit it, but whether or not they did, whether or not they did, it must be borne in mind that that majority status was achieved after the union had derived illegal support from the exclusive recognition which a company had accord us to at a time when that union was not entitled to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.190" offset="19360162">Now, we don't' believe that any -- we -- it's our view that any majority which the union may have had upon that date cannot be disentangled, cannot be disentangled from that illegal support and that the Board is entitled to say it's a tainted majority and that until the union has demonstrated in a free, fair and secret election has demonstrated its majority represent -- its majority status, it is not entitled to enjoy that contract because to do otherwise, to permit, to permit the union to enjoy this contract would be a tantamount to permitting this union to a wrongdoing, to enjoy the fruits of its own wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.118" offset="19507806">Now, the second -- the second attack it has made upon the Board's order is -- goes something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.006" offset="19531421">That the Board's order here is too broad insofar as it requires the company to do anything more than to withdraw exclusive recognition from this union, that in all other respects, that contract should be permitted to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.443" offset="19601115">I don't think this is the place to stop to -- to determine on whether the majority rule principle can be so easily avoided by simply having a contract that covers the conditions of employment of all the employees, the union as a minority union but by simply omitting the exclusive recognition that this is alright because here, in any event, the contract and the exclusive recognition which this union obtained were inseparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.932" offset="19723055">They were in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.278" offset="19728488">The union got this contract because it was purporting to act, because the employer recognized it as the majority -- as the exclusive -- as inclusive representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.708" offset="19770180">And in fact, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.413" offset="19777076">And we think that in this situation, in these circumstances, the Board is entitled to wipe the slate clean, to wipe the slate clean of all legally binding contractual commitments.</text>
