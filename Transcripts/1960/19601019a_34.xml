            <text syncTime="17.738" offset="174373">This case which is here on certiorari presents a state court an important question, whether or not a municipality may exclude all motion pictures for public view, unless and until they have been first submitted to a censor for the examination and censorship of their contents.</text>

            <text syncTime="51.534" offset="309478">It has the exclusive right to license in the City of Chicago a motion picture entitled “Don Juan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="60.629" offset="345840">We applied to the commissioner of police who pursuant to the ordinance is to censor for a permit pursuant to the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.226" offset="380322">We completed the application and the application was then tendered to the police commissioner with the licensing fee and the police commissioner refused the application on the sole ground that the motion picture itself had not been submitted for censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.880" offset="454928">We then repeated the application to the mayor because the ordinance provides that in case of a denial of a permit, the application may again be made to the mayor and we again make -- made the application for this motion picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.868" offset="514800">We've tendered the licensing fee and we again refused to submit the motion picture, and the license was denied exclusively on that particular ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.324" offset="564642">We then filed a complaint in the Federal District Court and we alleged diversity of citizenship because the petitioners in New York concerned and we also alleged that the action arises pursuant to the First and Fourteenth Amendments and we also allege that the damages exceed the amount of $10,000.</text>
