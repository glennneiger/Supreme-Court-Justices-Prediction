            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 72, Paul John Carbo, Petitioner versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.202" offset="140204">Mr. Wirin.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="10.049" stopTime="212.113">
            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="10.049" offset="143548">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.175" offset="160057">The issue in this case as the petitioner conceives it is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.602" offset="185762">It is whether or not a United States District Court may issue a writ directing the production before it of a defendant who have been charged with crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.797" offset="246575">Where the defendant at the time of the direction of the writ, the issuance of the writ, was outside of the territorial jurisdiction of the district, and where the respondent named in the writ also was outside the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.952" offset="335182">To put it a little bit more specifically in this case, the District Court issued a writ, it was denominated the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.156" offset="392025">It was directed to the -- to a jailer in the State of New York, directing that jailer to bring to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.712" offset="434239">And within the confines of the territory of the -- of the territorial area of the District Court in California, the petitioner who was then in custody in New York serving a sentence imposed upon him by the -- by state authorities for a violation of New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.855" offset="518771">Now, I think it maybe helpful, at least I hope it will be, if initially and preliminarily, we put aside issues of policy because we consider them issues of legislative policy in contrary distinction to judicial policy that are raised by the Government and hence our -- in -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.952" offset="623156">For instance, it is urged by the Government, urged very strongly and very persuasively that it is desirable that a District Court in the administration of the criminal laws, have extraterritorial jurisdiction and have jurisdiction to either produce before it a defendant who happens to be in custody in some other district no matter how far we move from the district where he is indicted because not to bring him for a trial is to give him sort of a -- an immunity at least while he is in custody from -- from prosecution and therefore, defeats the -- the administration of the criminal law and the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.910" offset="818970">Now, with -- with that argument, we might be disposed to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.639" offset="845928">But we suggest to that -- that argument belongs in the legislative halls rather than before this Court have a judicial tribunal or it maybe appropriate to make that argument to this Court in its capacity and its authority to make rules of federal criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.223" offset="920221">Let me just discuss this one bit further and then I'll move on to what we deemed to be the thrust of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.053" offset="979571">I think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.095" offset="983751">Let me just give Your Honor -- quickly then, the example which I was just going to give to Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.779" offset="1002454">For instance, we conceive that the United State District Court today has jurisdiction to issue process providing for taking into custody of a defendant anywhere in the union, this maybe done because of the present provision in the federal rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.850" offset="1102764">Rule 4 (c) (2) to be particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.130" offset="1115930">That rule expressly provides that this maybe done.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.534" offset="1133484">The rule indicates that the Revisers Committee recommended the adoption of this rule, adopted 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.107" offset="1163786">Because as the Revisers Committee pointed in -- as it appears in the annotation, the rule was adopted or was to be proposed, to modify the existing tactics which had obtained up to that time that process for arrest run only within the territorial jurisdiction of a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.247" offset="1248319">And so, here is an example where through the rule-making power which is legislative or quasi legislative, a practice narrowly limited territorially impaired to was extended beyond the territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.594" offset="1509752">Now, let me give you another -- another example to answer Your Honor's question with respect to subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.414" offset="1537024">We concede that the authority of a United State District Court to issue subpoenas in the criminal cases has obtained at the present time and has obtained since 1793 because in 1793, in the very second Congress, Congress specially provided that subpoenas of a court may be served in a district other than where -- where it is originally issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.596" offset="1681742">So that we say that initially these things, the problem is essentially and we think exclusively a legislative one that when Congress wanted to confer extra territorial authority upon a District Court, it knew how to do it and it did it, certainly it did it in language precise and clear and definitive in 1793 when it expressly conferred such extraterritorial jurisdiction in connection with the subpoena.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.119" offset="2155813">But in any event, we say that Congress explicitly narrow the authority of the District Courts in the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus so that the authority of the District Courts was limited territorially, and hence, until there is action by Congress or until there is action by this Court in his rule-making authority, the old law is -- stands and I was going to say it -- it is good enough for us in any event it stands for this case.</text>
