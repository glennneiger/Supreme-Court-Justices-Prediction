            <label>Mr. C. W. Wellen</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">It is the contention of the Government that Rule 34 obviously applies here to prevent the timeliness of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.128" offset="147832">However, this is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.821" offset="162670">It was not obviously applicable to us and apparently, in the Sullivan case, Rule 34 was not obviously applicable to this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.306" offset="204570">If the Government's contention is adopted, it would create a track for those who follow us to fall into.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.073" offset="235708">Their construction of these rules is a strained and torturous construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.844" offset="258800">It is contrary to the plain mandate of Rule 2 that the rules be construed in a simple and logical manner to promote justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.532" offset="309478">Further, if the appeal in this case is not timely under Rule 34 and Rule 37, then we submit that it was timely under Rule 12 (b), which permits a court to notice the invalidity of an indictment at any stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.985" offset="391293">And also, timely, under Section 2255 of the judicial code which permits a court to vacate any judgment where the indictment is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.301" offset="448554">I turn now to the sufficiency of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.314" offset="464645">This is an extremely important problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.475" offset="481259">It is grey -- a grave problem not only for these petitioners but for the country as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.222" offset="508217">Last year alone, 15,000 tax evasion cases either actual or threatened were handled by the Treasury Department and there is reason to believe that this number will increase as time goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.532" offset="573524">All it takes to make a tax evasion or a fraud cage is a determination by the revenue service that a tax deficiency exists and that such deficiency was due to willfulness.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.049" offset="751574">It is a deterrent effect but there are many millions more taxpayers to be considered and thousands more of revenue agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.919" offset="783026">I think that alone will cause the increase.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. W. Wellen</label>
            <text syncTime="182.200" offset="832136">Well that -- that's the problem (Voice Overlap).</text>
            <text syncTime="183.322" offset="836629">An agent determines the deficiency, says, it's due to willfulness and then we have a tax evasion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.082" offset="859721">At that point, records and information are withheld from the taxpayers as was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.090" offset="887724">When it was determined that this was a potential tax evasion case, the corporate records were seized, virtually, all the corporate records were taken to the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.112" offset="927848">And when we sought a bill of particulars, the assistant US attorney in charge of this proceeding referring to the literally thousands of papers in this room, said, “Here's your bill of particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.611" offset="977795">Our case will be made from these documents.”</text>
            <text syncTime="222.569" offset="993677">For this reason, it is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.688" offset="1006111">Your Honors, it is essential that this Court lay down reasonable rules for the conduct of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.336" offset="1036727">Since there will be so many indictments, the rules must be made clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.343" offset="1056789">Coming to the heart of the Government's argument on the indictment, the Government contends that an indictment in the mere wording of the statute is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.841" offset="1094719">However, this statute merely provides that any person who knowingly attempts to evade or decrees any tax is guilty of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.857" offset="1138813">That's all the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.969" offset="1147277">It's about as vague as a statute can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.177" offset="1164100">However, a number of lower courts have upheld indictments in the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.821" offset="1190640">This is on the theory that when an individual is indicted for evading his own tax, that individual is presumed to have a greater knowledge of his affairs than anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.522" offset="1237452">He has presumed or known what he did wrong and can conduct his defense accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.110" offset="1259813">That observation could not be applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.301" offset="1272560">Here, we have a huge corporation and we have employees of that huge corporation accused of aiding the corporation to evade its tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.306" offset="1320626">Two of these petitioners were job superintendents, they were outside men.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.078" offset="1339643">I doubt if they ever saw the books and records or the tax returns of this company and if they had seen them, they wouldn't understand what they meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.303" offset="1368586">It would be a mystery to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.838" offset="1378722">Therefore, when an indictment in the mere language of the statute is returned against these men, it is meaningless to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.310" offset="1416652">The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution provides that an accused shall be informed of the cause and nature of the charge against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.483" offset="1461269">This was not done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.386" offset="1468897">When measured by the Sixth Amendment, this indictment was absolutely insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.422" offset="1489063">These men do not know with what they were charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.824" offset="1498676">They didn't know then and they still don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.152" offset="1516022">In addition to the vagueness and insufficiency of this indictment, two essentials elements of the purported crime were missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.706" offset="1554160">The indictment did not allege that there was a tax deficiency in the income taxes of the Farnsworth &amp; Chambers Company for the years in question, nor did the indictment allege that the individuals had knowledge of any such tax deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.182" offset="1620093">The indictment did not say that all of the taxes, owed by this corporation were not paid when such taxes were due.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.395" offset="1652903">Indeed, the indictment did not even say that there was an underpayment of taxes during the years in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2312.007" offset="9351398">But -- see, their -- their argument is it isn't part of the main case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.026" offset="9367489">That the District Court and this Court should consider it as if it were -- if its out of time, then it has nothing to do with the -- at least their Section 2255 argument that its just like another motion to vacate and their Rule 12 (b) claim I take it is that you can make it anytime during the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.809" offset="9446588">Now, the short answer to their Section 2255 argument is that there weren't in custody, either -- either then when they made their motions or are their in custody today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.771" offset="9486503">Now they argue that some sort of constructive custodies involved since that their direct appeals were untimely, then they should've been -- been bail was improper and therefore, they should've been in jail but it seems clear that the Heflin case holds that 2255 is available only when a person is in custody and is entitled to be released from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.453" offset="9577200">And as to Rule 12 (b), we think that the history of that rule shows that the phrase “at anytime during dependency of the proceeding” does not include the period after determination of guilt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.844" offset="9626728">For that rule was promulgated under the Act of June 29th, 1940 which provides only for the promulgation of rules with respect to proceedings before verdict, plea of guilty or finding of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.182" offset="9680123">And Rule 34 on the other hand was promulgated under the earlier Criminal Appeals Rules Act of 1933 which provides for rules after verdict, plea of guilty or finding of guilty.</text>
