            <text syncTime="624.066" offset="2599685">One, relates, body and missing bride on earth may have been buried alive, man confesses, points to grave, contains a story of the confession of finding of the body, a picture of the victim as well as one of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.387" offset="2668962">Also, in the same issue of the Los Angeles Times, is a little chronology which is captioned police reconstruct kidnap murder events.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.741" offset="2710340">Now, this is police reconstruct the kidnap murder event.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.524" offset="2725491">So far, there's certainly been no conduct of the District Attorney to which we have reference to and to which this Court limited the granting of certiorari on the question of publicity and the question whether the defendants could obtain a fair and impartial jury for their trials in February and April of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.679" offset="2810128">On December 22nd, Monday, which is Exhibit 3, which has been referred to by counsel for petitioners and has been incorporated in one of their briefs is the issue of Ventura County Star Free Press of Monday, December 22nd, in which it is related that Olga's body found in County, nurse was beaten, strangled.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.509" offset="2905422">And a news report relating that suspect admits murder for hire in Casitas' place.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.817" offset="2934680">Now, in the separate article on the same page, on the same date, is a headline which reads, "DA urges death term in killings."</text>
            <text syncTime="717.125" offset="2971878">(Inaudible) plurally writer of the caption and I believe counsel for these petitioners have said that they do not attribute to the District Attorney the headline or the caption on any article.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.485" offset="3017331">But the caption was written by one who understood this as a statement of the District Attorney about his position on capital punishment, nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.356" offset="3060799">And he, at this time, it says, "The District Attorney, Roy Gustafson, today saw the Duncan murder as a reason for continuation of California's death penalty."</text>
            <text syncTime="748.191" offset="3096116">He issued the following statement, and then it relates what is set forth in this addition to which reference has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.468" offset="3129240">Now, we submit that this is a statement of the District Attorney in relation to his position on capital punishment, and as we point in one of the later exhibits, he had a purpose in doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.645" offset="3173961">Petitioners would say, it was a sinister purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.632" offset="3189948">It was not, it was because he is one of the outspoken advocates of retention of capital punishment in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.558" offset="3213563">The legislature within a short week and a half we're going to meet and as we'll see in one of the exhibits, the -- there were to be two measures which were going to be quite important measures before that legislative session in regard to abolition of capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.915" offset="3275003">And so the District Attorney was making his statement in regard to proposed to a pending legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.209" offset="3300185">And there's nowhere in here any relation to his asking that the citizens of Ventura County arise against these particular defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.334" offset="3332681">He is merely making his statement urging that the people retain as one of two alternative punishments in California for murders, the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.242" offset="3372387">And that's what it is, pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.558" offset="3385553">That's what the District Attorney said it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.434" offset="3393076">That was accepted by the trial judge in his ruling thereon was accepted by the States upon report.</text>
