            <text syncTime="10.427" offset="145115">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.392" offset="168939">The case is so important, as it seems to me, from a consideration of the Commerce Clause and my time is so short in any event, plus the fact that I am sharing it with the Assistant Attorney General of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.542" offset="221497">And I shall try to go directly to the point instead of reviewing what I think is the trend of the Court or let's say the difference in approach to such prominence as is today, compared with 1887, when you had Robbins against Shelby County and cases of that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.353" offset="304776">I may say, however, parenthetically in the beginning, that I think that those old cases like Robbins against Shelby County and Crutcher against Kentucky and not so old, but respectively old case, International Textbook against Pigg, all were cases in which the State was attempting to set up a barrier, was attempting to discriminate against out-of-state commerce and industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.235" offset="436328">And I will suggest to you and I think Mr. Satz will make more plain view that that is not at all the object of the registration statute that we're concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.654" offset="490036">Now, I would like to divide my argument into two general subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.865" offset="510830">The first has to do with the applicability of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.262" offset="532459">If you'll look at Lilly's business in New Jersey, as local commerce separate from interstate commerce and having covered that, then I would like to go to consider the applicability of the statute to Lilly's activities in the State, if you consider that those activities are wholly in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.310" offset="628590">Well, can't you save time by -- by submitting to the fact that this Court has to accept the fact that your court has applied this statute to Lilly.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.754" offset="678431">Yes, the -- the Court has, but I would suggest that there are two reasons why it could and I think yesterday's discussion brought out that the lower court didn't make a claim why it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.603" offset="729736">I would like to show two reasons, two general reasons why I think it could.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.064" offset="771636">Now, it seems to me, that for both branches of this discussion, you have to know what, in fact, Lilly does.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.520" offset="797445">Well, this is what it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.645" offset="809984">It's engaged in the manufacturing sale of pharmaceuticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.134" offset="827956">It sells its pharmaceuticals in interstate commerce from Indianapolis, its headquarters to local wholesalers in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.220" offset="876231">In the State of New Jersey, the Company maintains a head office in New -- New Jersey, where it has a sales manager and a secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.707" offset="926177">The company pays these people salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.214" offset="936208">It pays all of the expenses of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.413" offset="949060">And working under this sales manager are 18 detailmen, who travel about the State with samples and literature and whatnot and they brief the druggists, the hospitals, the doctors on the virtues of Lilly products.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.824" offset="1018650">They do more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.551" offset="1025546">They check stock in the drugstores to see that there is an adequate supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.676" offset="1054072">They police fair trade observance in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.749" offset="1074343">And in addition, still and I think, quite significantly on this case, they pick up orders from the local druggists and transmit those orders to the local wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.507" offset="1133380">And I think also, significantly, they do not, in any case, pick up orders from anybody for transmission to the home office in Indianapolis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.010" offset="5367411">And I believe the New Jersey courts do not, in any way, wish to control a foreign corporation by requiring it to register in New Jersey if that company that has not registered is merely suing on a transaction that arises out of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.321" offset="5452675">And in that regard, I believe it's particularly important today, using the same historical principles from Gibbons v.
