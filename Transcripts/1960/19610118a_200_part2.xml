            <label>Mr. Gordon Sinykin</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.782" offset="126516">The argument on behalf of the appellee will be divided between myself and the Attorney General of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.103" offset="167790">And I will try to deal with the questions of jurisdiction and First Amendment freedoms and my associate will discuss the proposition that integration of the Bar is a reasonable form and means of regulating the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.946" offset="251173">With respect to the jurisdictional question of whether an appeal lies in this case under subsection 2 of Section 1257, there is no doubt that the word statute of any state mean legislative action of some kind whether it is direct action by the legislature or -- or by delegated authority to a Commissioner of board or a municipality in the form of municipal ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.440" offset="405086">Likewise, there is no doubt that the integration orders here in question, orders promulgated by the Wisconsin Supreme Court constitute judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.893" offset="462973">The only question then, the only possible issue is whether such judicial action can be equated to legislative action under the word statute of any State as it appears in the appeal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.955" offset="527235">And we think clearly not because of the traditional distinction between legislative and judicial functions of the Government which would be obliterated if judicial action was said to be the same for the purposes of the appeal statute as legislative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.483" offset="613334">As far as appellant's argument is concerned that if the orders have the effect of law, that is true of all judicial acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.295" offset="656593">Orders and judgments of courts have the effect and force of law as in the case of enactments of a legislature that no one would contend that thereby, they are state statutes under subsection 2 of 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.102" offset="727751">If Congress had intended the words statute of any state to apply to judicial action, it certainly as Mr. -- as it has been said by Mr. Justice Brandeis in a dissenting opinion, it could've made its intent and meaning clearer in the wording of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="714.495" offset="2961324">It went on to point out the close relationship in the judicial process between the lawyer and the Courts, but the Courts depend upon the lawyers and their scholarship and their aid in assistance in the functioning of the judicial process in that, it is not undemocratic to require those who are privileged to practice law and are entrusted with the duty to secure or protect the property, rights, and liberties of others to become bound together in a united effort to increase their own capabilities to maintain the high-standards of the group and to increase the effectiveness of their service to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.002" offset="3159333">The integrated bar said it has been defined as a process by which every member of the Bar is given an opportunity to do his share in carrying out the public service of the Bar and oblige to bear his portion of the responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.778" offset="3222444">And it added, most objections have centered round the obligation to bear a portion of the responsibility, but in the nature of things, every privilege has a correlative obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.523" offset="3301439">Now, the counsel for the appellant here has stated that in the opinion of the court below that the Court justified or grounded the need for integration on the basis of the public be entitled to the views of the lawyers and legislative matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.955" offset="3443231">Now, I think that that gives undue emphasis to the State and the Court, but the Court merely said in that case was that appellant's argument as to unconstitutionality is grounded upon the proposition that the State Bar expresses opinions on legislative matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.946" offset="3535182">And then it went on to say that this was a -- this serve the public purpose, that this was in the public interest and that the public was entitled to know it how these experts what their opinions were on legislative matters within a narrow restricted field.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Sinykin</label>
            <text syncTime="893.795" offset="3678542">Sir, I think that this case presents with respect to the integrated bar really only the issue decided in Hanson with respect to labor organizations namely the question whether lawyers can be compelled to belong and pay dues to the State Bar in the exercise of the State's power to regulate the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.547" offset="3793586">Appellant has made it clear here and it certainly clear from his complaint and from the record that his objection as to the general proposition of having to belong to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.530" offset="3861504">His second objection is to the Bar rendering any legislative services, giving any legislative opinions regardless of whether he agrees or disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.056" offset="3911555">In fact, in his complaint, he doesn't allege any disagreement except in one instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.044" offset="3939558">He says that the State Bar opposed some legislation which he favored but he doesn't say what it is, but going through the few bills up to the time of the complaint, and going through the few bills in which the State Bar took the position in the period of a two and a half years of its existence there were about 13 or 14 bills on which the State Bar took a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.528" offset="4069439">The only bill which he had opposed that I can see during that time is the bill to repeal the Integrated Bar Act and the position that we took on that was merely to write a letter to the Assembly Judiciary Committee which I wrote merely stating that under the decisions of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the responsibility for continuing or discontinuing integration was with it as a matter of law and not with the legislature and that its repeal would be ineffective for the purpose of disintegrating the State Bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.256" offset="4500355">As to that, his objection is the same as in Hanson bear membership is a ground for his objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.783" offset="4554480">As he stated here, he admits the power of the State to require a license fee of lawyers for regulatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.095" offset="4599724">So, his objection is not to the annual dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.156" offset="4611950">His objection runs to being compelled to belong to an organization of lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.939" offset="4659179">But he was required to belong to the bar before integration when he of his own free will decided to become a lawyer and qualify himself to become a lawyer, he had to be admitted to the Bar, he had to become a member of that Bar and in order to practice law, he had to remain a member in good standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.990" offset="4751339">And as such a member, he accepted all the conditions and burdens and restraints which go at the pre -- prerogatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.416" offset="5285073">What integration did was simply to take this body of court officers, called the Bar, and give it a constitution in the form of rules and bylaws under which the profession could operate with the form of self-government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.131" offset="11735855">In the next few moments, I would like to address myself to the issue of the -- whether or not the regulations of the Court to the integrated bar and in the State of Wisconsin violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.725" offset="11794265">We believe that the regulation is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.611" offset="11809834">The points I would like to discuss at the authority of the Court and briefly, I don't know if we have that in throughout the history of the -- this integrated bar in Wisconsin and the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.825" offset="11862706">The integration of the State Bar of the State of Wisconsin we believe is a reasonable method of regulating the practice of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.379" offset="11912861">I think that it is quite clear from the pronouncements of this Court and on the history of jurisprudence that the Courts have an obligation to control the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.942" offset="11967091">In England, they did it through the courts, didn't do it but the ends of Court did it, and this Court in several cases has been pointed out such as in the Thread case by Justice Frankfurter, the Court's control over a lawyer's professional life derives from his relation to the responsibilities of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.679" offset="12050056">In our briefs, we have cited several other authorities for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.143" offset="12067924">This has been recognized in the State of Wisconsin in our four integration cases where the Supreme Court of our State has indicated that they have a -- they have a responsibility to the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.357" offset="12132812">The -- in addition to that, our state legislature passed the law Section 256.30 which stated as a misdemeanor can practice law without a license and furthermore that you could be held in contempt of Court can practice law without a license which infer -- which indicates the legislature recognized the inherent power of the Court to control the practice of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3040.930" offset="12267081">I think that of course it's not only based on historical precedent but it's based upon practical necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.894" offset="12290905">It starts out with the practice of law when you are admitted to the Bar, and you are given a monopoly over a certain field of activity and this monopoly, like all monopolies, I believe, have to regulated or at least to this public has to be protected from the abuse of the people who control the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.271" offset="12368436">The Court in Wisconsin felt that it was very important that the Bar association, or the lawyers of the State be conscious of their responsibility to the Court in the administration of justice and to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.894" offset="12442937">In other words, that we rise above mediocrity and the history of the integrated bar in Wisconsin I think indicates that this is a reasonable approach and it has not been something that's rash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.056" offset="12515558">Now I'd like to just quickly go through the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.107" offset="12527783">In 1935, the State Legislature of the State of Wisconsin passed a law authorizing the Court to establish the integrated bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.969" offset="12571251">This law was vetoed by the acting governor at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.702" offset="12590164">In 1943, the state legislature, that is the people of Wisconsin through their legislature, passed another law and directing the Court to integrate the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.499" offset="12637393">And to the end, and I quote from the statute “that such association shall promote the public interest by maintaining high standards of conduct in the legal profession and by aiding in the efficient administration of justice”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.944" offset="12691101">In other words, the people of the State of Wisconsin were literally crying out to their Court, "Why don't you supervise these lawyers?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.124" offset="12723911">And the leading members of the Bar also cried out to the Court for that and their cries fell fortunately on deaf ears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.188" offset="12756093">In 1946, the Court again refused to integrate the Bar and on the theory to quote them, that the price and I quote is the 46 decision, the phrase of integration that is supervision or policing by the Court by the activities of lawyers and it would be much greater than the Court or any lawyer ought to be willing to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.101" offset="12855777">That was the logic of the 46 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.834" offset="12866748">In my judgment, I think the Court misconceived its role because actually, the fact that you have a Laissez-Faire system doesn't mean that you necessarily have -- have freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.565" offset="12913664">I think the Court has an obligation and they seem to recognize that to prevent things from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.398" offset="12940936">In 1956, the Court ordered the integration of the Bar on the theory that they are -- that the lawyers are entitled to the supervision and control of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.340" offset="12988688">This Court here sitting here today admitted a group of lawyers to the Bar of the United States Supreme Court, you did this on the assumption that the States are assuming their responsibilities to supervise these lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.133" offset="13043858">They see to it the lawyers are following the -- the ethics of the profession by carrying out their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.139" offset="13075937">I think that the record in this case in the case that there have been no violations of any of the freedoms of the appellant is, and there has been no violation of his freedom of speech or his freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.971" offset="13135287">The appellant as my colleague, Mr. Sinykin pointed out the appellant when he became a lawyer, he joined the Bar of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.557" offset="13169560">And the integrated bar is merely a mechanism for the Court to supervise its own Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.373" offset="13196831">And it's up to the State to determine which method of supervision, granting they have the authority to supervise it and it's reasonable as to which method they -- they should use.</text>
