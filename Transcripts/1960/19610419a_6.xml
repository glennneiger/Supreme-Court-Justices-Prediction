            <text syncTime="14.569" offset="162649">This is an individual voting rights case brought by 11 qualified voters in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.441" offset="210192">In their complaint, they alleged in substance that by an affirmative purposeful and systematic plan embodied in a 1901 Act of the Legislature, their voting rights have been diluted and the base to the point of nullification.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.094" offset="292739">A United States -- the District Court, three-judge court, dismissed their complaint on the ground that it had no power to protect their voting rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.197" offset="345192">Our position is that that decision was error, that there exist no judicial, no man's land in connection with constitutional rights of individual on the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.755" offset="395452">Now, the facts alleged in the complaint were of course admitted by the motion to dismiss and they are in substance, this, Tennessee's Constitution which was adopted in 1870, provided that in 1871 and in each 10-year -- every 10 years thereafter, there should be an enumeration of qualified voters and then the House of Representatives and Senate should be reapportioned according to the number of qualified voters in each county or district.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.646" offset="578936">There are -- under the Constitution, 99 seats in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.265" offset="605477">And so -- and if you reapportion the House according to the number of enumerated qualified voters under the constitutional formula in Tennessee, you divide 99 into the number of qualified voters, which in 18 and -- or in 1900 was about 487,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.234" offset="709339">There are around two million today.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.582" offset="722714">The House has one peculiar provision that doesn't apply to the Senate and that is provided that in reapportioning the House, every county that has the required -- two-thirds of the required ratio is entitled to a Representative, they're 95 counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.873" offset="815919">And in reapportioning the Senate in a fraction of representation that is lost in the House, shall be made up as near as maybe practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.110" offset="864820">So it's quite obvious that this is a -- a mathematical formula designed to ensure majority control in -- in Tennessee and to -- right into the fundamental law, this requirement of equality of representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.707" offset="4635230">I have referred to the -- the State Legislature, we have set forth here in an exhibit on page 126 to 160, the record of every proposal for reapportionment in the Tennessee Legislature and that shows that over and over again, every bill for reapportionment since 1901 has voted down that in the Senate, no such bill has ever received more than 13 of the 33 votes and in the House, no bill has ever received more than 36 of the 99 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.537" offset="4770544">So I think that it's almost beyond question that the Legislature itself is not going to change this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.617" offset="4806907">Now, with respect to the Tennessee courts, the state courts, the Supreme Court has held that it will not grant any relief here because to do so according to their view, would destroy the Legislature and destroy the Government of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.710" offset="4867197">And without discussing the merits of that at this point, I say that -- that demonstrates that relief through the state courts is absolutely impossible in the State of Tennessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1201.499" offset="4910352">The Governor -- the Governors I should say, have repeatedly in their messages, the Legislature called attention to this shocking situation and asked the Legislature to reapportion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.063" offset="4956641">And as I pointed out just a moment ago, the most they have ever gotten were 13 votes in the Senate and 36 votes in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.500" offset="4990391">So -- and the Governor can do nothing about it, but call it to the attention of the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.873" offset="5007841">And they have -- have done that over and over again as this exhibit attached to the complaint shows without results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.647" offset="5035008">Now, as for the people themselves, there is no initiative and referendum in Tennessee and so the people can do nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.428" offset="5090074">It requires that a -- an amendment passed, the State Legislature wants and then be advertised six months before the next meeting of the Legislature, it passed the first time by majority vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.523" offset="5138453">But the second time, it must pass by two-thirds vote and of course these legislators obviously, are not going to vote any constitutional amendment that will take care of this situation because they control the Legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.798" offset="5919619">It's true that, in times, gone by and I refer to that in discussing Smiley versus Holm and some of the case in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.121" offset="5948876">They did require equality in congressional districts, but I have some trouble with the Fourteenth Amendment provision that you refer to because in the Fourteenth Amendment, it only provides that you can deny representation to any state, a certain amount that discriminates against anyone on account of a violation of equal protection or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.991" offset="6060366">So it's not clear that -- that the Congress itself, could adopt the law requiring State Legislatures to reapportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.170" offset="6089101">I -- I think that -- that there would be a -- a great deal of doubt as to whether that legislation that they referred to in Section 5, was intended to encompass this kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.868" offset="6135912">I think it was more having reference to the congressional rather than to the state malapportionment picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.321" offset="6169663">I think the -- it's -- it's a fair summary of the facts to -- to say as Mr. Chandler has said so many times that the real question here is whether or not, you're going to have two classes of citizenship in Tennessee, half slave and half free, or at least one-third free and two-thirds slave, because there is no way that you can get out of this illegal straightjacket without some federal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.377" offset="6293901">Now, our first point in support of our complaint is this, that these appellants have proper standing to maintain this suit for redress of their -- or deprivation of their -- their voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.031" offset="6368507">That a voting right is a civil right and under their Ku Klux Act of 1871, this is one of the civil rights that is referred to there, rights under the Fourteenth Amendment that a state may not deny under color of -- of state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.076" offset="6452726">We think that the right to a full vote rather than a fractional vote is recognized and guaranteed not only by the Constitution of the State of Tennessee, but by the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.748" offset="6507374">The -- the right to vote is certainly the most basic or one of the most basic rights that Americans posses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.343" offset="6537780">It's a very heart of our system and this Court has time and time again, upheld complaints by individual voters to either secure damages for deprivation of their voting rights and it has also ordered injunctions to issue, to protect voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.036" offset="6620536">Now, the violation of the Fourteenth Amendment here by giving these appellants only a fraction of a vote, is a personal private wrong to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.087" offset="6672781">This is not a public wrong or -- or a contention that you have bad government in Tennessee or that we have an own -- own interest of that kind, our complaint is based not on any abstract right, but on the right to equal representation, to an equal vote given to the State of Tennessee and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.590" offset="6766717">Now, in Smiley versus Holm, this Court allowed a citizen, elector and taxpayer to attack malapportionment of the congressional districting in -- in Minnesota.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.961" offset="6852190">They -- you reviewed such attacks on the merits and we feel that there can't be any real question about the standing of these individuals to come into a federal court, rely on the statute, 42 U.S.C. 1983, contend that they have been deprived of one of their civil rights and then rely for jurisdiction of the Court upon 20 or -- or 28 U.S.C. 1343 which gives the Federal District Courts original jurisdiction to redress deprivations of civil rights and then in 1957, the Congress made it quite clear by an amendment that they interpret civil right to include voting right all this Court had time and time again, prior to that also included voting rights as a -- one of the civil rights that the -- anyone was entitled to sue on for deprivation of, under the so-called Ku Klux Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.830" offset="7167749">So when the Congress in -- in 1957 and again in 1960 in the Civil Rights Act, it -- it defined both areas any action to make a vote effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.789" offset="7223547">This Congress, we feel has established a policy or tried to establish a policy of judicial action not in action in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.311" offset="7265656">And that the -- there can't be any question about the jurisdiction of federal courts under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.342" offset="7309751">Now, there has been no case that I can find by this Court that really flatly holds that federal courts have no jurisdiction to protect voting rights such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.642" offset="7367011">In Smiley versus Holm, Carroll versus Becker, I've just referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.781" offset="7383521">The Court did order this -- this protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.344" offset="7397731">Now, we recognize that in Colegrove versus Green, we have a major problem of -- of distinguishing what we considered to be a misunderstood decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.925" offset="7472128">There, as the Court will recall, there was a claim that Illinois, if had not reapportioned its congressional districts since I believe in 1901, at that time, this case is dated 1946, was required to -- to do so under the Fourteenth Amendment or because in -- you had some congressional districts where you had 900,000 people and others with only 100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.555" offset="7578603">And this Court voted one to one to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.825" offset="7599710">And the -- the real decision was that -- that no relief would -- would be granted, but on the jurisdictional point, Mr. Justice Rutledge joined with Mr. Justice Black, who had written the judgment for three who thought jurisdiction exist and held that the Court did have jurisdiction, but he thought it shouldn't be exercised because of the eminence of the election which was in contest there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.736" offset="7731367">And it's true that Mr. Justice Frankfurter in -- in his opinion after citing Wood versus Broom, which it held that there was no longer any requirement, any federal law requirement that these congressional districts be substantial equally that had been removed in 1929, although it existed in the 1911 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.552" offset="7826557">So that as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said there, “The legal merits of this controversy were -- were really settled in that case."</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.009" offset="7856441">That's Wood versus Broom which eliminated the requirement of the equality among congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.180" offset="7881101">Now, we have a different situation here because we have a constitutional provision in Tennessee that requires equality in this House of Representatives' counties and districts and in the senatorial districts in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.487" offset="7942332">So the fundamental law that applied -- the requirement that applied in the Colegrove case was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.051" offset="7980575">From here, there was no fundamental law requiring equality of congressional districts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.855" offset="8003772">The next point of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion was that Congress had exclusive power to order these congressional districts to be equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.992" offset="8052360">Now, we feel that no such exclusive power exists in the Congress with respect to reapportionment of state legislatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.256" offset="8089454">So our interpretation of Colegrove simply is that it is not a decision against this on jurisdiction, but it's for us on jurisdiction that the decision of this Court was not against jurisdiction, but for a jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.248" offset="8157372">And therefore, we distinguish it and we say that the lower court here and the other courts that have cited it as holding that no jurisdiction exists are in error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.037" offset="10440579">Another thing that -- that we mentioned in our brief that could be done is the Court could appoint a master to conduct an election under the constitutional formula, or order the state officials to come up with the plan which under the constitutional formula, which it could approve or disapprove.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.917" offset="10600030">This Court can take its own view of the remedy and it need not follow the view of the -- of Tennessee court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.203" offset="10629183">And we also have the fact that the Tennessee Constitution has almost identical provision with those relied upon by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in Smiley versus Holm, when he ordered this election at large out in -- in Minnesota.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2707.920" offset="10936069">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.619" offset="10950907">The United States appears in this case as amicus curiae partly because it involves the constitutional rights of the large number of citizens, both in Tennessee and elsewhere, but also because it raises issues that lie very close to the heart -- our system of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.606" offset="11030841">It involves not only the integrity of the electoral process, but also of course, a difficult and delicate question concerning the proper role of the judiciary in securing voters' fair representation in their State Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.286" offset="11101581">I shall devote my argument to three propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.837" offset="11119762">The first is that the complaint alleges a deprivation of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, the right to be free from arbitrary discrimination in the exercise of the franchise which is sufficiently personal to give the victims of the discrimination standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.469" offset="11190293">Under the general jurisdictional statutes of course, the federal courts do have a right to hear cases, to remedy alleged depravations of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.499" offset="11242433">Our second proposition is that a complaint alleging the deprivation of constitutional rights through malapportoinment presents a justiciable controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.314" offset="11285692">In the sense that the courts do have jurisdiction over the subject matter to hear the case, adjudicate its merits and grant equitable relief under appropriate circumstances also under other circumstances, they might in the exercise of the discretion of an equity court, dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no useful relief which the Court could administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.477" offset="11382345">Our third proposition is that at this stage of the case, there is at least enough likelihood that the court below sitting as court of equity, could find some administrable form of relief to make it improper, to dismiss the complaint at the very outset before the facts had been fully with the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.707" offset="11479207">It seems --</text>

            <text syncTime="3737.632" offset="15054952">And to begin by drawing the distinction to which I adverted in a discussion with the Chief Justice a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.139" offset="15084941">The distinction seems to me to be exemplified by the difference between the opinions of Justice Frankfurter and Justice Rutledge in the case of Colegrove and Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.999" offset="15132379">It's one thing I think, to hold that the courts have no jurisdiction over claims of malapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.651" offset="15159024">Meaning, that there is no power to deal with the subject matter, because it – because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.342" offset="15197790">And it's quite another to hold that there is jurisdiction of the subject matter that the Court has the right to adjudicate merits and then to go on and consider whether this case is one in which it can appropriately frame a relief, and then to decide as it goes through the case, at any appropriate state of whether equity should act or whether equity should decline the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.172" offset="15309072">Now, this is something quite familiar in private law and it was imported by Justice Rutledge's opinion following an earlier concurring opinion in Wood and Broom into the law -- into the law of this Court in dealing with this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.572" offset="15386708">There are, I think, two very important differences between the two approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.329" offset="15413666">A denial of jurisdiction over the subject matter would exclude all malapportionment cases from judicial consideration as category, without regard to the seriousness of the constitutional wrong, without regard to the ability of the Court to grant relief or indeed necessarily without regard to any other considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.390" offset="15501960">On the other hand, if the Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and they followed Justice Rutledge's analysis, then of course it may examine the merits as whether equity can usefully act and provide flexible treatment according to the necessities of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.786" offset="15579491">The other difference is one which was suggested by some of Justice Whittaker's remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.234" offset="15605300">If there is jurisdiction of the – if there is no jurisdiction of the subject matter, the complaint must be dismissed at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.214" offset="15633304">That's that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.993" offset="15640409">If there is power to deal with the question, but this is a matter of equitable discretion, then the Court may postpone examining the question of whether it could afford a proper remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.149" offset="15701013">It may proceed step by step judging according to the cases it develops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.667" offset="15727031">And in this kind of case, I suggest that in accordance with the response of the State Legislature or other state authorities, what action if any, should be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.186" offset="15773111">As I read this Court's opinions, the Court has never held that it lacks power to deal with controversies over apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.208" offset="15809264">It adjudicated such cases in Smiley and Holm, Carroll and Becker, Koenig and Flynn and then of course later in Wood and Broom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.310" offset="15845627">Of the concurring opinion in Wood and Broom is too short to be absolutely sure, but it seems to me to go on the ground that the Court should decline to exercise its equitable discretion rather than on the ground that it had no power to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.566" offset="15910619">In the later case of Colegrove and Green, as Mr. Rhyne pointed out, a majority of the judges who participated held that there was jurisdiction over the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.353" offset="15957849">And in -- there's nothing in the subsequent cases which is inconsistent with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.506" offset="15990450">It would seem to me that there are not only many distinctions between this case and Colegrove and Green, in terms of the propriety of exercising equitable jurisdiction, but that there are also two that go to the question whether there is jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.661" offset="16071011">Colegrove and Green dealt with the apportionment of congressional districts and the opinion relied very heavily upon the power of the House of Representative under Article 1, Section 5 to judge the qualifications of its members and on the power of Congress under Article 1, Section 4 to regulate the time, place and manner of holding elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.864" offset="16167873">And then the opinion says, the short of it is that the Constitution has conferred upon Congress exclusive authority to secure fair representation by the States in the popular House, unless to the House of Representatives determination whether the States have fulfilled their responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.848" offset="16251779">In the present case, we're dealing of course, with the right to effective representation in a State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.902" offset="16279991">The powers of Congress under Article 1 are manifestly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.000" offset="16300366">Furthermore, the relation of the Tennessee Legislature to the apportionment of the seats of all its members seems to me, to be quite different from the relation of the Congress to the apportionment of congressional districts in a single state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.179" offset="16373091">Because the way the State -- where the State Legislature is involved, a reapportionment would mean in fact, if my count is correct, that of the 50 members who control the lower house, at least 17 couldn't come back the next time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.743" offset="16439338">That sort of problem is not involved when you're looking at asking Congress to deal with the problem of apportionment in a single State Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.979" offset="16476327">Now, it's true as Justice Stewart pointed out that there remains the possible remedy of going to Congress and seeking to have it act under its power to enact legislation to carry up the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.661" offset="16531080">I think two things are pertinent to consider in that affection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.904" offset="16551978">One is of course that the Court in other cases under the Fourteenth Amendment has never allowed itself to be deterred from action by the fact that Congress might act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.272" offset="16597535">The second is that congressional action in this field it seems to me, could only result in putting the matter right back in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.868" offset="16639854">It's hardly practicable indeed, I'm not sure it would be constitutional power for Congress to hold a hearing on the apportionment in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.703" offset="16675171">So the most it could do would be to lay down a general rule and then to confirm the jurisdiction of the Court to hear such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.453" offset="16718221">If we are right, that jurisdiction already exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="4336.853" offset="17451844">The recent acts, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.429" offset="17458113">And that they are -- while they don't precisely deal with our problem, we can't assign jurisdiction under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.884" offset="17483922">I think they do show a congressional attitude toward this problem which the Court should take into account in dealing with this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.461" offset="17538257">I would like to turn now to the question whether the Court should exercise the equitable discretion which we submit exists or whether the case should be dismissed as happened in Colegrove and Green, for what of equitable jurisdiction, although the case was within the subject – within the power of the federal court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.071" offset="17664690">In our opinion, there are here, sufficiently compelling circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.049" offset="17688618">It would make it improper to dismiss the bill at this early stage of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.397" offset="17714009">I would like to take those compelling circumstances up one by one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.851" offset="17739818">First, I suggest, is that this is not a very troublesome case for adjudication on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.116" offset="17776912">As I suggested earlier, we do have in the Tennessee Constitution, the only ostensible basis for an apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.958" offset="17824246">And the existing apportionment clearly, egregiously departs from that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.072" offset="17856637">In the absence of any other standard, then it should not be hard to decide whether this is or is not arbitrary and capricious and of course, we suggest that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.891" offset="17907942">Second is the seriousness of the wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.336" offset="17929780">Here, the apportionment results in giving roughly a third of the people of Tennessee, the power in both Houses in the Legislature to control the other two-thirds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.388" offset="17985996">A vote in some counties and -- is worth 19 or 20 times a vote in other counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.378" offset="18021940">The serious consequences of this kind of maldistribution are discussed in our brief, also in the appellant's brief, but I don't intend to recount them all here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.289" offset="18069588">I would emphasize, however, that this kind of wrong is peculiarly one which calls for judicial intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.289" offset="18105532">We've often been reminded and quite right that the ultimate safeguard of constitutional rights is a vigilant electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.788" offset="18143566">But where the wrong goes to the existence or distribution of the franchise, then the electorate can do nothing to protect itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.897" offset="18196020">No matter how vigilant the majority of the people of Tennessee are, there is nothing that they can do under these circumstances to assert their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.703" offset="18243250">The only power to reapportion is in the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.406" offset="18257983">There is no provision for initiative or referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.898" offset="18275955">The only power that can call a constitutional convention is the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.701" offset="18299152">The Legislature of Tennessee has failed to act for 60 years and the Tennessee court has refused to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.055" offset="18336664">The short of this case is as Judge Miller pointed out in his opinion convening the three-judge court that either there is a remedy in the federal court or there is no remedy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.234" offset="18385356">So this is not a question where one can look to the working of the political process to solve the violation of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.712" offset="18435197">The third point which should be emphasized and I really just spoke to it a moment ago is that there is no other remedy that the plaintiffs have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.364" offset="18489846">I've outlined the lack of a remedy in Tennessee and discussed earlier, the lack of a remedy, a practical remedy in Congress and also the fact that the Court has never withheld its hand under the Fourteenth Amendment waiting for Congress to act and is therefore no need to re-elaborate those propositions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4668.437" offset="18778133">Well, I think – I think the two possible views and I would press both on the Court, the normal practice is, of course, to consider the question of remedies after you've dealt with the merits as Justice Whittaker suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.257" offset="18841454">And it would seem to me entirely proper for the Court to say there is jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.679" offset="18863083">We don't need to go beyond that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.348" offset="18873741">Now, in a number of cases, including Colegrove and Green and no doubt some of the per curiams, although I can only speculate about them, the Court has gone ahead and said, “Is there so little chance that an equity court could usefully contribute here, that the bill should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.895" offset="18971961">And I wouldn't object very much to anyone who's taking that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.249" offset="18989411">That is if there's clearly nothing the Court could usefully do, it might as well say so and be done with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.715" offset="19015220">But I think all we need to show at this stage is that one can't properly come to the conclusion that there's clearly nothing the Court can do at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.697" offset="19059210">That may turn out later and that brings me to the question, what can the Court do which should be weighed, I think, in with the need for action.</text>

            <text syncTime="5203.925" offset="20920069">And this Court -- what I was trying to suggest earlier was that this Court might want the benefit of a full exploration of the point by the three-judge court before it decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.274" offset="20961447">I would think this was a matter –- this Court should determine on the basis of how sure it feels or what doubts it has about whether the complaint does state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.969" offset="21008259">The point that I was seeking to make, Justice Whittaker, is that the problem of the remedy here differs very greatly from case-to-case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.959" offset="21076281">That there maybe cases dealing with apportionment where we could -- could see – let me say simply for the purposes of argument as you will, that it would be so far removed from a judicial function that the Court should not embark on the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.478" offset="21138348">We do not think that this is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.023" offset="21156530">The time is so short that I can't go into it, but there are four and I suggest a fifth factor in the present situation that sharply distinguishes Colegrove and Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.247" offset="21217343">In the first place, the Tennessee Constitution requires an apportionment in the relation to population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.153" offset="21261019">Second, it says that it must be by counties, where possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.514" offset="21286410">Third, no county may be divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.138" offset="21304905">Fourth, when counties are put together, they must be adjacent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.230" offset="21329356">And then I would add that if the Court were driven to the point where it must intervene, that I think we would all agree that there should be as little disturbance of the existing districts for the House and Senate as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.629" offset="21398946">Now, taking the map with respect to the Senate, one can remove the most glaring of the inequities, simply by merging five existing pairs of senatorial districts and allocating the Senators say, if -- if I may put it that way, to the Chattanooga area, the Knoxville area, the Nashville area and the Memphis area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.919" offset="21520050">This doesn't seem to me to involve any of the difficulties, at least in anything like the same degree that there were in Colegrove and Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.320" offset="21557666">One can accomplish much of the same thing by putting 11 pairs of adjacent counties together in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.672" offset="21599044">So that the range of discretion and the degree of interference which would be involved, if the Court were forced to go this far would be very small indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.425" offset="21654110">Now, I'd like to make one more point with respect to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.821" offset="21671664">It's quite clear of course, that what is most to be desired is that the Tennessee Legislature and the people of Tennessee will themselves correct this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.267" offset="21717431">And one of the advantages of a court of equity is that it can proceed slowly and a step at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.910" offset="21752017">Up to this point, the Tennessee authorities have simply taken the position as I understand it, well nobody touches.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.604" offset="21782841">If the federal court takes jurisdiction, that in itself will generate great forces for a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.993" offset="21820353">If the Court goes on to the merits and holds that there is an unconstitutional apportionment, I should be amazed if the Tennessee Legislature didn't act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.011" offset="21868419">After all, the force of the principle of legitimacy, the solemn adjudication that there is a constitutional obligation carries a great effect with most of the people in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.613" offset="21926828">So that at that stage, as happened in New Jersey, there's a very good chance that the legislature would act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.084" offset="21964758">Finally, there are these remedies and others are outlined in our brief, if the Court were driven to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5493.490" offset="22078339">This is an appeal from a three-judge District Court sitting in the Middle District of Tennessee, dismissing a complaint which was filed for the purpose of obtaining the reapportionment of general assembly districts within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.863" offset="22147824">There are certain observations in regard to the pleadings which I think are pertinent and should be discussed at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.211" offset="22185232">First of all, the 11 plaintiffs who bring this suit alleged that they do so, on behalf of all of the voters of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.327" offset="22229744">They also alleged that they bring it as a class action in the sense that they say that they have been discriminated against because their votes count less than those of their country cousins.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.433" offset="22290139">They alleged further that they're entitled to maintain this suit as a voting rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.411" offset="22346041">The defendants on the other hand are certain state administrative and judicial officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.255" offset="22389405">The truth of the situation is in regard to those defendants and I don't understand that there are any substantial allegations to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.432" offset="22438097">These defendants have very little to do with what the Legislature may ultimately do with regard to this issue of reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.740" offset="22491387">It is alleged in the complaint that they do have certain functions to perform in regard to this proposition of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.586" offset="22542691">But in either event, it seems to us that there is a lack of parties here to properly present this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.385" offset="22589921">We -– there's no county election commission that's brought before the Court in regard to holding elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.082" offset="22632761">The general assembly wasn't attempted and it's brought before the Court in regard to the reapportioning of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5641.716" offset="22671214">We think that in view of the situation in regard to these parties that the complaint is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.318" offset="22717712">Now, very rapidly, I want to summarize the allegations in regard to the -- what they predicate their claim upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.781" offset="22767553">First of all, they say that the 1901 Act apportioning the State of Tennessee is unconstitutional because it interferes with their voting rights under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5685.363" offset="22845816">They have heard that their voting rights have been debased.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.865" offset="22867864">They claim that as a result of the Tennessee apportionment formula in the Constitution that they are entitled to have the courts examine this question and find and declare that those provisions are mandatory and self-executions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.363" offset="22949888">Now, they make these general affirmance in regard to the provisions being mandatory and being self-executing and we suggest to the Court that those are nothing more than a – the conclusions of the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="5726.991" offset="23012373">They also assert that the 1901 apportionment statute became obsolete in 1911 and therefore it would become unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.442" offset="23062215">They set -- also assert that the failure to reapportion has been purposely and systematically handled by the Legislature in such a way as to be a denial of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.211" offset="23129192">They point to population growths and shifts and use the census figures in order to support their contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.924" offset="23168063">They charged that there's a discrimination in the allocation and distribution of state aid funds, particularly with reference to gasoline taxes and the general education appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.982" offset="23236295">They imply that there would be a different distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.629" offset="23258864">In the event, the Court grants them relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5794.046" offset="23280598">It held substantially three prayers in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.305" offset="23309646">The first one is that the apportionment statutes be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.890" offset="23335978">Then they say that these appellees should be enjoined from doing various the acts which they do in regard to elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.734" offset="23371295">And they should not do any of those things until the State is reapportioned in -- in accordance with the constitutional formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.039" offset="23412569">Then they finally assert that the appellees should be directed to hold a next election at large, for the members of the general assembly in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.663" offset="23483099">Now, in the District Court, the complaint was met with a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.202" offset="23521238">It was –- the motion to dismiss is on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.952" offset="23536180">First of all that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, secondly, the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted and third, that there was a failure to join indispensable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.331" offset="23597725">After the case was heard, a number of intervenors were permitted to come into the case including the Mayor of the City of Nashville and the Cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga.</text>
            <text syncTime="5886.843" offset="23651746">The three-judge court held that either on account of elect – of jurisdiction of the subject matter or the inappropriateness of the subject matter, it felt that it was bound by the prior decisions of this Court and relied upon Colegrove versus Green and the other cases which have been eluded to.</text>
