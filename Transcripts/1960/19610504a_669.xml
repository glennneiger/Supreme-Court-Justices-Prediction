            <text syncTime="31.374" offset="228916">Mr. Gressman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="32.910" offset="234977">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.339" offset="248769">This case comes here on a writ of certiorari directed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.244" offset="280325">And it raises an important and a somewhat baffling question of judicial administration, a criminal appellate justice particularly with reference to the right of indigent defendants to carry forward their appeals in forma pauperis in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.128" offset="359842">And in order to appreciate the problem as it has unfolded in this case, I think it well to describe very briefly the procedural course which this case has taken from the time of the trial up to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.034" offset="439463">Now, the petitioner, Benny Lurk was tried and convicted in the District Court for the District of Columbia for the crime of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.036" offset="483558">A felony is defined in the District of Columbia Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.359" offset="500799">During the trial, he was represented by a court-appointed attorney who, after the trial and after the sentence of judgment of conviction had been entered, withdrew from the case with the approval of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.662" offset="569971">The petitioner, thereupon, filed with the trial court an application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis from the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.556" offset="617618">The trial judge denied that application with the notation that the appeal was not taken in good faith and that it was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.625" offset="661922">Petitioner, thereafter, filed another application, this time in the Court of Appeals in which he requested leave to file an appeal in forma pauperis and made certain allegations of a very summering nature as to certain errors which allegedly had occurred during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.612" offset="773831">It was at that point that the Court of Appeals appointed me to represent this petitioner and directed me to file a memorandum in support of the petition which had been filed pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.352" offset="836733">My preliminary examination of the matter, of course, was limited by the fact that I had no knowledge whatever -- what had occurred at the trial and a trial transcript not being available.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.228" offset="896293">I was confined to determining as best I could from available persons, namely, the petitioner and his trial counsel what had happened at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.874" offset="950836">As a result of that examination, I was convinced that I could not conscientiously represent the petitioner and report back to the Court as to whether or not there was any basis for this appeal, as to whether or not there were any non-frivolous or reviewable issues which would entitle this petitioner to pursue his appeal in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.214" offset="1048221">Furthermore, I was not convinced that -- nor could I represent to the Court of Appeals that I was convinced that the trial had been completely free of all possible reversible or prejudicial errors in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.592" offset="1109765">Therefore, I made a motion on behalf of the petitioner to have the transcript of the trial produced at the expense of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.450" offset="1153128">And over the objection of the United States, that motion was granted and a transcript of the trial proceedings was furnished at the expense of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.688" offset="1198164">Thereupon, I was able to determine whether or not, in my mind, there was any basis for pursuing this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.765" offset="1246438">And in so attempting to present the position on behalf of the petitioner to the Court of Appeals, I felt it was obligatory on me to try to follow the standards of appeal in forma pauperis which had been set forth by this Court unanimously in Ellis against the United States in 356 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.149" offset="1339956">Now, very briefly that case held that the standard for determining whether to grant or deny a petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis depends upon the good faith of the petitioner and the --- under Section 1915 (a) of Title 28 U.S.C. and that that good faith is to be determined in -- by virtue of whether or not there is a non-frivolous issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.734" offset="1466284">And the Court was very decisive in spelling out the fact that if any non-frivolous issue is presented, the petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis must be granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.254" offset="1576417">It was the only copy produced and I do not have at present with me at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.332" offset="1600658">Mr. Davis tells me it was 75 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.086" offset="1611734">I don't think the trial lasted more than a couple of hours if that long.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.116" offset="1643813">Now, the Court in the Ellis case was also careful to point out that in determining what is non-frivolous, the Court of Appeals should not convert the standard of non-frivolousness into a requirement of any -- showing of any particular degree of merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.571" offset="1737644">So based upon those propositions, I attempted to present to the Court of Appeals two issues which I conceived to be non-frivolous in nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.518" offset="1837432">But that -- it hasn't -- I might point out that this Court has held in prior case that that type of certificate is subject to review and overruling an effect by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.527" offset="1881527">And the procedure has developed, and I assume generally although at least here in the District of Columbia that you can file a de novo application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals which in effect six-reversal of that district judge's certification.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="471.608" offset="1989778">That's right, Your Honor and that application before the Court of Appeals appears at page 8 of the record which is if you will see signed by the petitioner himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.788" offset="2062503">I assume that somebody helped him draw that up but, at least he did not have any counsel or record at the point of doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.226" offset="2100328">Now, the two non-frivolous issues I sought to raise involved, as I say, were two in nature.One of which, the first of which grew out of the -- of my examination of the trial transcript and it was the only way in which I could have discovered that such an issue possibly existed that warranted review.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.950" offset="2191130">That issue, of course, involved four or five references in the course of the trial to the fact that the complaining witness and Benny Lurk, at one time, served time together in the Occoquan Workhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.571" offset="2269706">And I submitted that in as much as the petitioner had never taken the stand, that this might well present a very serious question is to whether or not these references to the petitioner's prior criminal incarceration might not have unduly prejudice to jury and then it also involved, was the issue as to whether or not the trial judge in light of those various references had taken adequate precautions at the time the various references were made and in his final instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.019" offset="2431457">And in light of cases which I cited in a memorandum to the Court of Appeals, I felt that these were -- these were at least non-frivolous issues and that the issues were also present as to whether or not the failure of appointed counsel to take an exception to what the judge had done, was cons -- was allowed this issue to be perpetuated under the plain error rule so as to be reviewable by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.270" offset="2556426">All of those things I submitted were implicit in these facts growing out of the record and I felt presented a bona fide, a good faith a non-frivolous issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.089" offset="2619747">The other issue I raised, and this of course did not in anyway depend upon the availability of the trial transcript since it was obvious as of the record in the District Court was the growing out of the fact that the presiding judge at the trial, the judge who entered the judgement of conviction was Judge Joseph R. Jackson, a retired judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals who was assigned or designated to seat on the District Court for the year 1960 pursuant to the assignment statute 294 (d) of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.969" offset="2791215">Now, the -- those were the issues presented and I submit that they were non-frivolous within any meaning of the Ellis standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.859" offset="2850774">Now, comes the interesting part insofar as the development of this case in light of the Ellis standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.734" offset="2882330">The Government, of course, filed a two page opposition to this memorandum in which no mention whatsoever was made of the Ellis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.844" offset="2922768">No denial was made that either issue was frivolous in nature or the leave to appeal should be denied under Section 1915 because they did not meet the standards of that Section as interpreted in the Ellis case, instead, the United States argued in lawyer like terms and illegitimate legal argument that neither issue had any merit that I was wrong in both the first issue as to the prior criminal record references and that moreover, Judge Jackson did have the right to sit on this Court by assignments and that there was nothing to the constitutional issue as I had presented it.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.235" offset="3104266">But I emphasized the important point, and this I put forth in a reply memorandum that we are not under the Ellis case at this point in an in forma pauperis appeal dealing with the merits or the ultimate substance of either issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.361" offset="3176782">The only question opened at this juncture of an in forma pauperis appeal is whether or not there had been presented on behalf of the petitioner any non-frivolous issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.844" offset="6322761">Now, again, it is interesting to note that the opposition filed by the Solicitor General in this Court did not meet the issues as I would -- had presented them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.165" offset="6548041">"Therefore," said the Solicitor General, "this petition should be considered by this Court on the strength of the substantive issues presented" namely, the two issues involving the constitutionality of Judge Jackson's assignment and the other issue being the one of various references to the prior criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.469" offset="6633200">Now, I would say that on either theory, the one which I had adopted in analyzing the Court of Appeals' action were the one that the Government presented to this Court that there has been an egregious error committed by the Court of Appeals in denying this particular petition for leave to file.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.978" offset="7059310">And when we look at the concept of frivolousness and the -- the cross reference in the Ellis case to Rule 39 (a) of the federal rules of criminal procedure, I think we begin to see what is really meant by the term frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.193" offset="7120123">And the leading decision under Rule 39 (a) which involves of course prepaid appeals, the ordinary criminal appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.003" offset="7155336">This Court's decision in the United States against Johnson sets forth the fact that an appeal, a prepaid appeal may be dismissed under Rule 39 (a) if it presents a non-reviewable issue, an issue that is not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.883" offset="7222941">Now, I say that that is a substantial degree removed from any question of the ultimate merit of an issue that you can have a non-frivolous issue which turns out to be completely without merit upon a full examination of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.082" offset="8639718">Now, I might just add a comment or two about the Government's position in this point as revealed in its brief to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.783" offset="8686529">The Government as I read their brief would confine Section 1915 and the Ellis doctrine which we have been discussing to counsel's application for a transcript to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.607" offset="8737834">Now, this, I cannot understand neither the language of Section 1915 nor the Ellis case itself in its facts or in its decisions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.116" offset="8783809">It anyway supports a limitation of Section 1915 to counsel's application for the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.187" offset="8816097">In fact, I think that's an impossible burden or an impossible test to apply in situations such as in this case where I didn't know what the issues were that might arise out of the transcript and it was for that precise reason that I ask for the transcript and already determined if there were any non-frivolous issues, and how you could determine and apply a non-frivolous test to my application for the transcript is beyond it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.408" offset="8933021">I simply told the Court of Appeals that I don't know what these cases about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.227" offset="8948276">I can't adequately represent the petitioner without a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.419" offset="8965099">Now, Ellis doctrines and Section 1915 certainly do not apply to that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.258" offset="8992371">Now, on the other hand, once a transcript has been supplied as it was in this case, and briefs or memoranda are submitted by appointed counsel and by the Government, then the Solicitor General says, “Then you do no longer apply Ellis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.125" offset="9055901">You no longer Section 1915."</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.337" offset="9068753">Then it is entirely up to the Court to determine in its discretion whether or not they feel the issues presented and developed in the memoranda are sufficiently importance to warrant taking up any further amount of the Court's time in briefing -- reading briefs or in hearing oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.022" offset="9143463">Now, I submit that is a complete provision of Section 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.026" offset="9159450">It converts into what is in effect, a certiorari jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals and the -- by the cases that the Solicitor General brief cite in -- in this Court where this Court on petition for certiorari are on jurisdictional statements, take summary action of affirming or dismissing or denying the decision below has absolutely no relevance to the function of the Court of Appeals under Section 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.592" offset="9289749">It is not a certiorari jurisdiction for the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals is bound to imply entirely different standards under Section 1915 and this Court is called upon to exercise in determining whether or not to hear oral argument in the cases that come before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.797" offset="9366549">And the Congress has spoken very explicitly that at this juncture up to and through oral argument and that's what Section 1915 covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.719" offset="9414196">The petition for leave to appeal that you are not to cut off the petitioner from further proceeding on his appeal unless and until it has been determined that the issues he seeks to raise are frivolous in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.374" offset="9468844">If they are non-frivolous, then there is no discretion in the Court of Appeals to cut off further processing of that appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.517" offset="9513462">Now, I submit that limit breaking up the appellate process of this indigent appellants into these two categories that this Government suggests would result in -- on a gross discrimination against paupers who seek to appeal because the prepaid appellants who are subject only to the federal rules of criminal procedure in their appeal rights are not cut off from pursuing their appeal simply because the Court doesn't want to take time to listen to their briefs, read their briefs or listen to their oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.067" offset="9663613">There is as I say, not the -- the discretionary type of jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals that exist up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.355" offset="9700812">Now, I only wanted to briefly refer to the two issues that I raised below and to emphasize that whatever the standards may be, the standard of non-frivolousness even go beyond and if you will into standards of substantiality, I would submit that there can be no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.770" offset="9806451">But what the two issues which were sought to be raised on behalf of petitioner meet those standards and that they were of such substantial nature as to compel with the warrant, full review and determination on the merits by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.992" offset="9887326">Now, we've already discussed some length the -- the first issue raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.409" offset="9904985">I won't go into at any further except to say that -- that which the Government has not denied that precisely this same type of issue, these references to prior criminal record during the course of a trial was precisely the kind of issue which this Court in Farley against United States said was not frivolous in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.658" offset="10006026">So that I believe that that decision alone is proof of the non-frivolous nature under Section 1915 of this particular type of issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.315" offset="10056600">And I would submit that the arguments engaged in by the Government in their brief seeking to demonstrate its alleged frivolity only add to its non-frivolous nature because I have answers to each and every one of the contentions made by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.897" offset="10126921">I don't think that these issues are so clear cut, one way or the other at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.680" offset="10146043">I think they need and deserve fuller exploration in briefing an oral argument before the Court of Appeals on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.999" offset="10179375">Now, the other issue raised, of course, I believe not even the Government as at anytime asserted that it was frivolous in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.513" offset="10225455">It seems to me that a constitutional question which has never been resolved by this Court or by any other court, a constitutional question that had eventually resulted in the Government of the United States asking this Court to overrule one, if not more two or three decisions of this Court by its very statement is non-frivolous issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.186" offset="10348126">Now, I do not -- I would prefer to reserve until my rebuttal time fuller discussion of this issue except to point out several factors concerning this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.219" offset="10412283">I might say that it is an issue that was initially raised and inverted to in the Bakelite opinion in its references to the fact that there may be constitutional objections to the assignment of constitutional court judges to legislative courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.376" offset="10496920">It seems to me that by an even greater token, there may be constitutional objections to the assignment of legislative court judges to sit on constitutional courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.419" offset="10545089">But there was no attempt in Bakelite or in any other decision to meet or to resolve that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3723.737" offset="14998340">On the threshold question of the -- whether the Court of Appeals urged under 28 U.S.C. 1915 in denying petitioner further leave to appeal in forma pauperis, I would like if I may to set before the Court four factors which I think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.394" offset="15084962">I should use them in my argument but they are not arguments in themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.934" offset="15099068">The first factor is that this case and the problem of this case only rises where the District Court has denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.052" offset="15143581">That is it only arises where the District Court has denied to leave to proceed in forma pauperis where the District Court grants leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3785.851" offset="15246817">What -- what I mean to say is that you -- you start with the premise that the District Court has found that this -- that the appeal was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.167" offset="15276074">So it is not the same the situation as where -- it all -- it doesn't deal with all indigent appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.326" offset="15308675">They only deal with indigent appeals whether District Court has already made on a merit of termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.154" offset="15328005">The second factor that I'd like to present to the Court is, is that there is a special situation in the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.723" offset="15354232">They have general jurisdiction of local crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.482" offset="15365308">They have an enormous number of criminal cases as compared with other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.938" offset="15383176">They are larger circuit of membership but they have an enormous number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.307" offset="15400626">The figures that I have jived with those which Mr. Gressman gives to the Court, in the year 1960, the fiscal year 1960, the -- I'm told that the forma pauperis cases in the Court of Appeals that's excluding the ones where the District Court granted, just the ones applied to the Court of Appeals are 191.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.935" offset="15475127">Now, most of those were collateral attack, Section 2255 or habeas corpus but I think as Mr. Gressman has pointed out about 43 were on direct appeal from the criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.518" offset="15529462">And this is a relatively large number I believe with -- in comparison to -- to the other circuits in the country which dealing with federal types of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.527" offset="15569481">I would say, Mr. Justice Stewart that though I haven't made a thorough search from recently reported cases, I would say that at least the first Eighth, Fifth and Ninth Circuits followed the same practice of what you call the two-step proceeding as far as they reported cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="4020.885" offset="16186911">By our count Mr. Justice, only one case which the Court has already acted upon was comparable to the present case in the sense that counsel had acted as advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.935" offset="16223065">There has been a -- a record transcribed and there had been briefing as on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.390" offset="16240933">There are, I think, a number of pending in the bosom of the Court which are comparable to -- to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.271" offset="16260472">So that it -- to repeat myself, I think that this case is different from the other cases which have been here and which -- and which the Court of Appeals has differed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.054" offset="16299551">Mr. Justice Brennan, you mentioned the fact of dissents and sometimes en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.615" offset="16321808">I think, there had been dissents in some cases like this one where there had been full briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.596" offset="16345736">But most of those were cases where the Court of Appeals purported to act under 1915, Section 1915 without a record or without full briefing by counsel as I think there was in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.778" offset="16390457">So, that this is not a repetition problems that you had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.050" offset="16403623">It's -- it's I think a relatively new problem and the Court of Appeals has chosen, the Court of Appeals of the District as the other Circuits have chosen to follow this procedure though they -- they might have if they had thought it desirable followed the procedure which Mr. Justice Steward tells us was followed in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.152" offset="16471960">But we think it was within their allowable discretion in the administration of justice in the District of Columbia Circuit particularly in view of the kind of cases they deal with to follow this kind of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.973" offset="16515218">And the last general facts that I want to mention was raised by a statement of Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.832" offset="16542699">I think we have to look at what our position is here and in the Court of Appeals at the precise issues which counsel raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.362" offset="16576867">And of course, if in our view, counsel has raised in the Court of Appeals the question of whether the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and its judges were not now and never were and could not be constitutional judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.564" offset="16625664">I think it would be right that we could not say that we had to follow brief at this length and called it non-frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.712" offset="16650219">But in our view, when I think this appears clearly if you read both the original memorandum filed by Mr. Gressman in the Court of Appeals and particularly his reply memorandum, he did not raise that issue in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.285" offset="16700479">What he said in our view was, "I will assume" he didn't conceive, he said, "I will assume that the judges of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals who were active in service in 1958 when Congress passed the statute saying that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is a constitutional court."</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.099" offset="16767770">I will assume that they are constitutional judges and that the Court is now a constitutional Article III court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4173.901" offset="16799013">What my only position is as -- as we read his briefs in the Court of Appeals is, that Judge Jackson who retired in 1952 before that statute, he cannot go along with the active judges or the judges who are in service after 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.600" offset="16865782">And as to that narrow issue which was the issue that he presented to the Court of Appeal --</text>

            <text syncTime="5074.175" offset="20400044">The -- the issue that he did raise was, I think, frivolous, that is, the issue he did raise was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.709" offset="20422196">And in all these forma pauperis proceedings, Mr. Chief Justice, it's been assumed that counsel had raised those issues after he's got in the record and has -- had a chance to go over it which he thinks should be presented to the -- will be presented to the Court of Appeals on -- on the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.003" offset="20491368">And I think the Court of Appeals could properly rest on the issues which counsel raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.361" offset="20512789">Now, in this case, the petitioner himself in his pro se application raised five points, which Mr. Gressman abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.812" offset="20546644">He said that he didn't think there was any merit to it and he raised two new points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.012" offset="20563466">And so I think the Court of Appeals could properly say that the five points which had been abandoned meet -- were not before them and may not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.053" offset="20599620">So, similarly, I think that they can say that only the two points which he had raised were before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.467" offset="20621249">I don't mean to say that -- in as the case has progressed to this Court that the conviction of any -- of any clerk should be affirmed if without a decision on the -- on the issue as -- as to Judge Jack -- at the -- or should I say as to the -- the broader Judge Jackson issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.664" offset="20694079">I stated in those terms because as the Court will see from our brief, one of our arguments is that Judge Jackson was at least a de facto judge and that therefore, in this case, in which the issue with -- of Judge Jackson's participation was not raised at all on the trial, was not properly before -- would not properly before -- before the Court of Appeals in any -- in any instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.444" offset="20797106">Because it is our position and this is regardless of what maybe thought as to a distinction between an office and the judges' right to hold the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.646" offset="20837961">I think that the rule is -- is clear and I think universal state and federal that with respect to this issue of a de facto judge, it should be raised at the first opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.011" offset="20887385">But as when the -- the party who claims that the judge should not have said, has an opportunity to raise that he should raise at that time and he cannot wait and try the case before the judge, and then on appeal say, "Oh, he had no right say."</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.037" offset="20951542">I think this is true of -- of all the cases which -- which I have been able to see and it was true particularly of the American and foreign case which the Court had last year with respect to Judge Medina because the Government there, at the first opportunity when the opinion came down indicating that Judge Medina had set on the -- on the en banc hearing, the Government immediately filed a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.363" offset="21048822">And so, on that basis at least, we would say that the petitioner here is barred by the principles relating to de facto judges from challenging the authority of Judge Jackson to sit in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.334" offset="21112665">Now, that, of course, would not solve the problem for the future, it would not solve the problem for the cases in which Judge Jackson may be sitting now in which the issue may be raised or for other --</text>
