            <text syncTime="17.364" offset="172805">Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.733" offset="190255">For the second Monday in a row, this Court is faced with a difficult question on the interrelationship of the accrual accounting and the federal income tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="34.404" stopTime="36.719">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>

          <turn speaker="john_b_jones_jr" startTime="36.719" stopTime="424.587">
            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="36.719" offset="250232">But, it was last Monday Mr. Justice Douglas that this Court considered the American Automobile Association case.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.196" offset="272175">And I was trying to recall to the Court that some of the matters which are relevant here will be considered just one week ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.945" offset="307179">At 17 years ago, this Court in the Dixie Pine Products case and in the Security Flour Mills case laid a rule which was -- which has been universally followed to the effect that when the taxpayer contest a tax which is deductible for federal income tax purpose and does not pay that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.319" offset="412609">That it would be contrary to the principles of accrual accounting in our federal income tax law to permit him to deduct that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.718" offset="450226">The question today is in a sense of refinement to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.276" offset="468511">What is the rule to be followed where the taxpayer pays the tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="96.755" offset="490350">Perhaps, under -- as in this case, under violent protest but nonetheless pays the tax, but then -- and then goes on to contest in the appropriate forum his liability for that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.531" offset="541445">Position which the Government is urging is that payment is a very important matter, one that is not made likely in the business world.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.220" offset="572270">And that ones payment is made, the position of the parties has changed considerably.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.380" offset="592854">That change should be reflected in the tax accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.215" offset="616260">In this case, the respondent has been described by the Second Circuit as a well-known public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.292" offset="648547">It has large real estate holdings in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.881" offset="666937">For the years 1946 through 1950, the respondent contested the liability alleged to be owing one hundredths of parcels of real estate which he owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.173" offset="724093">The settlement for all five of these years, which reached in 1951, this case presents to the Court the question of the tax treatment for 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.246" offset="772368">However, if this Court will determine what was the appropriate accounting at the end of the tax year in question all of the other questions ini the case were fall into place.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.054" offset="827538">Now, I call to the Court's attention a stipulated example which is printed in perfusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.060" offset="851571">It's in the record page 5, petitioner's brief page 5, respondent's brief page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.968" offset="879261">This example has -- has been agreed by all parties and by all the courts which have considered this matter to be one which brings out with full clarity the true issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.704" offset="930147">The stipulated example takes the year 1949, but this would -- the same thing would be true as to any of the other years of the tax years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.796" offset="970585">On January 25, the respondent would receive a notice from the City Tax Commission that he owed in respect of certain property a tax of $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.358" offset="1020844">Within a short period thereafter, the respondent was required to file what amounted to a -- a protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.076" offset="1055640">And in this protest, which is admittedly a bona fide protest of the tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.888" offset="1078941">The respondent would admit that on his estimated value, a true tax would be $85.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.776" offset="1110497">But, respondent denied any liability in excess of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.308" offset="1128573">Now, in terms of the stipulated example, it's assumed that this administrative protest was unsuccessful which at by and large was.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.870" offset="1162846">Then in -- on May 25, the $400 tax was assessed by the appropriate authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.047" offset="1195551">Then, October 1st, was the payment dates for the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.987" offset="1219271">On that date, responded paid the $400.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.531" offset="1233481">Now, he did this under a violent protest and for the stated purpose of avoiding levy, seizure, penalties, interest and all of the problems that come to people who don't pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.001" offset="1283427">And I want to be very careful that nothing I say later in this argument would give any indication that the Government contest that this respondent was acting in anything other than good faith in making that type of protest and that the reasons for making their payment are as stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.758" offset="1358451">Then on October 25, the respondent would commence in the New York Supreme Court certiorari proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.522" offset="1393455">And in these certiorari proceedings, it would admit as it did earlier liability for $85 of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.494" offset="1425324">It would deny liability for the rest.But since it had paid the money, the obvious relief sought was it would be refunded the $15 which it had paid as tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.984" offset="1475271">Now, those are all of the events which happened in the tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.503" offset="1493347">Looking at the books of the company, at the end of -- in this case, 1949, what is the appropriate accounting treatment?</text>
            <text syncTime="358.016" offset="1535457">Well though, as I see it, there would be three ways that this could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.417" offset="1553011">Perhaps, the soundest in the long run would be to say, "Well, this is such a contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.178" offset="1572133">We'd just have to hold the books open and see how things come out."</text>
            <text syncTime="370.435" offset="1585089">This would be the most accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.376" offset="1592926">But nobody in this Court urges that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.258" offset="1604420">This was foreclosed by a number of decisions of the Court perhaps Burnet versus Sanford &amp; Brooks would be as good an example as any.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.024" offset="1635453">But the income tax rule requires that we do make an annual estimate if you wish, or the best -- based on the best information possible, an annual determination of the income, so that no one beliefs that you can accurately reflect everything that happened in the year 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.160" offset="1712044">Now, the second possibility would be to say that the payment of $100 was a payment of tax and accrue the entire amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.420" offset="1757080">And say that at the end of the year, the contingency is whether the taxpayer will get a refund of the $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.355" offset="1788844">That is what we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.898" offset="1795009">We do know that he's paid $100.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="424.587" stopTime="426.498">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="424.587" offset="1801697">A refund of a maximum of $15.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_b_jones_jr" startTime="426.498" stopTime="524.190">
            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="426.498" offset="1809324">Excuse me, a refund of a maximum of $15.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.673" offset="1822072">Now, this is the position which the Commissioner advised respondent to take a published and announced ruling on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.467" offset="1853210">It's the method which was followed in taxpayer's books, it's a method that the Government is urging in this case, it's a method which the Court of Claims has decided should be followed, it was a method to the District Court accepted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.471" offset="1909217">The Second Circuit held for the third possibility, which I'll now discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.582" offset="1933667">The third possibility would be to say that the Dixie Pine products and Security Flour Mills cases say that whenever taxes is -- is in dispute, we will never, under any circumstance, record an amount until that dispute is settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.189" offset="2004093">And under these principles, he would in the tax year accrue an expense of $85 and in effect hold the $15 in suspense until the litigation was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.698" offset="2054144">This is the view which the Second Circuit adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.194" offset="2068146">Now, I stop short of the last step of the stipulated example because I wish to focus the attention of the Court on the end of tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.447" offset="2101164">In fact, in 1951 under the stipulated example, there was a determination of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.593" offset="2129795">The tax liability was found to be $95.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.393" offset="2148916">This meant that the taxpayer had overpaid his taxes $5.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.582" offset="2165739">But it also meant that the taxpayer owed the remaining $10 out of the 15.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="524.190" stopTime="526.325">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="524.190" offset="2200116">But he already paid that amount.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_b_jones_jr" startTime="526.325" stopTime="593.746">
            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="526.325" offset="2208684">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.654" offset="2209938">He had already paid that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.157" offset="2215999">But, in effect, the -- if the item was in suspense under some method of accounting, it was supposing at that time as being forever applied to the tax liability, there was no further litigation possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.467" offset="2273259">Now, in the refund suit in this case, the taxpayer said that the method it followed in this returns in the tax years was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.902" offset="2314951">It should now in 1951 when it settled five years of tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.748" offset="2334386">So a reading must considered that we're asking it to take a deduction five times $10.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.659" offset="2358000">The taxpayer says that in effect, it should deduct the $10 which is unsuccessfully contested only in the later year.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.177" offset="2392064">And the Government on the other hand says that the method you treated it on your tax return is what is required by the annual accounting system for income tax purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.289" offset="2432502">The way you correct your adjustment which is now shown to have been slightly erroneous is to take the $5 which is refunded to you back into income.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.746" offset="2478373">In other words, the -- the Government's position is, that you treat this taxpayer just as though he were a cash basis taxpayer?</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.234" offset="4688332">Now, we -- we would urge on the Court very strongly that the question is as the Government has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.876" offset="4714872">A careful reading of the Second Circuit opinion, well, I believe, convinced the members of the Court that the Second Circuit even though it reached the result contrary to the Government, did not put great weight on the fact that this payment was involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.139" offset="4775894">Now, I suppose it's very hard to describe a voluntary payment of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.035" offset="4795538">I suppose if we had a payment of tax without adequate enforcement, there would be very few payments of tax and perhaps if there were no enforcement, it could be described as voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.592" offset="4837752">But to attempt to go in to the motive of a person making a payment of tax or give the Government an impossible job of administration, not only are there hundreds of taxing statutes with all kinds of sanctions to compel payment but also suppose under this case, suppose another New York City taxpayer comes in and says, "Well, I know that those are penalties but that wasn't the reason I made payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.064" offset="4931584">I made payment because we had extra cash around and it seemed to us sound a business judgment to pay the tax, get it back with 6% interest which would be -- would fit our purposes better."</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.223" offset="4980276">I assume that no one ask for the subjective test but I'm sure that this Court does not wish to be put in the position or to put the Government in the position of going in each payment and determining how willing the payment was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.813" offset="5046627">So, this brings us back to the real issue which we -- we perhaps discuss completely whether payment in the tax year itself brings about accrual under the accrual system of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.817" offset="5098663">Even though at that time, there is a contest pending which may resolve in a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.475" offset="5121233">Now, this is a question on which men may differ as indeed the court below has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.824" offset="5142653">But we think that if you look at the real principles underlying Dixie Pine and Security Flour Mills, you will -- you will agree that the -- what we are looking for is where is the contingency?</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.114" offset="5191868">What is contingent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.670" offset="5198033">And at the end of the tax year in this case as in other cases arise here, the contingency is, is this taxpayer going to get his money back?</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.570" offset="5233664">And if we permit this method of accounting, we are holding the wrong question in suspense.It's not whether he's going to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.032" offset="5263548">He's paid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.972" offset="5267310">He doesn't owe any tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.612" offset="5273788">And if it -- and if he -- for some strange reason, the dispute has never terminated, which method will reflect it better?</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.446" offset="5301164">It would be the method that recognizes where the cash dollars are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.560" offset="5317569">The city has the dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.175" offset="5344110">Now, I don't want to -- to claim that Dixie Pine and Security Mills compel this result.I don't believe they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.284" offset="5380472">And it would be hypocritical perhaps because the Government has often and court cases urged the opposite result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.680" offset="5406072">But let me say that a reading of those two opinions which are quite briefed will make it clear to the Court that in both -- in both decisions, the Court was quite aware of the fact that the tax had not in fact been paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.512" offset="6193403">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.678" offset="6210121">There is a single question involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.178" offset="6224123">The question is the proper year for the deduction of contested, litigated, unadmitted real property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.286" offset="6280547">The Government is -- has misstated the issue 20 odd times in its brief where it refers to this contest litigation as a suit for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.121" offset="6339897">There has been no such thing as a suit for refund of local taxes in the State of New York since 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.888" offset="6386918">This proceeding starts as a contest of a -- of a tentative assessment of value of real property taxes and application for correction of the assessed valuation is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.846" offset="6458807">That is an absolute prerequisite for any contest in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.611" offset="6477824">If that is not filed, there can no suit ever be brought on any ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.293" offset="6496528">The tax will become final and owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.952" offset="6511156">That has to be followed up by a certiorari proceeding filed before the 25th of October of the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.118" offset="6555878">When that is filed its certiorari to the Tax Commission to bring before the Court the proposal of assessment, it is the -- the assessment is -- is not a valid, fixed finalized thing until after this litigation is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.024" offset="6639470">So, the precise question in this case is whether while such a litigation is pending to determine if there is any tax and if there is a tax to the contested amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.641" offset="6693909">If there is any tax, the amount thereof whether a payment made under the circumstances related here will accelerate the time for deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.918" offset="6739048">Now, the facts as -- as have been related are substantially accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.108" offset="6759842">Actually, to simply the matter, reference was not made to the fact although it is stipulated and in the record, it was not made to the fact that the payment is in to installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.569" offset="6809684">The first installment is due October 1 of the tax year 1949 in the illustrative example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.060" offset="6835597">The second installment is due April 1 of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.187" offset="6856077">Each installment was paid, it was paid because if you do not pay that tax as bills, although it as not yet determined or fix or finalized, if you do not pay it, a lean -- leans attached, the property can be seized and sold to satisfy the lean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.386" offset="6936952">There is a compulsion there, an economic compulsion that makes it very practical to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.465" offset="6961194">That gets the moneys into the city -- into the city treasuries in regular order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.753" offset="6986376">That enables the city counsel to assert the proper tax rate because it knows by the time it does that exactly how much is in contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.339" offset="7028694">Only for the application for correction has been filed, admitting tax liability which is irrevocably admitted there, that's the $85, only then have you any remainder that can possibly be in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.124" offset="7087835">Now, the -- the taxpayer has claimed the deduction for the $85 in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.981" offset="7123257">It claims that no further amount is deductible until some tax is validated, finalized in a pending litigation and that did not occur in this case until 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.006" offset="7175398">At which time, the Court's said you owe $10 more, a payment has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.900" offset="7194937">But that payment was no different from the payment in the Rosenman case or the Lewyt in the Second Circuit, the issue that wasn't brought up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.822" offset="7226702">That is a deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.585" offset="7233703">It's a payment in advance of a determination of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.349" offset="7248750">It can't be a payment of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.336" offset="7264737">The -- the reason -- the Government bases its case upon the reasoning of the Court of Claims in the Chestnut Securities case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.474" offset="7297233">In the Chestnut Securities case, the facts were identical as far as the issue is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.322" offset="7332655">There were disputed taxes from 1936, 1937, and 1938, a dispute that it did not terminate until 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.804" offset="7366614">In 1942, the taxpayer lost his case and owed the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.696" offset="7386154">It paid the taxes in 1940 and attempted to deduct that amount its 1940 returned, the Government said, "No."</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.505" offset="7413426">The Commissioner's position at that time and its position in several of these cases was the same, was it you should relate the amount back to the year for which the tax was asserted, a position untenable completely so under the Security Flour Mills doctrine of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.596" offset="7485733">The -- when the -- consequently, when the case got tried in the Court of Claims in the Chestnut Securities, when it got tried, the Government shifted its position adopting Dixie Pine and said, "Yes, 1940 is still not the right year but it's 1942."</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.602" offset="7545814">That is the precise position that the respondent is now taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.366" offset="7560861">It's taking the position the Government originally took.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.773" offset="7574444">In the Court of Claims, in the Chestnut Securities case, announced a rule of accrual accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.826" offset="7606627">It said accrual cannot survive payment so far as the deter is concern, and it said that that was within its understanding of the terminology of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.799" offset="7658559">Now, the respondent had a case involving that's been referred to of 1938, 1939 and 1941.Disputed taxes of 1938, 1939, finalized in 1941 and attempt to take the deduction in 1941, the Government disallowed it, we brought suit in the Court of Claims for a refund for that year on the ground that the tax -- the disputed amount finalized in that year was then deductible, the identical question that had been involved in Chestnut Securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.958" offset="7767228">Now, in Chestnut Securities, there is no evidence of record whatsoever concerning accrual accounting, nothing in the record, nothing in the brief of either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.585" offset="7805680">But in the Consolidated Edison case of 1938 and 1939, evidence was adduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.190" offset="7828146">Evidence was put in so that the Court found the facts respecting accrual accounting and the effective cash.Cash had -- flow of cash has absolutely nothing to do with the accrual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.740" offset="7882376">Accrual can precede, coincide with or survive payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.111" offset="7903796">Payment has nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.164" offset="7912051">The instances of accrual surviving payment are legion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.754" offset="7930337">It's the foundation in the backbone of accrual accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.664" offset="7946010">All prepaid expenses deferred charges to future operations or depreciation deductions 40 years after payment are instances of accrual surviving payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.615" offset="7989791">Inventories are -- where the purchases are not deducted in the year in which they're paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.230" offset="8012257">The -- the Government won't permit tax returns for inventories are employed except on the accrual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.078" offset="8047679">The -- the whole fundamental concept of accrual is -- is the -- is the antithesis of the cash, receipts and disbursements theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.041" offset="8095535">The result of that was that the Court of Claims found as a fact in the -- found facts in the Consolidated Edison case respecting accrual accounting and the effect of the flow of cash and found them in the terms of this illustrative example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.830" offset="8154676">Those findings of fact for the convenience of this Court are reproduced as Exhibit 2 -- appendix 2 of respondent's brief, page 55 my associates says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.318" offset="8216639">Now, the Court of Claims in the Consolidated Edison case, however, had this to say when it came to reach its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.554" offset="8257599">It said, "We do not hold that accrual cannot survive payment."</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.869" offset="8274840">They said, "What we hold is the payment of an item which is otherwise accruable in the taxable year accrues the item."</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.237" offset="8312351">Now, we couldn't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.333" offset="8320711">If an item is otherwise accruable in the taxable year, it's otherwise accruable in the taxable year and you have no need to refer the payment or to anything else in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.630" offset="8361880">We sought to review this decision but there was no conflict at the time and this Court did not allow our application for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.324" offset="8396675">However, the -- since that time, a conflict has a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.697" offset="8414124">The conflict has a reason not in the -- in the frame that the Government puts the picture not where there has been a payment of a tax and then he suit for refund because the payment of a tax where tax is finalized and paid is customarily and admission of that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.938" offset="8499075">And as an admission of liability, a proper basis for accrual that by the way is the basis for the decision of the Court in the Western Cartridge case which I will discuss in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.591" offset="8553723">But the Court did decide in the Northern District -- the District Court of the Northern District of Ohio in the Standard Oil of Ohio case that the accrual can -- can of course survive payments and that the Chestnut Securities doctrine was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.941" offset="8627179">Now, in that case, you had some excised taxes, excised taxes, federal excised taxes on oil from 1932 and 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.076" offset="8671692">The Commission of Internal Revenue does not have to send a notice of deficiency for excised taxes and he just assessed them as a jeopardy assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.535" offset="8717563">The taxpayer litigated this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.999" offset="8727385">The propriety of that tax liability contested it until 1947 when he lost his case in the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.135" offset="8763956">He deducted in 1937 the amount when he paid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.413" offset="8780988">The Commissioner said, "No, throw it back to 1932 and 1933 the years for which the taxes asserted."</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.787" offset="8806484">And of course, that's wrong under the Security Flour Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.475" offset="8825292">And then the taxpayer deducted it in 1947 when the contest finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.042" offset="8851519">This time, the Commissioner said, "No, it belongs back in 1937 under -- under Chestnut Securities."</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.178" offset="8880044">The accrual cannot survive payment so the issue was precisely before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.665" offset="8901987">And what did the Court say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.372" offset="8908884">The Court said the rule to be uniformed should follow the straight rule, laid down in Dixie Pine and Security Flour that all events do not occur within the taxable year that fix the amount and the fact that tax liability until the litigation has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.886" offset="8974921">Then the Court observed, after all, payment is not really one of the events which fix the amount or the fact of the -- tax liability and the final adjudication is the last to those events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.064" offset="9031659">The -- the Government has -- has urged that there's some converse of a claim of right doctrine involved here that cash should be followed because it's definitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.138" offset="9099891">When you receive cash, it has to be income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.229" offset="9108250">Therefore, when you pay cash out, it must be a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.685" offset="9122147">Utterly inconsistent with accrual accounting concepts but, it's also inconsistent because it isn't the convert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.789" offset="9158510">This case is not the converse of the Claim of Right doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.061" offset="9179617">This is a disclaimer of deduction and its -- its opposite or converse would be a disclaimer of right and that has been litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.782" offset="9218487">That was litigated in this Ohio Corporation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.290" offset="9232488">In that case, the taxpayer had been compelled by state law to take -- to receive moneys which he said it didn't belong to it and sought to have a law declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.175" offset="9276061">But the Commission said, you have received cash under color of title, if not claim of right something, you have received cash and you must be taxable on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.533" offset="9317543">But the Court disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.608" offset="9325798">The Court said, "We do not think that when a taxpayer is compelled by state authority over its protest to retain possession temporarily of funds, he can't be charged with having income on that account."</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.971" offset="9371251">The cases of Dixie Pine and Security Flour dealt with deductions from income and held that a taxpayer may not accrue and expense the liability for which is contingent and is contested by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.685" offset="9426108">The problem in the present case concerns income rather than a deduction but we think the same principle applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.784" offset="9450559">If as a matter of law a deduction is not accruable, if the liability as contingent and contested by the taxpayer, similarly, income is not accruable if the right thereto is contingent being denied and contested by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.355" offset="9508760">We would contend that just as for a taxpayer who receives moneys is because of his disclaimer of right not taxable on them, so a taxpayer who denies a liability -- who denies a liability and who disclaims a deduction cannot be compelled to take the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.886" offset="9582947">Now, there's a variation between tax accounting and recognized principles of accounting in respect of the protection of the revenue aspect where an item is contingent under general -- generally recognized principles of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.083" offset="9675734">You will use a reserve approach and accrue something to measure that and bring the addition to the reserve or the charge to the reserve in the current year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.883" offset="9718888">You have that for reserve for intermission damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.896" offset="9734980">All sorts of reserves in that kind which are not recognized for tax purposes although they are for accounting purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.773" offset="9766431">The Congress in enacting Section 462 sought to bring those to closure together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.451" offset="9797151">It sought to permit in 462 the deduction of some of this contingent liability provision -- provision for those things in the year of the transaction gave rise to the liability.But, and if later repeal that section, it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.860" offset="9862771">But it's a particular significance to note that the Congress said even as to Section 462, it shall not reach the type of contingent liability that is in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.866" offset="9910836">It's specifically excluded litigated matters from the reach of 462 and let them to United States versus Anderson, all the events must occur to fix the amount and effect of liability before you can have a deduction, to Chestnut Securities that a -- a contested item must await the outcome of the litigation before it can mature, and the Security Flour Mills that each year stands on its own basis.</text>
