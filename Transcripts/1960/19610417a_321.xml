            <text syncTime="13.584" offset="157759">Mr. Sigal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin C. Sigal</label>
            <text syncTime="15.812" offset="166640">Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.454" offset="193181">The National Labor Relations Board in this case held that the petitioner violated Section 8 (b) (4) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act, as it appeared prior to amendment in 1949, by inducing and encouraging the employees of independent contractors to engage in a concerted refusal to work with an object of forcing the independent contractors to cease doing business with the General Electric Company and in order that the petitioner cease and desist from that conduct, not only as to these independent contractors but as to any other -- as to the employees of any other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.782" offset="386487">Now, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.871" offset="394846">The petitioner represents and there at that time, the production and maintenance employees of the General Electric Company at its Appliance Park plant near Louisville, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.828" offset="446673">There were about 10,000 employees altogether at the plant at that time than -- of which the petitioner represented about 7600.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.891" offset="486902">The principal products of this plant are electrical appliances such as dishwashers, dryers, washers, room air-conditioning units and appliances of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.807" offset="542595">Now, the Appliance Park plant consists of a collection a collection of 13 buildings on a large tract of land, consisting about 1000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.979" offset="583241">Six of the buildings are used directly for production purposes and the others for servicing the production processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.226" offset="624306">Access to the plant is obtained by five road ways crossing a culvert which surrounds the plant and these roadways are called gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.373" offset="672893">Most of the employees, the customers and others wanting to enter the plant do so by way of these roadways.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.527" offset="705494">Now, in 1958 and from time to time prior to that, the company had entered into contracts with independent contractors for work to be done on its buildings in this -- on this site and on the grounds as well and the work consisted of general maintenance work and also for installation, repair and alteration of the facilities in the plants and most important, work in converting to the manufacturer of new models of these various appliances such as retooling, rearrangement of conveyors and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.557" offset="881560">Some of this work had been done and it could be done by the employees of General Electric if they were available at the time and there was also a unique competitive system within the company by which one of the departments or service department bid on certain types of alterations and maintenance work.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.635" offset="981870">And if their bid was lower than that of the independent contractor, they obtained the work otherwise it went to an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.692" offset="1018128">Now, in 1954, the company had issued instructions that one of these five gates, namely which was numbered 3-A to be used only by the employees of the independent contractors whereas the other gates could be used by its own employees and also by the employees of suppliers, other customers and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.620" offset="1121886">Now, the reason for this action was that there had been a number of strikes of the craftsmen of the -- in the employees of the independent contractors which had involved the employees of GE and therefore, they set aside this particular gate for the exclusive use of the employees of the contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.329" offset="1204642">Now, this gate was of course used by any contractor and not just by those who happen to be involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.899" offset="1234944">Now, at the time of the strike which occurred in this case -- which occurred in July of 1958, there were -- contracts had been given to 12 independent contractors, half of whom had already started their work on those particular contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.659" offset="1314043">Most -- one of them, they worked on -- one of them had gone -- it begun as far back as January of 1958, none had gone back before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.908" offset="1355003">However, there were a couple of these contractors who had worked on these premises on other contracts from time to time over a period of two, three, or four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.653" offset="1413935">As to the other contractors, they hadn't even begun doing the work which they had contracted to do for General Electric at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.202" offset="1652172">They said as a matter of fact at that time that the reason they set it up was to insulate their employees from the employees of the independent contractors who had been engaged up to that time in about 22 jurisdictional strikes up to -- from the time the plant opened which was only about four or three years earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.144" offset="1743914">I don't think they had anything like that in mind as to -- as the problem arose in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.478" offset="1769305">Now, as to the employees of these contractors, only about half of dozen had testified and three of them said that they had begun -- worked only two days before the strike in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.130" offset="1839940">Two others that said that they had began to work at -- after the strike began and one or two testified they -- their work had gone on for about six months or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.509" offset="1889364">That's all the testimony there was as to the length of work by the employees of the independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.837" offset="1922696">Now, the work done, as I indicated earlier, was done primarily on the buildings and, in the buildings rather, in which the strikers worked and there was no building, no permanent building for the contractors themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.122" offset="2003884">Now, perhaps it would be helpful just to examine for a moment the map which appears after page 170 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.276" offset="2068459">You'll note that this has -- the tract of land is rectangular.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.106" offset="2135751">Now, gate around -- but the middle of that right hand side, you'll note letter A.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.996" offset="2163336">That was a gate intended for the employees and visitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.240" offset="2184338">Above that was Gate B -- was gate number 3 -- that is B -- it was gate number 3 and then above that is C which is 3-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.674" offset="2230105">Now, that is the gate which is involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.149" offset="2251943">Now, when the employees of the independent contractors went into that gate, they turned left and a number of them went to work in the first building, in building number 1 and a number of them went almost the whole length of that tract and went to work in building number -- which is marked here as building number 5, 5 dealt with -- manufactured household refrigerators, 1 manufactured the home laundry equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.267" offset="2408469">Now, when the -- well, I should note also that in addition to these three entrances, there's one on the far left corner of this tract, that was a gate for employees and there's one at the top of that rectangle which is also a gate which is a -- take gate where truckers came in, employees of suppliers and a gate through which the product of the company was taken out by the employees of truckers and other -- and customers and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.727" offset="3694320">There was no attempt, no effort on the part of the pickets to halt the operations of any contractor at any place other than at appliance part and the trial examiner so found and there is so -- and the Board adopted that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.692" offset="3774151">Now, most of the employees of the independent contractors observed the line and did not go through.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.156" offset="3979995">During the strike, the company made it very clear through use of radio and television and so forth that it was continuing the operation of a plant and there was -- was open for anybody who wanted to do business with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.515" offset="4033390">And as a matter of fact about 5000 employees altogether did go through the -- to work in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.433" offset="4073096">That is about 3000 of the non-bargaining unit before and about 2000 of those of the bargaining unit did go in and the plant operated to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.826" offset="4114683">Now, at the hearing before the trial examiner, the representative of the general counsel made -- was quite explicit in saying that the -- if the contractors and their employees had used the same -- that is the employees of the independent contractors, had used the same gate as the other employees, there would have been no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.853" offset="4218755">It was a bit no unfair labor practice, and the case, as the general counsel presented it to the trial examiner, rested on the distinction between the separate gate set aside for the -- the employees of the independent contractors and the shared gate which was of course the other four gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.238" offset="4304332">Now, the trial examiner found specifically that the pickets made it clear that their dispute was with the General Electric Company only and that there was no effort to halt the operations of any of the independent contractors anywhere outside that project and he concluded that the object of the picketing at Appliance Park was to halt the operations of the struck plant, that is a GE plant, by appeals directed selectively to the company's employees, to the consuming public and to the employees of neutral employers who were transporting materials in and out of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.229" offset="4468276">And he concluded, after an exhausted review of the precedents, that this was clearly valid primary activity and there was no violation of 8 (b) (4) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.819" offset="4526686">The Board reversed the conclusions of the trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.798" offset="4550614">It adopted his findings and sub -- certainly, didn't set aside any findings of his specifically and held that the -- the -- without expressing any rationality for -- rationality for its action that the object of the petitioners was to enmesh the employees of the independent contractors in its dispute with GE which object was shown by picketing the reserved gate and making oral appeals to those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.920" offset="4703065">That was the entire statement of the Board for -- reason for reversing the trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.194" offset="4740159">No other justification or rationality was expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.372" offset="4756877">It issued its order for the petitioners to cease and desist not only from this conduct with respect to the employees of independent contractors, but for the employees of every other contractor, customer and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.714" offset="4826258">The court upheld the Board – no the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.890" offset="4858964">Now, the issue in this case as it is framed by the briefs here is as we see it or at least as we see it, is follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.938" offset="4907133">This is permissible under Section 8 (b) (4) (A), deliberately, to induce employees or customers, suppliers and others who perform services for a primary employer to refrain from rendering services to -- for the benefit of the primary employer at his place of business during a labor dispute between a primary employer and his employees.</text>
