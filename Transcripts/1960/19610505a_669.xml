            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="5.403" offset="124949">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.000" offset="135398">In the time remaining to me, I should like, if I may, to make a few more comments on the threshold in forma pauperis question and then to pass on to the merits of the questions involved in Judge Jackson sitting at the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.401" offset="208959">What I would like to say on the issue of in forma pauperis appeals, I mentioned yesterday and that is in on our view, the standard of review given in these cases is no different from that to which a paid appellant or an indigent who has been granted leave by the trial court is entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.419" offset="293073">The only difference is that in those cases, the issue on the merits does not come before the Court of Appeals ordinarily until after argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.673" offset="334033">The judges don't know about the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.409" offset="341034">They don't have the kind of conferences that this -- this Court has, but that does not mean that if the issue did happen to arise at a preliminary stage, at some interlocutory stage that comparable action would not be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.903" offset="394951">Now we have in a case cited in our brief for another point, an example of that which I would like to tell the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.998" offset="419401">It doesn't happen to be a criminal case, it's a civil case but it bears on -- on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.705" offset="438209">It's the Boomhower case, 220 F.2d 488.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.867" offset="454823">It was in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia about five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.256" offset="472377">There, the appellant, the issue on the merits was very similar to the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.180" offset="492126">Judge Robert Wilkin of Ohio, after he'd retired for disability had sat in the District Court here and the -- and the appellant claimed that he had no right -- a judge retired for disability had no right to sit in another circuit and the appeal was taken on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.111" offset="563806">Well the appellant apparently did not file a full record and the appellee made a motion to dismiss the appeal, not on the merits, but on the ground that the record was not in -- full one and not proper for the consideration of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.375" offset="612916">Well, what the Court of Appeals did was to dismiss the appeal not only that ground, but they said, we go on to the issue on the merits and since we find nothing of merit in it, we will dismiss the appeal on both grounds, on the ground that the record wasn't properly presented to us or a full record and also on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.405" offset="685014">And I present that as an instance of a case which happens to have come before Court of Appeals at an interlocutory stage and -- and which the Court of Appeals acted on the merits as we think is done in these forma pauperis cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.329" offset="736737">And I'm told, though I cannot cite you specific instances that in the District of Columbia Circuit, there had been cases in which an injunctions pendente lite, where an appellant goes to the Court of Appeals to seek an injunction pendente lite that the Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel Court of Appeals, hearing that injunction pendente lite has said, your issue on the merits has -- your issue has no merit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.304" offset="832554">We will dismiss the appeal or summarily affirm at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.832" offset="846660">I'm also told that in a -- in an immigration case, again I don't happen to remember the name, that the Second Circuit in the deportation matter where an application was made to the Second Circuit for a stay of deportation, the Second Circuit did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.248" offset="904338">They went into the issue of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.322" offset="912697">They said there's nothing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.586" offset="917713">We will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court and therefore, it was unnecessary to consider the issue of a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.517" offset="945403">Now, I -- I mention all these instances in order to indicate that the -- that the difference is that in the -- in the ordinary case, the prepaid appeal, I'll say, the issue doesn't come before the -- the Court of Appeals until after argument -- until argument of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.674" offset="1018023">But if it should happen to come, the Court of Appeals would be entitled to and apparently would do the same thing that's done here and at this point I want to specifically to deny that from our point of view, a statement which Gressman made yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.153" offset="1079986">From our point of view, the Court of Appeals is not limited in relation to dismissing an appeal, to deciding only that the appellant has raised issues which are unreviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.773" offset="1122513">We don't think that's true at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.560" offset="1129618">We think that the Court of Appeals can either dismiss an appeal where there's no absolutely no merit to it or it can summarily affirm and if it's not limited to so called nonreviewable issues.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="266.806" offset="1170578">Well Mr. Davis, how can you say it's the same when they're in the -- the court's in a better position to dismiss and appeal that is taken in the ordinary way after the briefs are filed, but before argument on the ground that is frivolous and -- and presents no real issue than it is when -- when the defendants through appointed counsel in this way, makes his initial representation?</text>

            <text syncTime="297.194" offset="1292100">What I'm saying Mr. Chief Justice is that in this case and in other comparable cases, the -- what the defendant has done through his appointed counsel is not a mere initial representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.239" offset="1336299">He has gone as far as he really could and that the three judges of the Court of Appeals can say that we are satisfied on the materials that have been presented to us in this case, which is a simple case and on the issues which have been presented to us that we don't need anymore argument just as this Court does when a motion to affirm is filed in a direct and sometimes even in a certiorari case where it affirms or reverses without further argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.092" offset="1715702">I -- I just happen to look through the last volumes of F.2d to see any reported case from the other circuits and -- and I found them from the Eighth and the Ninth and the Second and there is a case pending in this Court from the Fifth, which I happen to see in the office and so I -- I knew about that as well as the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.830" offset="1778709">Well I -- I now have passed -- well what -- and what I have to say on this point by saying that in our view, Section 1915 presents a standing mechanism for bringing the matter if the Court of Appeals so wills and the circuits have so willed, bringing it before the court at an interlocutory stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.408" offset="1853001">But that in essence, it is no different from the situation which would happen if other appeals were -- came before the court at the interlocutory stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.493" offset="1885393">I now pass to the -- to the issues relating -- involving Judge Jackson's participation in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.116" offset="1911829">And I think, I should make it clear because I don't think I did yesterday that the Government agrees that subs -- subsumed in the questions presented by the petitioner, are all the issues on the merits relating to Judge Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.914" offset="1967000">We do not think that he -- that the petitioner waived those issues because in our view, he limited the issue that he presented to the three-judge court below, to a single facet and didn't raise all -- all the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.386" offset="2020916">On the other hand, we don't think we that we have waived any defense such as we may have it, as the de facto defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.702" offset="2046203">So we think that if this Court wishes, it can consider the issues on the merit and there is precedent for this in the Pollard case, which is cited at the very end of our brief in a footnote to our conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.706" offset="2094164">The court there said it was unnecessary to pass on the issue whether the Court of Appeals had granted -- improperly denied leave in forma pauperis because on -- they went on to the merits and that is a precedent for doing so here and the Bakelite case which if of course, the very important in the whole issue on the merits as far as Judge Jackson is concerned, the -- this Court there said, we won't pass on the issue of whether we have power to issue a writ of prohibition which has been mooted before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.797" offset="2206595">It said, we can't do it because we decided that even if we did have the power, we wouldn't issue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.334" offset="2224671">And -- and judge -- Justice (Inaudible) specifically said that they were reserving the question of their power.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.232" offset="2248286">So there is precedent for the court for doing that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis M. Shea</label>
            <text syncTime="1580.847" offset="6426728">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.345" offset="6440730">I am here on behalf of the judges of the Court of Claims appearing as amicus curie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.251" offset="6472391">The interest of those judges, I think, is quite evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.845" offset="6490781">The status, unquestioned status of the Court of Claims which has existed for 60 years as an Article III court was first drawn in question in the Bakelite case, dealing with the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and then in the Williams case, it was held a legislative court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.440" offset="6573119">The court relying on the dictum in the Bakelite case and saying there was no basis for differentiation for these purposes between the two courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.719" offset="6610213">The 1953 legislation relating to the Court of Claims and the 1958 legislation relating to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.067" offset="6663607">Now, may I make this suggestion to Your Honors that it seems to me that the clearly wise policy standing behind the settled view of this Court that you should not reach constitutionally issues, where case can be decided on narrower grounds, it seems to me that that policy doesn't exist at least in full measure in the case which is here before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.591" offset="6805713">The issue which is squarely presented, as the Chief Justice has noted, raises very considerable problems with him in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.370" offset="6852838">If anybody has the full scope of experience needed to settle this issue, it is this body and it seems to me, we're in a narrow of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.928" offset="6911039">The validity of the statute relates to the problem of the proper administration of justice, so there is reason to dispose of that issue and not to avoid it, which was if one does not find in dealing with constitutional issues under the broad grants of public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.664" offset="7009991">Now, if the court please, I should like first to turn to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.398" offset="7040920">The Congress in 1953 expressly declared that the Court Claims was constituted as an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.863" offset="7090866">To be sure of legislative history indicates, as Mr. Davis suggests, that the Congress had carefully examined the Williams case and the legislative history behind the earlier statutes and had concluded that Williams was wrong and it intended in that statute to declare that the Court of Claims had at least since the repeal of the appending provision noted in the Gordon case in an Article III court but further that they were mistaken in that or not, as held by this Court in Postmaster General v. Early, if the language of the Act can be given prospective effect and clearly it seems to me in this case it can be given prospective effect then it will be given prospective effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.823" offset="7322624">Now it seems to me that it would be rather clear that if the Congress today constituted a court and invested it with Tucker Act jurisdiction and declared that it was exercised in Article III power in so doing, that that would be a valid act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.056" offset="7423561">In my view, quite clearly it would be investing in that court, Article III jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.429" offset="7449057">Quite clearly it seems to me, Tucker Act jurisdiction arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.892" offset="7486986">I have to think of also that it involves cases to which the United States is a party as that phrase was used in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.538" offset="7529514">But whether that be true or not, I suppose there can be no question of the fact that Congress could invest Tucker Act jurisdiction in constitutional courts even if it might at the same time, elect to invest it in legislative courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.708" offset="7622196">Indeed, it has invested in the District Courts and therefore, if it is within the congressional elect to determine which power they've exercised, Article I or Article III power, where they expressly declare that they have exercised Article III power, it seems to me that that should be an end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.620" offset="7717804">Now, if they could, if they could today establish such a court and invest it with such power and declare finally, it was Article III power, with utmost respect for Mr. Gressman's view, it seems to me that to suggest that you have to disestablish the Court of Claims and then reestablish the Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.345" offset="7812786">It seems to me that that argument has had substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.857" offset="7826787">That it must be possible to do this in a single act and equally, I -- I must say I find little substance in the suggestion that there's need for reappointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.176" offset="7872031">These judges, as Mr. Davis has pointed out, were -- were appointed by the President, bind with the advise and the consent of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.251" offset="7908394">They were appointed to serve during good behavior and Congress certainly has done everything it could to relinquish if it ever had any right to reduce their compensation to their -- during their term of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.807" offset="7958549">And moreover, may I point out to the Court that the President and the Senate concurred in legislation which certainly contemplated that the existing judges would continue to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.879" offset="8010898">Now, it seems to me therefore that since 1953 certainly, the Court has been an Article III court and the judges are Article III judges, but I think that the Congress' right while I share Mr. Douglas' high regard for members of the court set on the Williams case, I think they were plainly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.700" offset="8114134">This has been the materials for judgment and this I think had been set out in great detail in the Solicitor General's brief in the Pope case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.636" offset="8149870">We put it in capsule form in our brief, but with all the necessary references.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.419" offset="8173066">I invite the Court, as Mr. Davis has and I think Mr. Gressman but certainly Mr. Davis, to review the Williams case and may I, with a broad rush, note the basis why I think that decision was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.041" offset="8247568">In the first place, I think Your Honors will find by review of the legislative history before the original act that those who were managing the Bill, both in it's final form and those who were opposing thought that the option of the election was between either creating a board of commissioners or creating a court under Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.514" offset="8341400">Now to be sure, some of the chase pointed out to -- laid to the Chief Justice that he didn't think it could be an Article III court, it wasn't to be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.600" offset="8381733">But the men who were managing the legislation thought that that was the election that they were making and they elected to make it a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.553" offset="8409631">When this Court in the Gordon case, noted that the court not take jurisdiction because the Court of Claims did not have finality of judgment because of the intervention of the Secretary of Treasury, immediately Congress repealed the offending provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.905" offset="8486954">Immediately this Court changed its rules, so as to provide for appeals from the Court of Claims and the court that did that as you will find from the opinion of Chief Justice Taney which was prepared and later filed in the case with the approval for surviving judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.424" offset="8561037">This Court that time was of the view that it could only take appellate jurisdiction from Article III courts and so it must be assumed that they did believe that they were taking jurisdiction from an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.779" offset="8614536">Moreover, within six years of the Gordon opinion and Kline, the whole subject was reviewed and unmistakably, this Court stated the view that the Court of Claims was an Article III court and reiterated this view over a period of 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.692" offset="8690186">And I ask the Court to note that in 1887, Congress reenacted the basic jurisdictional statute of the Court of Claims and I assume, reenacted it with its gloss on it and the gloss that was on it at that time, was the view of this Court that it contained Article III jurisdiction and was invested in an Article III court and then in Williams, all of this was avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.855" offset="8814843">The Court did not deal with the question as to whether it was an Article III jurisdiction that the Court of Claims is exercising, because they were dealing with cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2206.534" offset="8929468">They said it couldn't have been contemplated that -- that cases involving the United States as a party defendant was within that phrase of the Constitution, because it was well understood at the time that the Constitution was adopted that the sovereign could not sued, he had sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.305" offset="9020583">And -- and it was understood, but it was equally well understood and that it existed in England from the 13th Century, that the sovereign waiver of immunity, well established in England and well established in the colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.735" offset="9078262">And if I may point out to you Your Honors, dealing with cognate problem, Marshall and Madison in the Virginia convention, dealing with the problem of suits involving a state said, of course this doesn't waive the sovereign immunity of the states, but it provides a court and jurisdiction, if the states waive that immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.760" offset="9186408">And this was the view I believe, Your Honors at the time the Constitution was adopted and was so decided in this Court, in the Hitchcock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.940" offset="9227160">It seems to me, I've had to deal with this obviously only in the suggestive way, but I think Your Honors will find on the review of the materials that despite the fact that they were men of great stature on that bench, but in this regard, they were clearly wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.202" offset="9644178">I would like to address myself in my remaining time to this constitutional issue and with particular reference to the 1958 declaration by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.912" offset="9687019">Parenthetically, I might say just as a matter of clarity of the proceeding below that I disagree with Mr. Davis' analysis of the issue that I sought to raise there in these constitutional terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.893" offset="9742921">I think a fair reading of the memorandum will demonstrate that I sought to erase the basic constitutional issue which has been fully developed before the court in the briefs before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.201" offset="9792136">And that it is unfair to single out any particular argumentative statement that may have been made and seek to confine that in terms of an issue raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.284" offset="9832469">In fact, I think this demonstrates better than anything else the desirability at the appellate level below, of having an opportunity fully to brief a basic constitutional issue such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.043" offset="9887535">I think that it's unfair to confine and to limit what was before the Court of Appeals in terms of the issue before it, by any single statement that might have been made and particularly with reference to the fact that we are dealing here with a retired judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.148" offset="9963917">Now whether that has any significance or not, remains to be one of the matters to be considered on full briefing of the issue which has never occurred until we've arrived in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.752" offset="10014386">Now with reference to the de facto doctrine, which is the first line of defense taken by the United States here, I will say only this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.164" offset="10056077">I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter yesterday pointed out the -- the real answer to the de facto defense in this case and that is, as I have developed in my reply brief at length, that the de facto doctrine does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.628" offset="10117935">It does not help where there is a constitutional or a statutory reason why a judge cannot sit in a particular type of case and that is what we have alleged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.728" offset="10178330">What is involved here is the claim that there is there constitutional prohibition against Judge Jackson sitting in an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.996" offset="10219395">And when that type of claim is made, something that goes far beyond any technical defect in Judge Jackson's assignment such as a failure to file his assignment with the office of the clerk of the District Court or to – to -- a failure to obey some technical aspect of the statutory assignment provisions, but where we have this --</text>
