            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="9.489" offset="141354">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.338" offset="152743">Yesterday afternoon, I finished discussing the facts in the Nathanson case, the Labor Board case in which this Court denied, I think, quite properly, the National Labor Relations Board a priority in a bankruptcy proceeding for a backpay award.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.283" offset="228498">The backpay award in that case had the priority been recognized, would have been -- you had exclusively to the benefit of each of the individual employees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.762" offset="262457">Now, it was exclusively on the basis of the Nathanson decision, as I read the opinion in the court below, that the -- a court below found a fatal infirmity in Small Business Administration's insistence that it was entitled to a priority in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.327" offset="336645">But the -- the obvious distinction that leaps to mind so far as the comparison of the Nathanson case with our case is concerned is that in our case, unquestionably, three-fourths, three-fourths of the priority, if recognized, will stay in the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.331" offset="408743">Indeed, the entire recovery of the $12,000 which the Government insists it is entitled to by way of priority in this bankruptcy proceeding, will go to the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.346" offset="444792">It is true that under this separate and contractual arrangement with the bank at sometime, the United States will have to pay over to the bank one-fourth of $12,000 and not, of course, necessarily any of these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.161" offset="492022">These funds are not earmarked to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.915" offset="499022">All of the money collected by the Government, if its priority is recognized is turned into the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.265" offset="528384">I think two-way, a -- a very significant, a very significant distinction between Nathanson and this case is the fact that in this case, we do have conclusive congressional manifestation that the general priority under 3466 recognized in favor of the Government and its agencies as far back as 1797, that this priority was to be preserved intact so far as the SBA was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.180" offset="668087">After the Small Business Administration Act has been on the statute about five years, it was proposed by a Senator to strip the SBA of the priority everybody thought it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.740" offset="722317">Indeed, the priority we all thought it had until the decisions of the court below challenged that priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.598" offset="765785">And Senator Payne introduced in 1958, introduced into the Congress a bill which would, in expressed terms, have deprived the SBA of their priority under Section 3466, the 1797 statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="183.189" offset="836106">There was understandably considerable consternation when this bill was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.530" offset="853452">The SBA objected vehemently and as a result, the bill, in the form of which is -- in which it was introduced, which would've wiped out the governmental priority, which would, in fact, have reached the -- have resulted in the same situation as that required by the decision of the court below in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.511" offset="933386">That bill was never reported out.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.442" offset="945089">Instead, a much water down substitute was finally passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.917" offset="967032">And in this 1958 Amendment, with the agreement of the Small Business Administration, Congress provided, in effect, that the Federal Government's priority under 3466 should be made to yield only to certain state and local tax lanes but not -- but not to the claims of the general unsecured creditors who are involved in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.072" offset="1075702">We think too that a -- another -- a third -- a very vital distinction between Nathanson and this case is that in Nathanson, obviously, none of the moneys which would've been recovered by the Board, as I pointed out, would have possibly been enable to help sustain the public burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.410" offset="1160965">And because of that, the numerous admonitions of this Court that Section 3466 is to be liberally applied, this Court has pointed in -- in a host of decisions that the mandate of Section 30 -- of 30 -- Section 3466 is -- is broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.939" offset="1239124">It's clear, it's unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.154" offset="1248005">And when it says that the text of the United States shall first be satisfied, that's -- that's expressly what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.675" offset="1270053">And the reason for the broad interpretation, of course, was the need for assuring adequate public revenue to sustain the public burden and to discharge the public debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.377" offset="1304848">Well, in Nathanson this Court wasn't concerned with that broad policy of interpretation, which was essential to apply in order to help secure adequate public revenue because, as I pointed out in Nathanson, no public revenue at all was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.829" offset="1366706">That's not true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.950" offset="1371199">As I pointed out in this case, every cent of that $12,000 goes into the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.972" offset="1387290">It is true that under our contractual arrangement with the bank, at some later date, the bank will get a part of the proceeds of that loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.592" offset="1449775">One other -- one other distinction, I don't want to belabor this point but I feel, I -- I have this --</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.985" offset="4199320">Our third point is that this Court has said that where the allowance of the priority would be plainly inconsistent with other statutes and acts of Congress, it will not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.558" offset="4269641">We believe that the priority here would be inconsistent with the priority statute itself with the Bankruptcy Act and inconsistent with the Small Business Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.385" offset="4348949">Now, I -- I will mention this proposition that the Small Business Administration is not the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.993" offset="4415300">I might start that with the proposition that the -- the Government in its brief says it is now firmly established that a non-incorporated agency of the United States must be considered the -- to be the United States for the purpose of the priority statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.593" offset="4525746">This Court, however, in the -- in the Marxen case, suggested the argument in connection with the FHA that the administrator had been given the power to sue and be sued and -- but the question is not raised as to whether or not that constitutes the Federal Housing Administration a separate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.745" offset="4646327">In the Remund case, United States against Remund, which involved the Farm Credit Administration, the Court found that the Farm Credit Administration was the United States but they did it not on the basis it is not incorporated but on the basis that it did not bear any resemblance to the government corporations or actual separate entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.260" offset="4780387">Here, in addition to the power to sue and be sued in any court to handle its property to adopt the seal, Congress initially set up a revolving fund for the Small Business Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.622" offset="4881847">We contend that the money -- that it also provides that the Small Business Administration shall pay interest to the Treasury on the money that it has drawn from its revolving fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.710" offset="4962200">In this case, if there is a recovery by the Small Business Administration, the money will not be paid to the Treasury of United States, it -- except insofar as it is the custodian, the bank in which Small Business Administration keeps its money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.623" offset="5041821">It does not have to account annually for the funds that are drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.500" offset="5061360">The revolving fund is set up without fiscal year limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.754" offset="5086438">The Small Business Administration simply pays interest on the amount that it has drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.760" offset="5114441">When this goes back in, it will serve to reduce the interest that Small Business Administration pays but it -- it's not, in fact, a payment to the Treasury of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.152" offset="5167940">That is my argument on the proposition that this is a separate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.138" offset="5211930">As I say, I -- I recognized that if it has to be incorporated, this one isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.806" offset="5238575">I submit that it does have all of the powers and stands between the debtor and the United States as it is now set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.963" offset="5287267">Now, my second proposition is that there was no debt due to Small -- to the Small Business Administration at the time of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.277" offset="5340453">At that time, the bank -- the bank was the only payee on the note.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.039" offset="5459571">Small Business Administration had a contract with the bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.067" offset="6647620">To the extent of bank shares, the money recovers will not be available to sustain the public burdens or discharge the public debt, at least a part of it is going to a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.615" offset="6709791">Now, it is for that same reason also inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.162" offset="6744064">We have a number of cases saying that the theme of the Bankruptcy Act is equality of distribution among creditors holding just demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.205" offset="6788159">Here, while the bank will not recover $4000, if the priority is allowed in this case, the bank will recover 75% of its debt, where the other common creditors will receive not more than 2%, if they receive any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.985" offset="6883349">So that the allowance of the priority not only produces a preference or a priority to a common creditor without any superior equities over any of the other creditors but also to the extent that that money is paid over to the bank, it will not be available to sustain the public burdens and discharge the public debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.136" offset="8603878">My answer to that is simply that this is one single claim by the United States -- by the Small Business Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.304" offset="8660616">As their interest may appear, therefore, you must examine the participation agreement in order to determine how their interests do appear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.135" offset="8751940">But then, the -- it is also necessary to determine whether or not a priority is due since it has been claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.368" offset="8792795">I submit that you have to examine the entire document, the whole document, to determine how much is going to be available to sustain the public burdens to discharge the public debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2488.788" offset="10058480">The petition of bankruptcy was filed the Barquist (ph) was adjudicated a bankrupt late in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.728" offset="10086275">The Marxen case can have no applicability under those circumstances because in the Marxen case, the Government's disbursement, the expenditure of federal funds so far as its guarantee of the -- the National Housing Administration contract was concerned and the note thereunder, the federal disbursement, the disbursement of federal funds in that place did not occur until sometime after the filing of the petition of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.650" offset="10178017">Here, as I say, whatever investment the Government made occur, practically a full year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.297" offset="10196511">I would like to touch on -- on the argument that -- that somehow the -- there's a -- a violation of the end line principle of the Bankruptcy Act by allowing the bank to participate in the Federal Government's priority to the extent of 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.129" offset="10255862">It's been suggested that this gives the bank an undue preference over the other general unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.448" offset="10289194">But I do submit that what the United States does with the recovery, it effects and the interests of stimulating small business expansion is really a matter of concern between the United States Government and the private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.753" offset="10338408">There is absolutely no difference between that arrangement and the arrangement between one creditor and the second creditor under which the first creditor tells the second creditor, "Well, I'm going to turnover to you all of the general dividends I get to the distribution of the estate."</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.965" offset="10387205">That no way, prejudice is credit to C, D, E and F.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.896" offset="10398908">They still get the same as they would have if the first creditor had kept his general dividend distribution to himself and he had not turned it over to the second creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.700" offset="10434121">Whatever benefits the second creditor gets, he gets solely at the advantage of the first creditor, not at the other general unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.738" offset="10462333">That's the -- the same situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.879" offset="10470902">The general unsecured creditors are in no way prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.513" offset="10481455">They still get the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.255" offset="10488351">For those reasons and for those that I pointed out earlier, we respectfully submit that the judgment below should be reversed.</text>
