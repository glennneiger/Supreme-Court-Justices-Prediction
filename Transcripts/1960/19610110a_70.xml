            <text syncTime="34.884" offset="242918">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.483" offset="257337">These consolidated cases grow out of the robbery of the Norwood Bank and Banking Company in Norwood, Massachusetts in September of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.187" offset="312090">The petitioner here and two codefendants were indicted on indictments in three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.982" offset="351274">Count 1 charged entry of the bank with the intention to commit a felony in violation of Section 2113 (a) of the Criminal -- Federal Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.202" offset="404146">Count 2 charged robbery at the bank in violation of the same subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.961" offset="423267">And Count 3 charged aggravated robbery, that is that they put the -- they put named persons in jeopardy in the process of committing the robbery named in Count 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.094" offset="479796">One of the codefendants pleaded guilty and testified on behalf of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.154" offset="504038">The petitioner here and another codefendant pleaded not guilty and were tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.582" offset="529742">They were convicted on all three counts and were sentenced to three concurrent sentences, 20 years on Count 1, 20 years on Count 2 and 25 years on Count 3, sentences that I have mentioned to run concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.836" offset="614693">There are, in fact, two separate cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.299" offset="624619">There are two records in this Court but as a matter of convenience, the Government and the petitioner have filed but -- one brief each covering the two cases on a consolidated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.586" offset="681671">Both of these cases arise under separate motions under Rule 35 to attack the sentences as being illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.840" offset="722735">There is no issue here of a new trial, simply a question of an attack upon the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.385" offset="748962">Since the issue and the issues in the two cases are almost unrelated, I think it would be helpful if I turn first to No. 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.329" offset="800684">The issue on that case is simply whether Rule 32 (a), subparagraph (a) of Rule 32 of the Federal Criminal Rules, requires that the trial judge before sentencing ask the accused if he has something to say to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.041" offset="887515">The facts in this case can be quite simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.166" offset="904025">The petitioner did not testify on his behalf at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.078" offset="927640">Subsequent to the conviction, the court held a hearing approximately one week later at -- which it announced that it would impose sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.211" offset="972257">Also at that hearing, it considered two other motions, the motion for a new trial and a motion in arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.640" offset="1001932">I think a fair reading of the record would convince anyone that it is -- it was a somewhat confused hearing with these three matters being interwoven throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.541" offset="1049579">The -- about midway in this hearing, petitioner's counsel made a short statement on petitioner's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.832" offset="1090748">In the -- the thrust of his statement was that petitioner had a number of other criminal matters pending and that he had, as his counsel said, a long road to travel and on that basis, counsel asked that the court be lenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.382" offset="1156890">At the conclusion of this hearing, the judge made a sharply critical statement of the petitioner and of his codefendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.020" offset="1203493">He referred to them as madmen, stated that they deserved no consideration and on two separate occasions, stated that there was not one word that can be said on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.370" offset="1248841">Without interruption, he went on to impose sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.830" offset="1270680">Subsequent to the imposition of sentence, a few days later, he signed the judgment and commitment form, setting forth in effect what we had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.478" offset="1317282">This form stated specifically that the court had asked the petitioner, had asked the accused if he had something to say before sentence was pronounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.487" offset="1381334">In fact, the record is perfectly clear that no such question was ever asked and the Government conceded as much in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.476" offset="1421249">So I think we can proceed on the factual assumption that the -- that no question was ever put to the petitioner in this case by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.493" offset="1465344">In 1959, the petitioner, who was at that time and is still confined at Alcatraz serving these sentences, made a motion under Rule 35 to have the sentence vacated on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.564" offset="1541622">There were two other grounds that are not relevant here because the court limited the grant of certiorari to this whole question of this -- of the interpretation of Rule 32 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="704.338" offset="2920678">Subsection (a) of Rule 32, and it's -- the only -- the last sentence that is relevant here, appears on page 9 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.516" offset="2957458">It reads as follows, "Before imposing sentence, the court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of judgment."</text>
            <text syncTime="726.686" offset="3010121">I think it is worth emphasizing that there are two sub-phrases there, an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.127" offset="3167901">It would have been sufficient to say that he shall have an opportunity to present information in mitigation of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.153" offset="3199979">If that language means anything, we think it simply means that there is to be a personal statement by the accused that if he wishes to make such a statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.638" offset="3537899">The words "shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf" seems to connote a different and more extensive procedure that exist when a defendant moves, requests or act under other sections of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.051" offset="3611564">I would suppose that if one was looking for an analogy to the use of the word "the defendant" in Rule 32 (a), the closes place to look would be Rule 43, which says the defendant has the right to be present throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.103" offset="3683767">Historically, these two rights have been related to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.701" offset="3698186">And in each case, I think, it -- is a -- as a matter of common sense, the right is a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.429" offset="3733086">It's clear beyond any doubt that the right of Rule 43 is not a right to have one's counsel present because that's protected elsewhere, but it's the right to be physically present in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.184" offset="3788152">In short, we say that without going beyond the language of the Rule and its obvious intent, it's a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.970" offset="3827231">The history of the Rule bears this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.132" offset="3847920">The Rule is the natural -- natural evolvement of the historic right of allocution, which developed at or it can be found in the early common law, at least as early as the 17th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.744" offset="3910301">This was a right given to the accused to address the court before sentence was pronounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.243" offset="3940394">Now, this -- it is true that this was a right that grew up at a time when the accused had no counsel, did not have a right to have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.526" offset="3973517">But it is also true that it has survived long beyond the time when the accused did have a right to counsel and therefore, the -- our position is that the substance of the -- of the right is as significant today as it -- as it was in -- in earlier times.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.921" offset="13083042">I just don't know, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.778" offset="13090461">I simply don't know the answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.934" offset="13103104">I think it is clear though in the -- in the federal -- in federal law now that there's no difference of opinion as far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.577" offset="13133720">And I -- I would think the Government would -- would agree on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.239" offset="13152319">On the third part of this case, the petitioners claimed that because of the judge's misdefinition of the crime of aggravated robbery in his charge to the jury that the jury never could have convicted for that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.307" offset="13224626">It is -- the facts, again, are -- are fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.511" offset="13241448">On page 31 and 32 of our brief, we cite the repeated misdefinitions by the court of the crime of aggravated robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.431" offset="13293066">The -- the crime requires a showing that persons have been put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.805" offset="13314591">Yet repeatedly, the court referred to fear as being enough or the use of a dangerous weapon as being enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.671" offset="13350013">Now, with only one of those two factors involved and no showing of jeopardy, the only crime is the crime of simple robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.122" offset="13387839">For that, the maximum sentence is 20 years and our contention is that the court below imposed a -- an excessive sentence by imposing a 25-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.336" offset="13444681">The Government's reply to that is that the only defects which may be attacked in their motion under Rule 35 are those appearing in the common law record, the -- the old judgment rule, the indictment, the plea, the verdict and the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.126" offset="13515839">Well, that's a rule or a limitation that grew up at a time when that was all that was available on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.316" offset="13544678">But in this case, we have the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.937" offset="13555127">There's no -- there's no problem now of -- of knowing what the court below did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.978" offset="13579264">And we suggest that this is a -- a situation where you have to look at the instructions to see what the jury convicted among of, to see what the juries were guilty on Count 3 man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.237" offset="13632345">And that if you do that, you -- you see that it was -- it meant nothing more than a conviction of simple robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.619" offset="13665886">Mr. Justice Stewart in the -- in the Heflin case, I think, made it quite clear that he -- when he thought of going out -- we leave open the question under Rule 35 as to whether you can go outside of the record, clearly not talking about the common law record because he was talking of those things which required a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.274" offset="13760449">In the Ladner case, which I referred to earlier, the Court, I think, made it clear that it was willing to even have a hearing to determine the validity of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.510" offset="13809455">The final point I would like to make is that if this Court remands this case by any of the grounds we have raised, that it seems appropriate that it made it clear to the trial judge that full credit should be given for time already served and that for purposes of good time credits and parole, the sentence should be deemed to run from the date originally imposed, otherwise, it would be completely unfair penalty on him for having raised the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.995" offset="13931395">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="3478.942" offset="14019166">May it please the -- the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.732" offset="14030346">Following the pattern set by the very able counsel for petitioner here, I'll first speak, unless the Court wishes otherwise, on the point raised in No. 70, the question of whether or not, the trial judge here erred when he did not expressly ask the petitioner just before sentencing whether petitioner himself wished to say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.701" offset="14130134">In that connection, there are one or two things I wished to stress even though they have been brought out here in the discussion before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.364" offset="14164825">The first, of course, is that petitioner here was represented throughout his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.082" offset="14187708">He did not plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.323" offset="14192619">He stood trial and had a full trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.728" offset="14202232">And throughout this trial, he was represented by counsel of his own choice, not by court-appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.112" offset="14231803">And his counsel according to the Court of Appeals, which twice mentioned in the fact in its opinion below, was an able, experienced trial lawyer and judging by everything that appears in the record here, he conducted a very alert and vigorous defense and assertion of all the rights of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.585" offset="14313723">The record here shows he took exceptions of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.786" offset="14326471">The record here shows he argued at length on the motion in arrest of judgment and for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.168" offset="14352071">And there's every indication as the Court of Appeals said that he was an able, experienced, confident criminal trial lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.149" offset="14383940">The Court mentioned that twice in his opinion found in the record on page 35, as a matter of fact in a prior decision of the Court of Appeals found in 256 F.2d 484, involving the same defendant but the way this is -- these two motions here are only the last two of four that he has made since he has began serving his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.890" offset="14490937">In this prior opinion, the Court of Appeals again said, "Green was represented by an able and experienced criminal trial lawyer of his own choice."</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.179" offset="14536077">Again, as was brought here, his able counsel spoke on the point of mitigation of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.655" offset="14574007">He spoke in response to a direct question put by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.381" offset="14592920">The judge asked if the conclusion of the arguments and the motion in arrest of judgment and the motion for a new trial, you have anything further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.941" offset="14627088">Now, the record does not expressly show, unfortunately, to whom he was speaking when he said "you".</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.316" offset="14656658">I would assume probably it was counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.857" offset="14666794">At any rate, defendant's counsel then spoke up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.537" offset="14681527">He's -- what he said covers a page and a half in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.229" offset="14696260">He was followed by counsel for the codefendant, who also spoke on the problem of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.473" offset="14721233">In other words, both counsels for both defendants in answer to inquiry by the judge spoke on the problem of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.548" offset="14753520">So far as appears, they said everything it was to be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.816" offset="14766686">By that, I mean the United States Attorney had previously spoke his remarks cover about a page in the record on the question of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.653" offset="14802004">When the two co-counsel spoke here, they answered directly the statements made by the United States Attorney, that is, they pointed out that defendant here was a family man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.611" offset="14845785">He had two minor children and a wife and that whenever he had been able physically to do so, he had supported them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.197" offset="14876191">They also pointed out that this particular defendant was by no means a stranger to the state and federal criminal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.612" offset="14909837">And that if the judge, Judge Ford imposed a long sentence here because of the other pending indictments, because of the fact he was already in the state prison under a conviction, that it would mean substantially that the defendant would spend most of the rest of his life in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.645" offset="14977964">Now, counsel brought that out speaking at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.862" offset="14990817">Another point I want to make is that, so far as we can tell it from the record, and the record I think is fairly convincing, the defendant here was fully confident in every way to cooperate with his counsel in his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.183" offset="15056123">By that, I mean he was a man of 37 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.416" offset="15065004">He was not a juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.019" offset="15071483">He was not senile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.068" offset="15075662">There's no suggestion in anytime there's any impairment of his mental capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.089" offset="15099695">Moreover, as I mentioned, he was not a stranger to courtrooms, criminal trials and court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.342" offset="15124773">He'd been through them all before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.419" offset="15133027">In addition, what's happened since his trial here, gives every indication that in many ways, he's an unusually resourceful and articulate person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.206" offset="15172211">As I've mentioned, since his conviction and since he's going to Alcatraz, he's filed no less than four post conviction motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.918" offset="15211081">Each one, he filed himself, many of them he rolled up the papers in longhand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.805" offset="15230621">He carried them, all four, through the Court of Appeals to the First Circuit and three of them, he brought here asking for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.679" offset="15270118">All the papers he prepared himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.263" offset="15280462">So, there's every indication here that defendant was fully competent and also this record, as a matter of fact, indicates that the defendant was, so to speak, talking and working with his own counsel during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.763" offset="15338454">By that, I mean if you look at the record, you discover the United States Attorney, as I said, spoke about a page in the record about what the sentence should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.981" offset="15383280">The United States Attorney stressed the fact that though the defendant had these two minor children and wife, he never actually supported them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.050" offset="15415568">When the defendant's counsel spoke on this question of the sentence in response to an inquiry from Judge Ford, he made a very significant remark showing that he was not unaware of the defendant's point of view so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.826" offset="15470634">On the record in page 19, he made this remark, notwithstanding what the District Attorney has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.498" offset="15497383">"He," meaning the defendant, "informed me that, he," meaning the defendant "has supported them," meaning his family, "except for the time he was incapacitated".</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.370" offset="15548897">In other words, he was -- he was conferring with his counsel during all this that was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.983" offset="15567287">He was not sitting there tongue-tied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.573" offset="15573661">He was not so shy and bashful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.022" offset="15583483">He was not unaware of what was happening.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="3872.429" offset="15593096">Mr. Kramer, the -- the presupposition of your argument is that in each case, the appellate court, the Court of Appeals normally, eventually this Court, will be called upon to define whether the substantive purposes of 312 (a) are satisfied by the circumstances of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.231" offset="15676270">That's the presupposition of your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_kramer" startTime="3894.387" stopTime="3999.658">
            <label>Mr. Robert Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="3894.387" offset="15680972">That it's certainly the presupposition of what I'm talking about now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.747" offset="15694346">And the reason I do that, Mr. Justice, is this, counsel for the other side said that there is a division of judicial authority on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.420" offset="15733008">That is true in one sense of the word, but in at least two respects, I think, there has been no division of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.827" offset="15762683">And one of the two respects is this, so far as I am, at least in every case that's cited in the briefs here and I presume they've probably represented every reported opinion, whatever this issue has been raised before any judge, he has always gone to great length to see if there is any indication of actual real prejudice to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.190" offset="15856097">Now, that was done here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.411" offset="15864978">The District Judge, Justice Aldrich pointed out the facts that I'm pointing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.309" offset="15884622">Here is a defendant, fully confident, counsel of his own choice, competent counsel, counsel spoke on the question of sentencing, defendant was there all the time, conferred with his counsel, no indication the defendant wanted to speak, no indication what defendant would have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.051" offset="15951600">The Court of Appeals, in affirming here, took exactly the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.295" offset="15968528">And as far as I know, in every case cited in our brief, every judge who's passed on this point has felt no matter what was the literal meaning or impact of Rule 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.233" offset="16020355">That in order to be sensitive, to be certain that no defendant had really been hurt or harmed, he must look into the factual picture and see whether there was any actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.528" offset="16073435">I think that's a fair statement of every judge who, as I say, who has written an opinion that's been reported on this point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="3999.658" stopTime="4069.045">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="3999.658" offset="16101961">I notice that in neither the petitioner's brief nor your brief, in a reference to a case that seems to me irrelevant in consider of your researches, I must conclude that it isn't relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.049" offset="16151594">And that's Bruno against the United States, involving another protected doctrine of criminal law, namely the right to have a jury charged with the failure to take the witness stand is not to be counted against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.768" offset="16218467">And the argument there was made and that's a -- the jury don't take any stock in it and was taking care of, generally, the courtroom that it must be specifically such a -- such a charge and certainly, if requested, must be specifically given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.575" offset="16289625">And it's not in the realm of argument that it didn't hurt (Inaudible) be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.850" offset="16310732">How would I say, declared to me that this is not unlike the problem of this case, namely the extent to which you -- you withdraw from argument in a particular case a protected rule to exert in its argument and had a great deal to be set forth.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="4069.045" offset="16379591">Well, I agree with you that its argument did whether or not it still does today, perhaps, is debatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.010" offset="16403414">But that, I think, brings me to another point, which is already been touched on here and which I think, perhaps, is a point that has also troubled every court or judge who has been called upon to handle this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.328" offset="16460675">And that is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.384" offset="16464959">It's quite true, as defendant's very able counsel has pointed out, that looking at this thing prospectively, one can say, "Well, this is no great burden on a trial judge."</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.805" offset="16514591">It takes only -- made -- most cases going to take a minute of his time because frequently the defendant won't say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.926" offset="16535071">If the defendant does reply why, that's all to the Government, so what possible harm is there in imposing an absolute rule and saying it is mandatory and you either do it or else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.318" offset="16588675">Now, that is the position taken by the Court of Appeals here prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.514" offset="16613439">When you do it prospectively, it is quite true there will be no serious interference with the orderly processes of the criminal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.953" offset="16651160">But when you do what the petitioner seeks here, when you attempt to make this interpretation of what apparently is an ambiguous rule, judging by the remarks of Mr. Justice Whittaker and by what Judge Ford did here, when you make such an interpretation of an admittedly ambiguous rule mandatory retrospectively, then it seems to the Government, and this is what troubles the Government very much, that you really get into very serious difficulties in the administration of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.344" offset="16804760">You do so, I think, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.573" offset="16817716">In the first place, supposed this Court remands the case as petitioner seeks for resentence, that will mean that a district judge, presumably Judge Ford, over eight years after the original conviction will be called upon to resentence this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.184" offset="16904129">That, I should judge, would not be altogether an easy thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.177" offset="16924087">And then there is the second thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.169" offset="16935999">If relief has given this petitioner here, you're not simply doing what most courts have done, leaving the door open for a showing that when there's been any -- any actual prejudice, when anybody's been actually hurt, relief will be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.576" offset="17001723">But quite literally it seems to me, you're taking the door off its hinges and throwing it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.218" offset="17024293">By that I mean, as the Court has already brought out, every single prisoner, who is still serving his sentence under the theory advanced by petitioner, would be entitled then to raise this point and to obtain a remand for resentencing no matter how long ago he may have been convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="5644.005" offset="22679385">Well, if the Court please, I should like now to speak briefly as the petitioner's counsel about the issues raised in No. 179.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.407" offset="22720972">The first issue there, as petitioner's counsel had pointed out, is whether or not, because of the fact and the Government concedes as petitioner's counsel says that there was actually, after the jury's verdict of conviction on all three counts, only one offense here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.857" offset="22810833">Whatever language you use, whether Counts 1 and 2 were varies under Count 3 or whatever you want to call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.869" offset="22834866">There's no argument about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.434" offset="22841135">That was recognized by the district judge below and by the Court of Appeals also.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.528" offset="22865481">But where the difficulty comes is in this problem of sentence because the argument that petitioner has made, as we understand it, is simply this, petitioner says, "When the judge went to sentence," as was natural, "he imposed 20 years, Count 1, 20 years, Count 2, 25 years, Count 3, all to run concurrently."</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.577" offset="22965687">And because he happened to impose first, a 20-year sentence under Count 1 and then another one under Count 2, he had, so to speak, exhausted his power of sentencing because there is only one offense here and therefore, the 25-year sentence, which was the one he pronounced last, was null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.244" offset="23056384">Well, of course, we are dealing here you understand not with consecutive sentences but with concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.251" offset="23084387">One point I wish stress is that I do not believe it's fair to say the trial judge here did not realize the actual situation in his charge to the jury, found on pages 9 and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.900" offset="23143006">He twice referred to the fact that Count 3 was not really a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.354" offset="23164740">It was merely an aggregated form of the other counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.197" offset="23180204">Also, in the -- in dealing with the motions made in arrest of judgement where this point was brought out, though not in the form that is quite brought out here, the trial judge again indicate that he realized the problem involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.059" offset="23243630">Unfortunately, he made a technical error and that he imposed three concurrent sentences when, properly speaking, he should have imposed only one sentence presumably one on the third count on which the jury had convicted, the aggravated to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.493" offset="23313324">Where we part company, however, with petitioner here is that we do not think this Court should adopt any such automatic rule as that when you have a situation such as this, it is the first sentence which the judge pronounced, so to speak, that stands and all the others are void.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.801" offset="23406529">As a matter of fact, so far as we know, although this question has been raised quite frequently, no court has ever reached that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.501" offset="23445400">And I think there are some reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.699" offset="23454177">For instance, take the O'Keefe case, which is cited at page 37 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.663" offset="23474030">The O'Keefe case involved a situation very similar to our.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.370" offset="23488867">There were two counts, the first count was for a simple bank robbery, the second count was for the aggravated offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.914" offset="23514990">Now, for some reasons, which doesn't appear in the Court's opinion, the trial judge after a verdict of conviction on both counts happened to pronounce sentence first on Count 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.138" offset="23571937">He just happened to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.257" offset="23584371">The answer really, it seems to us, is the answer that the District Judge Wyzanski made when he was dealing with this point, it's found in -- in his opinion on page 2 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.117" offset="23627839">He said, "The true situation actually is that in one document, Judge Ford simultaneously imposed upon the defendant this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5892.870" offset="23674859">It's not accurate to say actually that he imposed them in -- in point of time at different problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.307" offset="23704639">It's a simultaneous thing."</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.070" offset="23715610">Now, again, we also do not relate that the series should be adopted which petitioner has suggested, namely that this Court should follow the idea in a situation such as this of affirming the lightest sentence only.</text>
            <text syncTime="5919.773" offset="23782484">Again, that argument was made below and the answer, I think, is contained in the sentence of the opinion of the Court of Appeals found in the record at page 28 stating that this -- this same argument have made repeatedly to Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.056" offset="23851551">And in every instance, the sentence in the count which carried with it the greater penalty was held valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.674" offset="23882062">And we cite on pages 37 in our brief the several of -- only a few actions of the many cases which have done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5953.653" offset="23918007">Now, this situation seems to us to differ very decidedly from the situation in the Yates case, which was referred to here by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.771" offset="23950503">In the Yates case, not only do you have 11 counts but more important than that, it was quite clear in the Yates case that the trial judge mistakenly but genuinely believe that each count was a separate distinct offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.512" offset="24017377">That is not true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.844" offset="24022706">The trial judge realized that Count 3 was just the aggravated form of the other counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.055" offset="24047574">Unfortunately, as I say, he was mistaken in the method he tried to handle it, namely by imposing three concurrent sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.365" offset="24084877">But I think it's fair from reading the remarks of the trial judge to conclude that what he meant to do, even though he did it inartistic, was to impose for the whole transact for the one offense which the jury had returned a verdict of conviction, the aggravated form of bank robbery, a sentence of 25-year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.791" offset="24178500">That's what he meant to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.869" offset="24186859">Now, he did it, I grant you, in an inartistic manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="6097.296" offset="24492596">On the other hand, most Court of -- most Boards of Parole, as my understanding, no one up above the legal situation, so that in the case such as this, they would realize, there was only one offense.</text>
