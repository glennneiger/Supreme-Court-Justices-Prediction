            <text syncTime="62.383" offset="352946">So you can see that all the fundamental issues in the case were properly raised by motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.615" offset="373844">At the close of plaintiff's case, the judge took those motions under advisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.365" offset="392861">The motions were renewed at the end of all of the testimony, and then they were brought up again after the verdict in the form of a motion for judgment, notwithstanding the verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.620" offset="473840">And when this got to the appellate court, the appellate court pointed out that the trial court had had ample opportunity to consider all these questions and they reversed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.478" offset="517308">And remanded the case for a new trial for doing what they said he should have done, which was to give a new trial limited to the last six allegations of negligence in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.099" offset="1279770">The factual context in which the appellate court held that this motion for -- that this motion should've been granted and that there wasn't a cause of action stated as to the right to give the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.760" offset="1338389">In the first place, these are the undisputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.812" offset="1350614">Now, these are the facts that were before the Court at the end of the plaintiff's case and this is what the appellate court was dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.942" offset="1375169">We had mystified by fire Smith, the trainman, who had reduced from 327 to slightly under 300 pounds, but he was still a pretty hefty customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.663" offset="1418010">He was in his early 60s and according to the testimony of one of the witnesses, his condition was such that he couldn't even step up from the ground and get on the lower step to get into the coach.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.154" offset="1460015">He had to get a stool or something and stand on that and then get into the coach.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.010" offset="1479450">Now, the trainman's chief job as everybody admits, is to protect the rail of the train in case of emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.228" offset="1508289">Fortunately, only too rarely, do we have a rear-end collision, but rear-end collisions or terrible vengeance.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.638" offset="1537964">And when there is some breakdown in the railroad mechanism and the rear of the train needs protection, that's what this man was on there for, to go back on sufficient distance to flag or put a fusee or put a torpedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.273" offset="1592508">Now, imagine having a man of those dimensions and those qualifications charged with that dreaded responsibility on a passenger train, loaded with people.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.825" offset="1634722">Now, there's not neither is there any question that it takes about a mile for passenger train to stop at such a -- in such a manner, as not to endanger the passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.698" offset="1678190">There's no dispute about that when he's making the maximum speed which on the Florida East Coast, is 79 miles an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.777" offset="1702431">Now, we can stop him sooner than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.845" offset="1710791">We stop one sooner than that a few weeks ago to avoid hitting a truck and we put 92 passengers in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.257" offset="1740361">Now, it's to provide for the safety of the passengers that the train has to be stopped in a reasonable manner and that takes a mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.545" offset="1769514">There's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.225" offset="1776306">Now, Smith himself testified that on prior occasions, he had gone back a mile or more to protect the train under circumstances where it was his duty to go back and protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.172" offset="1832103">On top of that, his counsel, my good friend, Bill Frates adverted to that fact in his argument before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.930" offset="1863137">And on top of that, the appellate court opinion, whatever else it may have wrong with it, is might good on this point, it also calls attention to the fact that he had to go back a mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.234" offset="1904306">Now, under those circumstances, with the man on the train almost entirely for the purpose of protecting of the railroad in the event of a mechanical failure or something happening which required the train to be protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.860" offset="2034813">We simply told Mr. Smith that because of your physical condition, he doesn't look to us like you're able to perform your duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.550" offset="2065533">And Smith said, "Well, I've just been up the hospital.</text>
