            <text syncTime="21.263" offset="188374">I'm concerned that at the close of yesterday's argument, I've left the impression that we conceive that there was filed an eleven-cent rate or that the Commission accepted an eleven-cent rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.655" offset="253994">We do not conceive either of those and that would be the second point of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.715" offset="274265">That argument will involve three considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.301" offset="288580">What could be done under the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="49.035" offset="299551">We will show that the Natural Gas Act and Order 174, which was promulgated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act, did not permit the filing of the rate in effect, but required the filing of the contract and the supplements are -- I mean that's there, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.411" offset="376978">It requires a consideration of what the petitioners did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.137" offset="395891">And we will examine their tender great schedule filings and show that those filings show on their face that they reflected the price situation exactly as it was, that is the contract price amended by the Kansas minimum-price order, of course, if, but only if, that order was valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.578" offset="757635">Pan American's main brief -- brief for petitioner Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.286" offset="780518">It's in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.286" offset="804551">And the definition of the rate schedule is contained on the next page, under Section 154.93, which -- at page 67.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.492" offset="865364">The third consideration, of course, will be what the Commission did and what -- in light of what the Commission could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.720" offset="906219">And in discussing the Commission's acts, we will make it perfectly clear that the Commission accepted the price situation as it was, that is, the contract price modified by the Kansas minimum-price order, if the order was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.809" offset="974660">But returning to what seems to us to be the critical issue in this case, which is whether or not the Superior Court of New Castle County has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.160" offset="1028054">That turns, in our view, upon the interpretation of Section 22 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.007" offset="1067447">Section 22 confers upon the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction in that limited class of cases, which, in the language of the statute, are, “Brought to enforce any liability or duty created by or to enjoin any violation of this chapter or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.”</text>
            <text syncTime="268.995" offset="1179355">Of course, the jurisdictional provision must be within the limits of federal court jurisdiction prescribed by Article 3 Section 2 of the Constitution, which defines the limits of federal court jurisdiction to cases arising under the Constitution and the laws of the United States and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.017" offset="1271411">In both the House Committee Report and the Senate Committee Report on the Natural Gas Act, the Committees described the intent and purpose of Section 22 in identical language using the traditional cases arising under language of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.562" offset="1349569">The language reads, “This Section imposes appropriate jurisdiction upon the courts of the United States over cases arising under the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="322.808" offset="1394604">This language is not only contained in the Constitution, but it is contained in the older jurisdictional statutes with which we're familiar, particularly 12 or 28 U.S.C., which deals with federal question jurisdiction and 28 U.S.C.1338, which deals with exclusive federal court jurisdiction in patent and copyright cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.156" offset="1504005">This language has been repeatedly construed by this Court, the lower federal courts and the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.548" offset="1537546">I don't believe that it's an overstatement to say that at least since the decision of this Court in Gully, all courts have, without exception, construed this language to mean that the single test of the trial court's jurisdiction is a statement of the plaintiff's claim in his complaint, unaided by any defenses which maybe raised by the defendant or even by any allegation which the plaintiff makes in anticipation of some defense, which the defendant may plead.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.819" offset="1686653">No matter how carefully it's disguised, the petitioners' position here with respect to jurisdiction must be to urge this Court to depart from this traditional test and adopt a new test, reconstruing the cases arising under language of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.857" offset="1770768">For they urge to adopt the rule under which the trial court's jurisdiction is determined from an examination of the subject matter of the action, irrespective of whether the filed rate comes into the case as a part of the plaintiff's claim or is merely injected into it as a matter of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.698" offset="1878183">The single excuse which is offered by petitioners for this radical departure is a claim that it would aid the uniform construction of their filed rate schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.304" offset="1940564">They rely upon cases which deal with the Labor Management Relations Act and the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.808" offset="1978598">These labor relations cases, it seemed to us, make it perfectly clear that neither the Congress nor this Court has ever regarded exclusive federal court jurisdiction as an aid or a device to promote uniformity, in Garner versus Teamsters, Chauffeurs and Helpers, which we discussed at page 34 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.738" offset="2074311">This Court pointed out that when the objective is uniformity of decision, the very same considerations which would oust state courts of jurisdiction, oust federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.454" offset="2145155">And again, a year later in Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America versus Richman Brothers, another labor relations case, which we discussed at page 34 of our brief, this Court reviewed the history of our dual system of state and federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.986" offset="2223313">And there, it was pointed out that the courts -- that the state courts have always been regarded as perfectly adequate tribunals for the resolution of federal questions which are injected in the cases as a matter of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.768" offset="2298441">Even in those instances in which the conflict is between regulatory agency jurisdiction on the one hand and court jurisdiction on the other, either state or federal, this Court pointed out that uniformity of decision is provided for by the review in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.362" offset="2376808">That's the doctrine announced in Great Northern Railway Company versus Merchants Elevator Company, which we discussed at page 35 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.404" offset="3040946">In the final analysis, it seems to us that petitioners' argument is not so much that the state court has no jurisdiction as it is that plaintiff's common-law claims which have been asserted in the state court are without merits on account of the intervention of the Natural Gas Act in the filed rate schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.285" offset="3144495">I mentioned yesterday that our cases were patterned after the decisions of the Fifth Circuit Court in Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America versus Harrington and the District Court's opinion which preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.404" offset="3213040">That case was on all force with the case at bar, it involved the Oklahoma order, which this Court held to be invalid in 1956 and therefore, preceded our cases by some two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.999" offset="3283362">I call the Court's attention particularly to the opinion of the Fifth Circuit, for there, it seems to us that they deal with the precise contention which is made here by the petitioners and that is that these common-law rights did not survive the Natural Gas Act, the Phillips' decision and Order 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.235" offset="3380328">And there, the Fifth Circuit, relying upon this Court's decision in Mobil, held squarely that the presence of regulation of producers' process by the Natural Gas Act did not defeat the pipeline company's common-law rights and common-law causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.257" offset="3488371">It seems to us that the doctrines laid down in Mobil and in Memphis in which this Court held about the Natural Gas Act, did not abrogate contract rights, stands squarely for the proposition that these claims are meritorious, if they can be established upon their facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.329" offset="3584711">I also call the Court's attention to the Sunray Mid-Continent case, Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Company versus FPC and Texas Gas Transmission Corporation versus Shell Oil Company, both of which are discussed at page 13 of the amicus brief of Colorado Interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.445" offset="3673109">I think that those will be helpful in pointing up these -- this Court's view as to the interrelation between common-law and contract rights and rights which arise out of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.366" offset="3740818">I have mentioned these cses particularly because its petitioners' suggestion that Cities' common-law claims are fictitious claims and therefore, they seek to apply the rule of this Court in the Lambert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.960" offset="3811244">The Court will perhaps recall that in Lambert, a shipper sued a railroad to enjoin the operation of certain shipping rules as I recall 8, 9 and 10 and making the allegation that those rules were the rules of the railroad and conflicted with Rule 12 of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.752" offset="3922422">Now, the fact was that Rules 8, 9 and 10 were not the railroad company's rules at all, but were the rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.876" offset="3962859">And this Court held that by simply alleging that those were the railroad company's rules, it could not oust the federal courts of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.774" offset="4014477">The significant point is that the Section 22 of the Natural Gas Act has no application to these cases because these cases were not brought to enforce liabilities created by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.631" offset="4085948">That the State Court of Delaware has jurisdiction over these cases because they were brought to enforce liabilities over which the state court has jurisdiction, contract liabilities arising out of state law and common-law -- and common-law doctrines of restitution and unjust enrichment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.634" offset="4325857">Turning now to our second point, we will answer petitioners' claim that their filed rate defense is -- will be a meritorious defense when these cases are tried below, on their merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.670" offset="4398059">As I pointed out, we do not view this as being an issue before this Court, but we do think that it is appropriate, since this seems to us, to be the whole point of petitioners' argument to discuss the matter and to show that petitioners' filed rate was the contract rate modified by the Kansas minimum-price order if that order was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.031" offset="4527522">We rely principally upon the two decisions of the Circuit Courts who have examined rate schedule such as these in which there was filed the basic gas purchase contract and the copy of the Kansas minimum-price order or -- those cases are Cities Service Gas Company versus FPC, to which we referred as Magnolia, since Magnolia Petroleum Corporation was the intervenor and it was its rate schedule, as cited and discussed at page 36 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.828" offset="4666702">And the Third Circuit's opinion in Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America versus FPC, Dorchester Corporation, intervenor, which we describe as the -- referred to as the Dorchester case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.945" offset="4735143">In each of those cases, the Circuit Courts held that in view of the decisions of this Court, holding that the Oklahoma price order in the Dorchester case was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.930" offset="4791045">And the Kansas price order in the Magnolia Case was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.726" offset="4810271">That in view of that decision, these rate schedules fixed the legally effective rate at the contract rate unmodified by the void order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.648" offset="4865964">It simply -- those courts simply held that the void order could not amend or modify a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.528" offset="4901491">Let us examine in detail, what could be done under the Natural Gas Act and Order 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.398" offset="4944959">As we understand the petitioners' position, they conceive that their initial rate filings initiated a rate-making or a rate-changing procedure, under which the Federal Power Commission set aside the contract and contractualobligations which ran between us and made new obligations for us without a hearing, without the parties being present and solely on the basis of an ex parte fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.700" offset="5102216">In the Mobil case, this Court reviewed it later the powers of the Federal Power Commission as defined in Sections 5 (a) and 4 (e) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.145" offset="5155924">This Court said that Section 5 (a) prescribed the basic power of the Federal Power Commission with respect to rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.315" offset="5192600">Giving it the power to conduct hearings and make determination after hearings with respect to a contract which had been filed with it and upon the finding that the rates fixed in the contract were unjust and unreasonable, then to remedy that, by setting aside and -- or modifying those contract rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.587" offset="5297716">This Court said, “This is neither a rate-making nor a rate-changing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.058" offset="5327600">It is simply the power to review the rates and contracts made in the first instance by natural gas companies and if they are to be -- determined to be unlawful, to remedy them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.951" offset="5383189">The Commission's Order 174, under which these filings were made, were limited to procedural matters only and were not intended to affect substantive rights after hearings and after two amendments to the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.745" offset="5454346">The Commission entered its Order 174-B and with it, it filed an opinion in which it expressed this view of what it was doing in Order 174.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.017" offset="5507427">It said, and I quote, “Substantive rules, however, do not appear desirable in connection with the filings with which these rules are concerned, and it is the intention of the Commission to relate these rules strictly to procedural matters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.706" offset="5582242">Order 174 did not permit the filing of the rate in effect on June 7, 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.101" offset="8335757">However, there is now in existence the Kansas minimum price-order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.795" offset="8462503">If I may move on, I think also that an examination of these tabulation in which the eleven-cent price, which was called to your attention by Mr. Gray yesterday, is footnoted "Kansas minimum-price order" and this tabulation is at page 638, shows clearly that at all times everyone recognized that the sole claim to the eleven-cent price was the Kansas minimum-price order and therefore was wholly dependent upon its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.560" offset="8601579">If what we are looking for is something definitive which the Commission did, which indicated its view, seems to me, that the only definitive thing which they ever did was to cover the matter in Cities' rate settlement order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.352" offset="8668766">Immediately after the decision or the promulgation of the Kansas order in May 1954, Cities sought an increase in its own rates, before the Federal Power Commission relying largely upon the increase cost to it of purchase gas, occasioned by the minimum price order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.486" offset="8765315">In that order, in settling that case, the Commission granted as to increased rates based upon with the increased cost, occasioned by the Kansas price order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.914" offset="8807006">But they made the requirement that if the Kansas order was determined to be invalid and if Cities received refunds on account of litigation such as this, then those refund should be passed back to our customers in the proportions in which they had borne the increased cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.233" offset="8888299">Sure, if, when petitioners filed these rates cases, their rates became fixed at the eleven-cent price, there would've been no occasion for the Commission to have made a provision for refunds, when and if the price order was held to be invalid and we received those refunds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.383" offset="9472920">And after Cities had filed their complaint, after they had filed their complaint, they then and before anyone had answered, filed a motion for summary judgment and attached thereto affidavits and certain certified copies of various documents including the entire rate filing made before the Federal Power Commission and that was before anyone had answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.624" offset="9653896">And then they moved, as I say, for a summary judgment on the basis of the rate filings made by Pan American before the Federal Power Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2419.712" offset="9782209">And now, they say it wasn't an eleven-cent rate, although they paid it for three years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2765.282" offset="11164505">It became apparent that a major issue in this case is the determination on what rates was the filed rate and then it came on over and it said as follows, “The question then becomes what rate was legally filed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.193" offset="11236185">Now, that's the issue the trial court said it was deciding and that's the issue I say they couldn't have decided and then it gets to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court says, “Being void because a Kansas order was void, they're going back in doing what you'd have to do under Section 19, the review statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.979" offset="11319254">Being void, the unilateral filing of the order as part of the rate scheduled for the nullities."</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.999" offset="11343391">And that was what was done in Dorchester and in both of the cases that -- in Mobil, they followed Section 19, but now, I want to move to Gully and here's what the doctrine of Gully is if I understand it correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.937" offset="11427088">“A suit to enforce a right which takes its origin in the laws of the United States is not necessarily or for that reason alone, one arising under those laws for a suit does not so arise, unless it really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction or effect of such a law upon the determination of which the result depends.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.867" offset="11534817">And I say now that once a rate becomes the legally filed rate with a federal agency, it becomes a part of the body of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.612" offset="11581837">And this Court has said that time and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.738" offset="11598346">For example, in Crancer versus Lowden, 315 U.S., I think, this may not be in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.717" offset="11642232">That -- this Court said, “Until changed, tariffs bind both carriers and shippers with the force of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.969" offset="11675251">Now, it seems to me that when the Court says that it must decide what was the filed rate that that's the issue in the trial court and when the Supreme Court supports them in that, it seems to me that certainly, they've met the test of the Gully case, that they are construing and that the determination of the case depends upon the interpretation of federal law.</text>
