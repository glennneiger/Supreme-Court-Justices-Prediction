            <text syncTime="20.879" offset="186911">This case is on -- here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which denied enforcement of a National Labor Relations Board order requiring the respondent, Mattison Machine Works to bargain with the United Auto Workers on the ground that the underlying representation election was effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.172" offset="296103">The issue here is whether the Court of Appeals exceeded its reviewing power under Section 10 of the National Labor Relations Act in concluding that some of the employees may have been dissuaded from voting in the election because the election notices and the ballots described the employer as Mattison Machine Manufacturing Company instead of Mattison Machine Works or the Board had found that there was no evidence in the record or indeed a contention that this error in nomenclature confused either the employer or the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.635" offset="541863">That is correct, Your Honor, Manufacturing Company instead of Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.038" offset="563493">Mattison Machine was the same in both (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="121.846" offset="590764">The effects are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.822" offset="602676">Respondent is a machine tool manufacturing company in Rockwood, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.457" offset="629217">In 1957, the auto workers filed a petition under Section 9 (c) of the National Labor Relations Act with the Board's Regional Director in Chicago requesting an election to determine whether respondent's production and maintenance employees desire the union as their representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.614" offset="717824">The petition, although giving the correct address of the employer, described it as Mattison Machine Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.609" offset="757844">The petition went to hearing before a hearing officer but the only issue was raised by the respondent or whether the union was in compliance with the Acts' filing requirements, Sections 9 (f), (k) and (h) whether the petition was in fact back by its 30% of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.440" offset="845093">Respondent made no contention that there was any error in the name of the company and made no motion to correct the name set forth on the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.949" offset="903189">Based on this hearing, the Board thereafter directed that an election be conducted on the union's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.258" offset="936417">The election was held in respondent's plant pursuant to customary Board procedure and there is no contention that that was not followed here, notices of the election were posted for at least three working days before the election that each location of the plant where notices to employees were customarily posted, describing the voting unit, the date of the election and where in the plant and the hours at where -- at which the election would be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.080" offset="1091688">However, the notices and the ballots that were subsequently used, continued to describe the employer as Manufacturing Company instead of Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.630" offset="1141844">But in each case, Mattison Machine was spelled out both in the notices and on the ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.495" offset="1185311">In the election, 317 out of 342 eligible voters or about 92% of the potential electorate voters, 157 votes were cast for the union, 141 votes against, 1 ballot was void and 18 were challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.678" offset="1298056">Challenged ballots being defirmitive of the election results original director undertook to investigate the challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.091" offset="1347688">The respondent filed with the Regional Director, objections to the conduct of the election and objections to the regions' investigation of the challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.112" offset="1407770">In essence, the contention was that one field examiner had not adequately investigated the 18 challenges and that another one had improperly denied two employees the right to vote in the ground that they were supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.227" offset="1484257">Two weeks later, respondent sent the Regional Director a letter stating, and this is quoted at page 19 of the record, another error in this case that you should know about is the fact that your specimen ballot and notice of election and the tally ballot, they were furnished, all speak of the company as the Mattison Machine Manufacturing Company instead of the Mattison Machine Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.710" offset="1638170">The Regional Director investigated the objections and issued a report on objections and challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.567" offset="1677667">He found no merit to the objections respecting the misnomer in name.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.667" offset="1706088">He found that it was a -- such a limited extent that it could not have tended to confuse the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.778" offset="1742451">Respecting the challenges, he recommended that 8 would be sustained and the remaining 10 be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.755" offset="1774425">And since the remaining challenges were not enough to now affect the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.405" offset="1800965">He recommended that the union be certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.835" offset="1822699">Respondent filed exceptions to the Regional Director's report with the Board -- respecting the misnomer on the notices and on the ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.890" offset="1914964">There was no contention that the employees were misled thereby or nor was any effort made to show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.868" offset="1954879">Respondents' position was simply that since the ballots or the documents by which the employees authorized the union to represent them, a technical defect in the ballots ipso facto rendered the authorization legally in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.256" offset="2040351">The respondent added that it -- it brought the defect to the attention of a field examiner of the Board in the preliminary conferences that had been held prior to the election but the field examiner had done nothing about changing the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.149" offset="2116002">It was a -- I reiterate, no contention, nor no effort to prove that the defect in name had any effect on the -- in terms of confusing the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.769" offset="2178487">The contention was simply that since there was this defect, the vote couldn't validly authorize the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.499" offset="2217357">In effect, the argument similar to the argument that if somebody undertakes to convey Black Acre by deed if he describes the property as a White Acre, the deed is ineffective to affect the conveyance, that was the nature of the contention that respondent raised with respect to the variance in -- in name.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.777" offset="2330520">The Board found that respondents' exceptions were without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.214" offset="2364270">With respect to the misnomer, the Board held that in view of the slight nature of the discrepancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.945" offset="2403140">A fact that the election was held in the plant and that 317 out of 342 of the employees had voted, it could not reasonably be said that the employees could have been misled by this slight variance.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.130" offset="2515884">Yes, Your Honor, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.538" offset="2545560">The Board further noted that there was no evidence in the record that any employees were misled by the variance nor did the employer so contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.083" offset="2595715">The Board then went on to sustain the Regional Director's rulings with respect to six of the challenged ballots, he had sustained the challenges to eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.244" offset="2652348">The Board found that it was only necessary to sustain six because even assuming that the remaining 12 challenges and the votes of the two employees who are allegedly denied an opportunity to vote on the ground that they were supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.508" offset="2733432">Even if he accounted all of those against the union, the union would still have a majority, the final tally being 157 for the union and a 155 against the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.230" offset="2792260">So the Board certified the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.377" offset="2808874">Respondent petitioned for a reconsideration of the Board's decision and did not even mention the ruling on the misnomer as one of the grounds for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.367" offset="2856835">It limited it -- its contention to the fact that these two alleged supervisory employees, were improperly denied the right to cast a ballot and that the six challenges should not have been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.449" offset="2961220">Thereafter, the -- the Board found that the petition had not -- reconsideration, didn't present anything that hadn't been considered previously and denied it and certified the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.235" offset="3020361">The respondent refused the bargain with the union asserting the invalidity of the underlying representation election, unfair labor practice charges were filed by the union and the Board issued an order requiring the company that they -- to bargain with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.757" offset="3094444">The Board then undertook to obtain enforcement of that order in the court below and under 9 (d) of the Act, that brought up for review the validity of the underlying representation procedure because that was the sole basis for the refusal of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.575" offset="3177723">Now, in the Court of Appeals, respondent asserted that the four erred in certifying the union as the bargaining representative without first taking evidence on whether the misnomer kept some employees from voting and on the question of whether these two employees alleged to be supervisors were denied an opportunity to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.171" offset="3324008">If they were supervisors, of course they would not have been in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.244" offset="3344384">Now, this was the first time in this proceeding that the respondent equated the misnomer with confusion of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.957" offset="3399241">Up to now, it had merely been asserting that a technical variance was -- was enough irrespective that it may not have had any effect on the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.213" offset="3448247">The Court remanded the case to the Board to hold a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.860" offset="3470817">It conceded that the respondent had made no showing that the misnomer had caused confusion and that it may well be that no confusion in fact resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.336" offset="3540720">And I'm now reading from the Court's opinion at record page 92, "But in view of the closeness of the election and the confusion as to whether two employees were deprived of an opportunity to vote, was incumbent upon the Board to determine whether or not any of the 25 employees who did not vote might have failed to do so because of the irregularity in the notices of election.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="894.386" offset="3680946">The Proposition of the law seems to be that if you got a close election, you've got an error no matter what character -- error and is called in to the attention of the Board and the Board has to negatively -- possibility of some prejudice having been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.431" offset="3761089">Is that the proposition involved?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="915.340" stopTime="1501.906">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="915.340" offset="3764746">That seems to be the proposition, Your Honor and it does not stand alone in this case because the Seventh Circuit has reiterated this proposition in two other cases besides this case, one of which is pending on a petition for certiorari, Number 382, the Celanese case.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.733" offset="3850324">Now, we believe that -- that proposition is -- is contrary to settled principles enunciated by this Court and followed by the other Courts of Appeals, namely that Section 9 of the Act vest the Board with discretion to determine when an election reflects the fair and free choice of the employees and the role of the reviewing Court is to step in only if the Board is arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.860" offset="4022836">There is no reasonable basis to the Board's conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.608" offset="4045824">Furthermore, a corollary to that principle is that the burden is not on the Board but on the party challenging the fairness of the election to reduce evidence in support of his contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.189" offset="4112175">Now, the reasons for these principles are two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.161" offset="4135999">In the thousands of elections which the Board conducts each year and it conducted over 6000 fiscal year ending 1960 it is acquired to some degree of expertise in spotting what kinds of irregularities are aft to affect employee free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.555" offset="4233592">I think if the Board can late claim to expertise in any field that is in this election field here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.086" offset="4275702">To require the Board to investigate every unsupported charge of election irregularity, would tend the Board down the election machinery in an endless delay, thereby nullifying the statutes' basic aim which is at -- get a prompt determination of the employees desires concerning a representative in the hope that this will be the best way of avoiding industrial strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.361" offset="4412792">Now, in the circumstances here, we submit that the Board was -- was clearly reasonable in concluding that the slight misnomer in -- in company name was not likely to have deterred any employees voting, nor that the respondent here introduced any contrary evidence before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.937" offset="4519163">Indeed as I pointed out, it did not even contend before the Board that this defect had any effect so far as confusing the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.161" offset="4576005">The confusion contention was first advanced in its brief in the Court of Appeals and the statement there set forth which is also repeated at page 10 of its brief in this Court for the effect that when the election notices were posted, it scared many employees who arranged their vacations to include the day of the election as no record support whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.679" offset="4706095">There's not anything in the record that would substantiate that speculation which respondent indulged in first in its brief in the court below and repeated in its brief to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.915" offset="4775058">Finally, we submit that the alleged confusion over the two employees who did not vote mentioned by the Court of Appeals in its opinion, had nothing to do with the misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.974" offset="4839320">The confusion with respect to them was simply whether or not when they came up to get a ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.988" offset="4883310">The field examiner, the Board filed examiner told them that since they had been struck from the eligibility list by the employer that they could cast a ballot but it would be challenged or whether as alleged by the employer, they were merely told that they couldn't vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.143" offset="5003995">Now, the Board did not resolve that conflict in testimony because it found it unnecessary to do so in view of the fact that even had they voted and had they voted against the union, the union still would have had a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.757" offset="5066376">There is no showing, no indication, no contention that this colloquy between the observers and the -- and the two alleged supervisors was noticed by any of the employees, had any effect, any confusion on the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.892" offset="5150908">It is merely a confusion with respect to an evidentiary conflict that had nothing to do with the misnomer but so -- so therefore, we submit that the -- that the Court clearly erred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.576" offset="5237635">As I -- as I indicated before however, we are not solely concerned about this case, we're concerned about the fact that it is or appears to be part of a pattern here in the Seventh Circuit, the Celanese case which is pending on -- on cert, involve a little different factual pattern but essentially the same erroneous standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.889" offset="5394892">There, the Board and I don't want to burden the Court too much with the facts of Celanese, set aside an election because it found that -- that there had been a -- a misstatement on the union's part in the closing moments of the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.057" offset="5487574">The union -- the company had alleged that -- the union had asserted that all of the fringed benefits enjoyed by the employees with a result of collective bargaining when in fact it turned out that one or two had not been the result of collective bargaining but had given voluntarily by the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.506" offset="5653400">The court below, following the principle that it had enunciated in the earlier (Inaudible) case, took the position that since there was a misstatement of fact in the closing moments of the campaign, that was enough to set the election aside that Board elections had to -- had to be pure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.622" offset="8249866">I had previously, on July the 7th -- on July the 8th, that a conference that was called by the Regional Director for the purpose of setting up this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.867" offset="8290826">I had called to the field examiner Jewel Morrow's (ph) attention that the name of the company was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.686" offset="8318098">In answer to her first question, "What is the corporate name of the company?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.889" offset="8330951">I told her, Mattison Machine Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.489" offset="8341295">She looked up at me entirely and she says, "I think, I have better follow the union's petition."</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.139" offset="8363969">So she used manufacturing the Mattison Machine Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.215" offset="8384240">Now, they have added in appendix to their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.474" offset="8405243">And on page 23, it's definitely her responsibility and I quote -- let's start talking about notice of election on page 23 in appendix to the petition of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.498" offset="8473370">"But the basis for such elect -- action is the election order sheet prepared by the assigned Board agent and the responsibility for the accuracy of the finished notice of election is his."</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.809" offset="8518614">In this case, hers, but she refused to change the name of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.761" offset="8542438">Well, that was on July of the 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.001" offset="8551424">On August the 28th, I had the conference and was denied for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.793" offset="8570546">I was also denied a new election contingent upon his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.275" offset="8600430">On November the 19th, the Regional Director got around to filing his report and I am now reading from page 20 of the transcript before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.553" offset="8661556">Referring to a reference to the -- to its communication of August 22nd, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.153" offset="8684022">The company states that it advised the Board agent of the proper corporate name during the conference at which the election details were discussed because in the company's opinion, the ballots have to carry the correct authorization that there was to be any contract negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.945" offset="8751104">The Board agent who conducted the pre-election conference has no recollection if there ever having been any discussion on such occasion concerning the proper corporate title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.950" offset="8795199">We submitted in this connection two affidavits of two people who were present at that conference as to what the conversation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.202" offset="8832188">They are in appendix to my brief for the respondent, affidavits one and two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.771" offset="8862490">From the foregoing, reading on the Regional Director's report, "It is evident that the extent of the corporate misnomer was the use of the words, "Manufacturing Company" instead of -- instead of "Manufacturing Machine Works," appearing on the notice of election, sample ballot, the ballots used in the course of the election and the tally of ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.581" offset="8953710">Now, as proof of the conversation between the Regional Director and myself, and he knowing fully well our contention, he goes on and says, "A misnomer of such limited extent cannot be said to have reasonably intended to create such confusion among employees involved as to have precluded a free and full expression in the casting of their ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.423" offset="9049109">So, it is in the record that we complained and the Regional Director put it in the record when he filed his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.592" offset="9129775">In the representation case, we asked for a hearing, we were denied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.843" offset="9154748">Or the respondent might file exceptions and objections to the Regional Director's report and in large on the misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.145" offset="9183901">I asked for a hearing on my exceptions and objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.548" offset="9197589">We were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.559" offset="9205635">On my petition for review of the Board's certification despite these two big errors, it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.555" offset="9233638">I asked for a rehearing or reconsideration and it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.272" offset="9256417">The Circuit Court of Appeal apparently concluded that the Board was coming before it with unclean hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.521" offset="9293406">They haven't certainly done equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.536" offset="9301556">They wouldn't even hear a word from the respondent from 155 people who are reported to have voted against the union on the contention that the misnomer did cause confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.164" offset="9348054">They closed the iron curtain which is that -- customarily referred to as administrative procedure because there is a certain amount of latitude allowed to a Regional Director and to a Board that they lowered the curtain, I couldn't even get a hearing, I couldn't put in any evidence but the record shows that the matter of confusion was discussed and the Regional Director brought it out himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.640" offset="9445961">He was referring to it in his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.964" offset="9459231">That brings me to the question -- of the question that they show in their brief which Justice Douglas has -- says it's identical and it appears in the writ of -- petition for writ of certiorari before it had found that there was no contention and no evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.261" offset="9540420">That is an illogical conclusion by the Board or Solicitor General who prepared the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.237" offset="9584306">The matter was of record because on July 8, I told the field examiner, "Change the name."</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.576" offset="9609697">And she said, "She'd better follow the petition of the union."</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.119" offset="9627878">On August the 28th, I asked for a hearing and among the things we discussed was the question that there was confusion caused by notices which are addressed to the employees of Mattison Machine Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.143" offset="9683989">That's what the notice of election granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.662" offset="9694020">The specimen ballot was addressed to the employees of the Mattison Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.055" offset="9719620">The confusion was caused and the Regional Director knew it full well so he discussed it in his November 17th or November 19th report and he calls it a misnomer of such limited extent that he could not possibly have caused confusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2969.029" offset="11979525">But the field examiner who was over zealous, he took up the place -- he took up the issue from thereon and he says, "You cannot vote."</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.372" offset="12084851">Now, he's talking to a group of people who are lined up waiting to go to a ballot box.And here is the government's agent, throwing his weight around it and these people aren't impressionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.790" offset="12130513">And two men who were actually our only workers and entitled to vote were not allowed their opportunity to pick their own bargaining agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.228" offset="12232286">And actually -- actually, there was never a decision in connection with the two workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.389" offset="12256946">Let me show you how the Board cites that -- that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.587" offset="12289755">There is on the back of my brief, six affidavits, and affidavits three, four, five and six have to do with the conversation that took place at the time these two illegible workers were denied the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.263" offset="12360391">Now, the Board and its certification comes along and they issue an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.378" offset="12388916">And I want you to realize what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.136" offset="12467911">However, we need not to cite this conflict in testimony about what the union watcher said and what the employer watcher said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.455" offset="12505213">For assuming arguendo that these two employees were denied an opportunity to vote, their votes would not have been sufficient in number to affect the results of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.555" offset="12553592">But the Regional Director, when I asked for a new election said, "I'll see what my investigation reveals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.023" offset="12579506">It was never decided."</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.637" offset="12589955">He never concluded or made a finding that they were eligible or not eligible but look at the demoralizing effect of denying two eligible workers the privilege to vote and the Regional Director's field examiner taking up the cudgels for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.656" offset="12654007">If you vote, it won't do you any good anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.861" offset="12666859">And my affidavit is the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.201" offset="12676159">That's what the conversation was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.546" offset="12689533">Now, the big point about the two people not being allowed to vote, it's contrary to the findings and policies of the National Labor Relations Act, free choice of bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.722" offset="12738226">It's contrary to Section 7 of the Act, free choice of bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.843" offset="12758706">These two fellows have no choice in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.648" offset="12769991">And it is also contrary to the intention of Congress in adopting the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.637" offset="12793919">They wanted free, untrammeled, unbiased, unprejudiced elections in which the worker could come in and make his own selection of bargaining agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.366" offset="12836864">But if the field examiner says, "You can vote and you cannot vote."</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.485" offset="12853269">That's entire usurpation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.241" offset="12864345">I referred to their appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.394" offset="12872913">They have the Labor Board manual and I call your attention to page 21 where it's speaking about the -- their own exhibits, speaking about the field examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.747" offset="12914395">They said, "Normally, the Board agent should be present."</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.884" offset="12926934">This is at a free election check but he's also present at the election, “to assist in the resolution of disagreements”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.696" offset="12950131">I'm reading."</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.803" offset="12954624">He should make it clear that he has no authority to find an individual eligible or ineligible to vote."</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.099" offset="12987747">Now, they're complaining about the Circuit Court of Appeals over stepping its ground and raising some kind of a fictitious argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.625" offset="13013870">The Circuit Court of Appeals had a matter before in which confusion was alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.315" offset="13036648">And in my brief and oral argument, I enlarged upon it, so the Circuit Court of Appeals very appropriately said, "And if the Board thinks that there was no contention in the matter, look what the Court says."</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.954" offset="13083146">And I quote, page 91 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.603" offset="13093804">One of the respondents' contentions before the Board was that the election should be set aside because of the notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.695" offset="13122121">Affidavits filed by respondent established that this discrepancy and irregularity was brought to the attention to the Board's representative that a conference held for the purpose of arranging details for the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.028" offset="13167470">The Board's investigation disclosed merely that its representative did not recall respondent having objective to the irregularity in the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.322" offset="13204668">And it goes on and drops down about half a page.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.296" offset="13216580">But the Board and the Regional Director, in disclosing of the respondent's objection, merely assumed that no confusion or prejudice resulted and the Court draws its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.578" offset="13261720">But in view of the closeness of the election and the confusion as to whether two employees were actually deprived of the opportunity to vote, we are not satisfied that the Board's disposition of the objection was such that it is entitled to obtain enforcement of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.336" offset="13324727">The Board had shown no deference at all to the respondent or the employer in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.296" offset="13348551">They were denying everything by administrative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.357" offset="13360776">The question is should we, under these circumstances, give the stamp of approval to the Board's rejection when there is nothing in the record to support such a conclusion, whether the irregularity had any effect on the election was never ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.433" offset="13413125">We hold that the ends of justice require a new election.</text>
