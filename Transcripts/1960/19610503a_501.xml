            <text syncTime="100.330" offset="504665">Secondly, and we say additionally and standing alone, its practices of tying in equipment leases with patent licenses are illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.728" offset="562239">And we say also that it is engaged in a program of compulsory package licensing of patents which standing alone is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.640" offset="609886">And that it has violated the laws because of its dominant position and its position holding basic patent of requiring in its patent license agreements grant-back clauses of future inventions.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.992" offset="699329">No, I'm not, Your Honor, I think there were erroneous legal tests applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.987" offset="727333">I think I shall demonstrate or even from construing the agreements, you'll find for example with respect to the tie-in argument that ? that the agreement, the so called alternative agreement of theirs compelled a prospective licensee to go back to Ransburg, the respondent to get equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.118" offset="847809">The petitioner, Binks -- Binks Manufacturing Company commenced this action by filing a declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.446" offset="881142">It was there or it's been a -- and that was in 1946 -- in 1956, October.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.587" offset="901726">There was a counterclaim filed by a respondent, Ransburg, beyond alleging infringement of the Starkey method patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.492" offset="937357">Binks, the petitioner, denied infringement alleged invalidity and misuse of the patent and charged violations of the Sherman and Clayton Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.775" offset="990438">The -- later, when the Starkey apparatus patent issued in June of 1957, it was brought in to the lawsuit in May of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.443" offset="1041115">The District Court found in favor of the respondent Ransburg, on all issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.883" offset="1066924">And the Court of Appeals affirmed except with respect to the matter of allowing Ransburg attorney's fees and the matter of attorney's fees is not here before this Court, matter of Ransburg's attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.051" offset="1115617">Now, the respondent Ransburg is in the business of leasing equipment used in electrostatic spray coating or painting.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.502" offset="1149367">There are, and we shall be discussing, two different painting processes which the respondent leads us.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.891" offset="1174967">First, which is called the number one process and then later commencing in 1951, they began marketing their number two process.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.399" offset="1220942">The number two --- number one process which they commenced marketing in 19 -- approximately 1944, consists basically in employing an electrostatic field for depositing liquid particles delivered or sprayed into the field by a conventional air spray gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.182" offset="1328149">I think the number one process is before us in -- insofar as it's part of the buildup of this monopoly position of their -- the respondent, there's no -- it's before us in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.725" offset="1390320">We alleged that by the position they attained in marketing the number one process, they got ? they got a dominant position there and the impetus from that gave them the dominant position immediately upon marketing the airless process in 1951, Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.646" offset="1469942">The number two process, a rotating or centrifugal bell or disk is substituted for the air gun of the number one process.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.892" offset="1514977">The number two process commonly referred to as the airless process has no spray gun used in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.080" offset="1555728">Now, respondent's marketing program, since respondent began licensing its electrostatic spray coating process in 1944, it has combined a patent licensing and an equipment leasing arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.056" offset="1623646">The respondent never sells this equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.242" offset="1632319">It always leases it.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.135" offset="1639946">And it charges an initial fee ranging from $5000 to $40,000 depending upon the size and type of the installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.612" offset="1681847">And then in addition, either a minimum monthly fee or a percentage of the cost of the coating material which passes through the process whichever those monthly fees is higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.590" offset="1733778">As of the time of the filing of this case, the respondent is granted 733 electrostatic coating licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.618" offset="1761886">Now that includes airless and with air.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.401" offset="1772962">And there 463 still in enforced, it had granted some 337 airless licenses of which beginning of this suit, there 272 still enforced in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.334" offset="1968671">But we or I shall argue and I -- our brief doesn't -- I think we can demonstrate that the so-called alternative agreement which they've printed and stopped commencing in 1953, really gave no choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.105" offset="2435741">And there are, however, some -- over that period, some 45 different agreements used.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.922" offset="2463013">In this agreement, the respondent represents that it is the owner or otherwise has the right to grant licenses under inventions and let his patent pertaining to and covering methods and apparatus used in the number one or the number two process depending on which it's licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.824" offset="2546709">But it usually does not spec -- specify the patents or doesn't specifically identify the patents or any inventions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.695" offset="7514154">And the total amount of these fees for the period of 1951 to 1957 was over $8,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.174" offset="7548113">Ransburg said in his brief -- or said they admitted it had some $2,250,000 invested in at leased equipment, figured on a cost basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.476" offset="7693249">And acquiring those patents on a non-exclusive basis for the right to sublicense, which we say should -- well, excuse me, they are on exclusive basis, where the -- in their field were the right to sublicense, which was we contend for the purpose of monopolizing this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.935" offset="7771094">It didn't just take a non-exclusive license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.415" offset="7781021">In each instance, they got an exclusive license.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.520" offset="7893452">Now, specifically with respect to this time, I say it with -- in every instance under the number two airless system and every instance where they actually leased it, a respondent joined a patent license with an equipment lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.903" offset="7970983">The practice under the number one system prior thereto had been substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.736" offset="8026363">A few licenses that were without leases, one was in a settlement of a lawsuit, the others were with a few licensees who had previously taken their equipment for use in another system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.042" offset="8063561">Prior to 1953, then the only form -- the standard form had in it a paragraph on equipment leasing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.798" offset="8218520">But at the same time, they were outstanding, these brochures which we've referred in our brief and that are in the record, volume 2 at pages 854 and 862 was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.611" offset="8273795">The emphasis has placed upon the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.098" offset="8287796">The trade gets the idea if it does business with Ransburg, it must take its equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.951" offset="8327189">Now, in 1953 and the Ransburg makes a big point of this, it changed its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.039" offset="8363551">We called it in our brief an attempt to purge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.103" offset="8379747">At that time, guess what did it would do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.074" offset="8387688">Well, it wrote to the existing licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.606" offset="8401795">All of whom had license -- licenses with leases and said, "You can go to another -- this other form without equipment."</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.271" offset="8440456">The other form now was this form which I contend, didn't give them that free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.358" offset="8464802">Now, these licensees had no reason in -- in the world to do that because they'd already in effect, paid for the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.903" offset="8495000">They wouldn't have to return their equipment without a refund of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.977" offset="8519241">At that time, for the first time and since after 1953, respondent, Ransburg, prepared a pricing schedule which would give the necessary information to one of its salesmen to price out a license without equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.109" offset="8591757">And it did tally salespeople to advise perspective licensees that they had this alternative agreement.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_f_meroni" startTime="2858.407" stopTime="3236.801">
            <label>Mr. Charles F. Meroni</label>
            <text syncTime="2858.407" offset="11537011">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.133" offset="11539937">If the Court please, this phase of the argument pertains to part 5 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.197" offset="11568149">To be valid and enforceable, a patent must claim from a background free of thought or inequitable conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.434" offset="11597093">This Court has so held in the Keystone, Hazel-Atlas and the precision cases cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.299" offset="11632619">Here, the respondent procured the allowance of its patents on the basis of affidavits showing commercial success of the number two system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.892" offset="11686954">But the affidavits neglected to point out that the number two system did not embody what was alleged to be the heart of the Starkey invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.024" offset="11739512">We say it was those omissions in the affidavits that constituted the perpetration of a fraud on the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.641" offset="11785906">Though, I might say that in that regard, that the only finding that I've been able to locate pertaining to this, is finding 91 of the findings here and they were all proposed by the defendant for the most part and adopted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.646" offset="11869915">And that appears at page 1013.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.177" offset="11884126">In that finding, the Court held that there was no willful representations of the patent office or withheld from the patent office knowledge of a pertinent prior right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.864" offset="11966777">Well, that has nothing to do with this point, which has to do with the withholding or concealment of evidence as to what the true character of the number two system was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.227" offset="12012231">In the affidavits that were filed, the party Starkey or the respondent, failed to disclose what that system was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.226" offset="12064266">Now, it should be borne in mind that these applications particularly the method case, was pending over 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.302" offset="12092583">It was filed on September 29th, 1944 and it wasn't though issued until August 3rd, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.910" offset="12126960">During that period of time, there were repeated rejections both by the examining staff and by the Board of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.199" offset="12160188">In the course of their representations, the applicants who were Starkey and Ransburg said to the patent office, and I'm quoting from page 55 of my brief a short sentence, The heart of applicant's invention lies in the concept of employing a single electrostatic field which acts as the soul agent to atomize paint, disperse the particles formed by atomization and deposit those particles on the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.992" offset="12291323">That statement was repeated constantly and Dr. Miller also admitted, as pointed out on the same page of our brief, that the thing that was considered new when he recorded the Starkey idea was the concept of using electrostatic forces alone to atomize, disperse and deposit these materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.268" offset="12380453">In other words, they -- they believe it to be new, to use the field by itself, apart from anything else, as the atomizing and dispersing and coding medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.975" offset="12447222">Now, there's no question here, there's no dispute about the fact that none of the structures shown on the Starkey patents and incidentally, the drawings of the two patents are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.416" offset="12492988">One is an apparatus patent that was divided out arbitrarily from the method patent without any requirement of division by the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.779" offset="12530500">So that the history of the apparent case which is the method case also carries over to the apparatus case, it being a true division.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.524" offset="12573445">Now, there's no question that none of the structure shown in those patents were ever commercialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.460" offset="12601240">That's unequivocally admitted by the respondent and that with respect, I'd like to call your attention for volume 1, page 199, request for admission 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.991" offset="12655365">Does defendant admit that it never commercialized by sale or lease, any electrostatic sprayer apparatus of the structure shown in -- in anyone of the figures of either of its earlier process patent number or it's later apparatus patent number?</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.851" offset="12718791">And the answer was, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.256" offset="12744391">Now, for some eight years after the Starkey application was allowed or was filed, only one narrow claim was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.030" offset="12783470">In 19 -- in 1949, the pew patent expired, that was the patent that the respondent acquired from Western Electric Company and which covered the number one system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.648" offset="12833938">Also at that time, the respondent brought forth this number two system, making use of both a centriphical means and a field to affect atomization and spray.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.805" offset="12882631">Now, our position, Your Honor, as to that point and which we believe is very critical to this case is shown on page 349 to 351 of volume 1, beginning at the middle of the page at 552 and ending in the middle of page 351.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.577" offset="12985657">There it -- there, it is conclusively shown that the number two system did not depend on the field alone for atomization, dispersion and deposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.807" offset="14062634">The Ransburg Company started out as the soul proprietorship, manufacturing housewares such as bread boxes, canister sets, waste baskets and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.564" offset="14105579">And they spray painted these products with ordinary conventional spray guns made by the large manufacturers such as the Binks Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.470" offset="14137240">There was a great deal of waste paint that came from that process, because of the fact that the air blast carried the paint beyond the product and wasted it and had to be exhausted and much of it was not recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.161" offset="14179976">It was as a result of experiments started by Mr. Ransburg's sons back in 1937 that they developed this number one process, which was simply using a compressed air spray gun the same type, to atomize the paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.268" offset="14240475">But combining with it, an electrostatic field which imparted charges to the paint particles and attracted them to the articles of manufacture, thereby, tending to overcome the effect of the air blast and making a more efficient painting operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.052" offset="14303587">Now, that number one process which has been referred to here as the air type process is not before this Court, we submit for the reason that since 1950 as the trial court found, there have been at least six firms in competition with each other, marketing the air type systems.The Binks Company, representatives testified in this case that there was no obstacle to their marketing, the air type electrostatic systems, since they first became interested in it, but they elected not to do so until 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.374" offset="14436916">The issues before this Court are confined to the so-called airless systems or the number two system which briefly is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.061" offset="14475577">Instead of a compressed air spray gun to atomize the paint, it's atomized either by means of a stationary atomizing head or rotating disks or bells, which feed the paint at a control rate to a zone of atomization at the edge of the head where the power of the electrostatic field itself tears off this atomized particles of paint from the liquid film and disperses it in the form of the spray and deposits it upon the article of manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.279" offset="14612459">The field is maintained in that case directly between atomizing head and the articles of manufacture on the conveyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.651" offset="14641925">Now, it was on this improved process which in many cases results in almost 100% efficiency in the deposit of paint and therefore, saves a great deal in paint cost as well as labor cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.184" offset="14704097">It's on this process that these two patents were acquired by application of the Ransburg Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.885" offset="14734921">One, for the method of painting in that manner and the other with respect to the apparatus, the method patent as I think the Court has observed, was issued in 1954 and the apparatus patent came out in 1957, probably these proceedings were pending in the trial court and was brought in by supplemental pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.797" offset="14818513">Now, when the company brought out these processes for public use, it found as would anyone that had an idea to market, that in order to sell that idea to industry and to persuade manufacturers of consumer goods that this was a better way to paint their products, they have to supply the tools for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.390" offset="14928959">Many of the components of this specialized equipment were not available on the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.674" offset="14958111">That was true when the number one system was brought out in about 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.845" offset="14978800">It was also true when the number two system came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.885" offset="14990921">When the number one system came out, there was not a safe voltage supply or power pack.</text>

            <text syncTime="3729.806" offset="15022582">In other words, the ones that were available for that time for x-ray purposes and so forth put out too much current and were likely to cause a lethal shock or a fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.544" offset="15061556">The same thing was true with respect to the electrodes and the controls of the electrical equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.503" offset="15085380">Ransburg contacted such firms as General Electric Company, a number of others to attempt to interest them in making this special equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.208" offset="15120175">Ransburg's interest being in licensing the process, it was not interested in the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.668" offset="15142013">It had no success I'd suppose partially, because that was during the war period and these companies had bigger fish to fry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.159" offset="15172002">As a result, it had to design its own power pack, its own control, its own electrodes and produce them in order to get anyone to take this process or to consider it for their production lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.975" offset="15227277">The same thing was true when the number two process came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.730" offset="15238248">These special atomizing heads were not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.983" offset="15247339">They were absolutely new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.262" offset="15256430">The same thing was true with respect to the accurately controllable paint supply system and that was a very crucial aspect of this rather delicate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.865" offset="15298853">And the fact is that Ransburg did contact the other large manufacturers among whom were Binks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.776" offset="15334484">The Court asked whether there was any evidence of that supporting finding number 10 and if the Court will refer to volume 3 of the record page 240, Mr. Roche, the president of the Binks Company himself, testified that they sold the equipment in conjunction with the systems that Ransburg put out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.342" offset="15452766">And there is no question but what the spray guns, paint spray boots, air paint exhaust systems, air make up systems and so forth, were sold by companies like Binks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.843" offset="15502712">When the number two system was being marketed, Ransburg had problems with respect to the paint supply which had to be controlled very accurately and it discussed that with the Binks Company among other people, which appears from Volume 1 of the record, page 710 in the testimony of Mr. Rice where he said, they couldn't -- this is talking about the airless system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.672" offset="15622040">He said they couldn't use a standard circulating system or pressure regulators -- regulators that we had used in our line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.404" offset="15648998">They even requested us at one time, to make up a special regulator to operate at the low pressures, if they need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.727" offset="15678255">Those were the steps that the company took to obtain assistance in getting the equipment necessary to interest industry in this very valuable device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.952" offset="15719215">It ended up that Ransburg itself, although a small concern had to design this equipment with the help of a man who was well-versed in electrical science and had been on a faculty of Purdue University.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.318" offset="15800613">As it began the marketing systems and industry began to see the value, Ransburg made this equipment available along with its licenses on a leased basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.324" offset="15860694">Now, the -- the contact essentially was a written license to use the process as long as the process patent was the only one that Ransburg have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.995" offset="15899355">The contract also said, however, that the company owned inventions and patent applications that have to do with methods and apparatus for electrostatic painting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.553" offset="15949615">So that, whoever took one of the written licenses was licensed not only under the patents it had, but under the inventions and applications that were pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.496" offset="15993396">Now, the equipment which was made available to these manufactures was entirely at the option of the manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.099" offset="16027773">The trial court found as a fact and the evidence supports it amply that there never was any requirement on the part of Ransburg, there was never any forcing that anyone take equipment in any instance whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="4114.737" offset="16562343">And I believe the reason for it appears from the very fact that in a period of approximately five years, when the number two process was introduced to 1951 up until the time of the trial, there had only been a few entered licenses granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.602" offset="16629739">I think the simple explanation is that the equipment manufacturers were not interested in that kind of volume.</text>
