            <text syncTime="38.496" offset="257337">The underlying issue in this case is whether the State of Florida denied him due process of law when it tried, convicted and sentenced him while he was admittedly unrepresented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.936" offset="323166">At the outset, I would like to summarize the petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.722" offset="346258">First, it is our contention that under the decisions of this Court, due process requires the State to offer or furnish counsel to a prisoner in a noncapital case whenever there are special circumstances which show that without representation by counsel, the petitioner or the prisoner cannot have a fair and adequate defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.690" offset="466108">In turning to the special circumstances which we contend exists in the present record, we say that there are six.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.854" offset="502784">They are these, first, ignorance, second, mental illness, third, complicated substantive issues involved in the trial, fourth, difficult evidentiary problems, fifth, the use of inadmissible testimony, entirely prejudicial testimony to convict and sixth, the fact that the unrepresented petitioner received no aid from the trial judge in guiding him pass the errors which make trial without counsel unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.336" offset="640711">The issue comes to this Court in the following manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.142" offset="655966">In 1959, the petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.819" offset="694627">He contended in this petition that he was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.091" offset="739767">In support of his contention, he alleged the following, that he was tried in the Criminal Court of Record in Polk County, Florida on an indictment charging him with "Assault to Murder in the First Degree".</text>
            <text syncTime="176.431" offset="809148">He alleged that he was a 29-year-old Negro, that he had never been in court before, that he did not understand court procedure and that he did not know how to defend himself and establish his innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.892" offset="870902">He further allege in his petition before the Florida Supreme Court that he requested the Court to appoint him a lawyer and that in response to that request, the Court told him, "You are not entitled to a lawyer as this is not a capital case and further, you won't need a lawyer in this case."</text>
            <text syncTime="213.667" offset="958046">The petition also alleges that a request was made for a copy of the information and the Court denied the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.764" offset="994408">It goes on to allege that the State picked the jury in the case, that the information was read and that the trial had commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.807" offset="1030562">When the trial was over, petitioner was convicted of "Assault to Murder in the Second Degree" and a 20-year-sentence was imposed upon him.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.299" offset="1248528">The three witnesses who followed were law enforcement officials, two policemen and a sheriff.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.454" offset="1373184">The answer to that, Your Honor, is that it contains a partial transcript of the trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.622" offset="1401814">The State filed a return in the Florida Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.142" offset="1443924">I use the word "denied" loosely because it said, "We deny that the petitioner was denied his constitutional rights by the alleged refusal to furnish counsel," and then went on to argue that it was noncapital, that he did a very fine job of representing himself and that the trial judge protected it.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.057" offset="2391646">The testimony of the petitioner is that he doesn't remember any of the events that took place from the time that he had an argument in this juke joint with the prosecuting witness until he is found barricaded, so to speak, in a building with a shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.455" offset="2465207">He does not know what happened.He testified that his mind is a complete blank.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.624" offset="2553919">The case is one that's susceptible of several interpretations and some very real and substantial issues for the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.809" offset="2814621">No one was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.772" offset="2822457">The gist of the State's case was that the petitioner took a blast with a shotgun at 14 feet at the prosecuting witness and missed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.460" offset="2861223">His testimony for that was that wasn't probable or possible, that he was an expert marksman in the Army and that if he'd meant to kill anybody at 14 feet with a shotgun, he could not possibly have missed.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.041" offset="2919528">The second type of defense goes to the amount of the sentence imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.755" offset="2942412">When we talk of the substantive issues at the trial, we will find that there's a 20-year sentence as the maximum in Florida for any type of assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.135" offset="2979924">And that that takes a felonious intent to kill coupled with the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.366" offset="3004792">Absent that intent to kill, the maximum sentence is five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.622" offset="3021824">So there is a 15-year difference in punishment and petitioner, without any credit for good time, would be about ready for release if he could've established the proposition of no intent to kill.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.875" offset="10062869">It's now my honor and privilege to extend to this Honorable Court the greetings and compliments of the Attorney General of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.069" offset="10119607">In approaching the case at bar, I wish to reiterate some of the matters that counsel has already covered in order that my presentation might assume a somewhat orderly form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.031" offset="10203512">This petition was first filed in the Supreme Court of Florida on or about March 24, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.404" offset="10260982">The petition contained only two points of law and two issues were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.078" offset="10295672">One issue had to do with whether or not his fundamental rights had been abridged by reason of his allegation that he was not furnished a copy of the information in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.173" offset="10368084">His original petition emphasized that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.454" offset="10389191">It almost stated, almost as an afterthought, that he had also been denied right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.573" offset="10429628">In our original response in the Supreme Court of Florida, we dedicated practically all of our response to his first position taken relative to the absence of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.737" offset="10498278">The court -- that also -- another reason why we did that is that particular question had never been passed upon by a Florida appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.377" offset="10536835">As to -- we have in our Constitution in -- in Article 11 of the Declaration of Rights saying that that must be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.019" offset="10579466">And so, our Supreme Court took the same position that they did in the Supreme Court of Alabama on an identical question and ruled that the record showed evident waiver of this right, also ruling that it's a ministerial function and unless the record affirmatively shows that it was not done, it will be assumed that the judge or the court did their duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.321" offset="11800639">Now, the history of this case is significant and I believe it will become increasingly so to the Court as we go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.878" offset="11850898">The dates involved here are particularly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.918" offset="11875035">On February the 24th, 1959, this Court reversed our Florida Supreme Court in the case of Ray Cash versus Culver, a similar case in some respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.871" offset="11946820">The petition, in this case, was filed subsequent to that reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.895" offset="11979003">The briefs were filed subsequent to that reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.748" offset="12002408">The opinion of our Florida Supreme Court in the instant case was filed after having received your reversal in Cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.793" offset="12062595">And thus, it is that we have continued in our brief and we do here that when our Supreme Court denied the relief requested by this man, it did so with the tones of reversal bringing clearly in those judicial ears, as you signified in the Cash case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.347" offset="12160711">In that Cash case, you laid down a yardstick for our Supreme Court to be guided by in such cases as this and we feel like that they have attempted to do so and we think that when we come to a comparison, a fair and honest logical comparison of the facts in this case, as applied to the yardstick which you supplied us in the Cash case, that we think that we have complied with your mandate and we believe that we can make that increasingly fair to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.597" offset="12317759">First, we realize that any obligation that we hope to furnish counsel in noncapital cases to indigent defendants is by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment and the -- and the previous opinions of this Court wherein, stated generally, the defendant, by reason of age, physical or mental incapacity, is not able to present any type of defense in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.754" offset="12494346">Now, this Court examined the Cash file and determined that he came within that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.606" offset="12545755">Taking that opinion and -- and comparing it to McNeal, we have this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.788" offset="12574490">First, we want to compare the records before the Court and this is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.133" offset="12595911">In Cash, that record came up here on a bare petition and a bare benial -- denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.705" offset="12634154">It's a practice in our court down there that if, in the opinion of the court, the petition does not contain sufficient allegations which would merit the writ -- the issuance of the writ, then they -- they simply enter a blank denial of the relief requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.008" offset="12743450">That is all that -- and at that time, our practice was, down there, was every Monday morning, we would load up our baskets full of the petitions and go over there to the court and as they would be called out, we would reply orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.731" offset="12838327">And if in our opinion we could not answer the allegations contained there, we would so advise the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.217" offset="12868211">The court would then issue the writ and further proceedings would be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.194" offset="12892139">If -- we took the position that if all these allegations, even if admitted, were not yet sufficient to -- to be awarded relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4641.796" offset="18670529">We're again comparing him with Cash since that again is the formula that you furnished us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.352" offset="18700831">And we say that another thing that probably influenced this Court in Cash was that he was a -- an uneducated farm boy of 20 years old wherein McNeal was a 29-year old Negro man, a veteran of almost six years in the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.311" offset="18780662">There again would indicate if they kept him six years, it would indicate that he was not completely devoid of some mentality, that he was a GI student.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.284" offset="18836459">I assume that he was a GI student because he says "I -- I get money for going to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.177" offset="18856103">The Government pays me for going to school," and that's the only way I know that -- that you could get that pay, that he was an employee at a nursery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.927" offset="18899048">Now, that would indicate a man of at least a normal intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.433" offset="18921096">The -- another thing we feel that -- that influenced this Court in the Cash case was that Cash was tried twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.513" offset="18957458">The first time he was represented by an able -- able lawyer from the Dade County Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.545" offset="18981595">That trial ended in a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.327" offset="18996642">While he was -- after that trial, he was sent back to Raiford and placed in solitary confinement and his lawyer withdrew from the case without his knowledge until just prior to the time he was brought back to be tried again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.219" offset="19060276">And the second trial, he was not represented by counsel and they convict him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.766" offset="19094444">At least this Court recognized the first mistrial as a concrete evidence of the help that a lawyer gave him that he -- that was unavailable to him in the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.046" offset="19147525">We have no such indication of innocence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.836" offset="19162676">Now, this opportunity to obtain counsel is another thing that we feel that this -- this case should turn on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.826" offset="19198725">Cash, as going again as comparison, as I said, Cash was placed in solitary confinement immediately after his first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.473" offset="19233311">He was unable to obtain counsel and he asked for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.335" offset="19264763">When he went to court at the first opportunity, he asked the court to "give me time to get counsel of my own choice or in the alternative, please appoint one for me."</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.181" offset="19324113">McNeal had much more opportunity than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.757" offset="19338428">He was arrested on the night of his offense on -- on November 10th, 1958 or 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.990" offset="19371342">And thereafter, in February, he was convicted some over three months between the time he was arrested and the time he was convicted and the -- he does not allege that he was in jail during this three months and the record doesn't reflect whether or not he was in jail but we get the reasonable indication from the record that he was not in jail during this three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.450" offset="19489207">And we say it's reasonable and logical because in his testimony, the -- he was asked, "Do you draw compensation?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.980" offset="19527241">His answer was "I draw compensation for the school but the pension was cut off."</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.860" offset="19562768">Question, "What kind of work do you do?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.809" offset="19574575">Answer, "I work at the nursery in Lake Garfield."</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.695" offset="19598190">This matter took place down in the garden spot of Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="6302.853" offset="25314826">The counsel for respondent has taken the position that the Florida rule as to voluntariness of admissions is not a rule as to admissions but as only as it applies to confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6316.560" offset="25369579">At page 18 of our brief, we quote from the Louette case and the second paragraph of it discusses incriminating admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.167" offset="25412002">The rule clearly applies to admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.910" offset="25422973">If we turn over to the page 22 of our brief, the same thing is said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.022" offset="25447424">The language has used "admissions or confessions".</text>
            <text syncTime="6340.188" offset="25464142">The admission in this case was not only concerning the fact that somebody was shot but the crucial element in the admissions was the intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6351.638" offset="25509909">That's what they needed in this record and that's what they got from these three police officers that he intended to kill Scurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.053" offset="25539584">Now, on one moment, the counsel for respondent says that since he got up and testified that "I meant to scare him" that he admitted in crime of second -- of assault with intent to commit second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="6374.074" offset="25599666">That isn't correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.654" offset="25606040">The Williams case, which is cited in our brief, says that no one can be punished under the assault with intent to commit felony statute unless there is an intent to kill, that the gist of the offense is intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6393.346" offset="25676779">The scaring testimony would be a five-year offense at most and he did not confess to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6400.448" offset="25705200">I won't go into the record but I'll leave respectfully with Your Honors the fact that after he said, "I meant to scare them," the prosecution came in and said, "You said you meant to scare them?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.274" offset="25752430">And he said, "I must have meant to scare them."</text>
            <text syncTime="6415.794" offset="25766536">But this goes back to the words that were put in his mouth by the prosecu -- by the arresting officers who had to tell him what he had done on the night of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.726" offset="25810317">Now, counsel takes the position that this case is distinguishable from Cash because Cash was only a habeas corpus posi -- petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6438.540" offset="25857546">The facts in the Cash case were true only in the pick wiki in a sense of a habeas corpus allegation but the thing that makes this case such a monstrous front to the Due Process Clause is that the -- these facts are proven to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6454.673" offset="25922017">Here is a record furnished by the State which shows what happened to this man, shows that we did have an ignorant and mentally unbalanced man that was put to trial in a complicated case that could not defend himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.539" offset="25977501">These aren't allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.918" offset="25983039">These are facts proven by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6472.960" offset="25995264">The claim is made that the petitioner furnished the record to the State in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.766" offset="26026402">The fact finding power of those in prison is rather limited and I would call Your Honors' attention, first, to page 24 of the record which describes the transcript of testimony as Exhibit D attached to the respondent's return.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.767" offset="26094425">The State of Florida prepared this record and it is shown that that is the fact that's attached to their return.</text>
            <text syncTime="6506.391" offset="26128906">Now, petitioner was so upset when he received this return in Raiford without a copy of the trial testimony that he filed the motion in the Supreme Court of Florida which is contained at page16 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6522.599" offset="26193795">And he says, "The State has filed a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.070" offset="26207692">They had Exhibit C and D, including the trial testimony and I didn't get a copy of it and I can't make any reply to the return because I don't have a copy of it."</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.885" offset="26254921">Not only did the petitioner not prepare the record but he wasn't sure it was a copy of the record until some later date.So I think all of the discussion that was had about how this petitioner prepared the record is beyond me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.836" offset="26322735">This record was prepared by the State and it was not served on petitioner inquiries and until some further proceedings were taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="6566.692" offset="26370173">The contention is made that the claimed right to counsel is a pure afterthought in a mere makeweight argument thrown in the petition for habeas corpus below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6579.099" offset="26419806">If Your Honors will examine pages 7 to 14 of this printed record, which is half of the petition itself, you will find rather eloquent language of a good prison lawyer discussing vigorously the right to counsel, citing all of the cases that we're talking about today using the fine language of Mr. Langbein in the Cash case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6605.378" offset="26524923">This is not an afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="6607.424" offset="26533073">The suggestion that the Florida practice is to furnish counsel and so on leads me to ask this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.178" offset="26568077">If it's so customary to appoint counsel in Florida, why is it that admittedly half of the habeas corpus petitions in the State come from the fact that they were tried without counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="6627.842" offset="26614784">As to the fact that McNeal's cross-examination was so brilliantly conducted, I call Your Honors' attention to the cold facts of the record at page 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="6637.996" offset="26655326">He wanted to argue about whether the prosecuting witness had struck him or whether it was his brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.504" offset="26685419">And he made the statement, "You said you hit me but Earnest was the one that hit me."</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.514" offset="26705377">The court stopped him right there and said, "No, that is testifying."</text>
            <text syncTime="6654.961" offset="26723244">Now, that's the last thing that the petitioner ever said at his trial on his behalf other than his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="6662.655" offset="26753964">Now, question was asked concerning the judge's help and how judges help these indigent and defenseless prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="6672.532" offset="26793462">That page right there shows how much the judge helped him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6675.997" offset="26807359">If we read the questions that the judge did ask, he didn't ask what the petitioner was trying to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6683.714" offset="26838183">He didn't ask which of the Scurry's hit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.080" offset="26851662">He didn't do that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6688.351" offset="26856782">But what did he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="6689.912" offset="26863052">He extended a guiding hand to the prosecution because it forgot to prove its element of premeditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.788" offset="26890533">It forgot to ask if when McNeal was first in the "Blue Chip", he had a shotgun with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6703.140" offset="26915924">Is the trial judge helping this petitioner when he's asked of the witness, "Did he have a gun or anything with him when he was in there that you know about?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6712.168" offset="26952077">Answer, "No."</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.669" offset="26958033">Why would the Court ask that question?</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.007" offset="26967437">For one and only one reason, to prove that McNeal had to leave the café, go somewhere and get a shotgun and come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.288" offset="27000560">That's not much this trial judge helped this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.623" offset="27017906">And I defy any explanation of the refusal to conduct a medical examination under the Florida statute when not only did the record show release from the psychotic ward within 13 months prior to the commission of the offense but through one extent, Mr. Justice Whittaker, in answer to your question, I should have told you that, at page 42 of the record, the testimony is that, while he was discharged 13 months ago, he still went back to the hospital to get pills.</text>
            <text syncTime="6771.249" offset="27188328">That is the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6772.760" offset="27194389">He was receiving treatment of some kind, presumably tranquilizers, I don't know, at the time of the commission of his offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6781.574" offset="27229706">Now, it is argued that since petitioner had enough sense to stay in the Army for six years, then he had enough sense to conduct his own defense in this criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6790.945" offset="27267114">I deny the validity of the major premise and also point out that we do not know when his head injuries were received with reference to his service in the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.477" offset="27313298">If his head injuries were received upon discharge, then the fact that he was in the Army would mean nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6810.277" offset="27344436">As to what being a GI student means in this record, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.587" offset="27361677">There are trade schools that you can go to under the GI Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.217" offset="27376201">I suppose you can go to high school or any other school on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.804" offset="27390621">We come back to this fundamental proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.090" offset="27407757">This is not a case where we have to sit and read allegations and then say inquiry must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6836.244" offset="27448299">This is a case where we know what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.372" offset="27460838">It's proven by the records furnished by the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.579" offset="27477661">This is not something that we might get excited about in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.188" offset="27496155">This is the cold brutal facts of what went on in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.875" offset="27514859">This ignorant, mentally unbalanced petitioner was tried without counsel in a case that involved extremely complicated issues of substantive law so complicated that the learned Attorney General, in speaking this morning, has made some statements which we are in a position to deny on the substantive issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6872.997" offset="27595316">The evidentiary problems are complicated enough that we're even arguing them here before Your Honors this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.904" offset="27623006">Add the man that the petitioner was, the defense which he could not make but so desperately needed and add the type of issues that were involved in this case and we respectfully submit that the trial below in the State of Florida was much more upfront to the fundamental dignities of mankind.</text>
