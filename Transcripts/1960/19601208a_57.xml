            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="13.509" offset="157445">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.760" offset="166431">This is actually two cases and they are consolidated for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.276" offset="184508">The Lucchese case is here on writ of certiorari, but also the Costello case Number 59 is being argued with Lucchese on one question that that question that was raised by the motion for leave to amend the petition in Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.295" offset="268518">In the 1955 term, this Court held in United States v. Zucca that a denaturalization proceeding could not be maintained without filing in Court the affidavit of good cause required by Section 340 (a) of the Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.456" offset="345213">These cases arise from the Government's attempt to comply with those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.985" offset="371336">In both of these cases as in Zucca, the affidavit of good cause was not filed with the original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.981" offset="403310">After the Zucca decision however, the Government did file affidavits in attempt to cure the original defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.655" offset="438000">The Second Circuit in both cases held that that late filing was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.530" offset="461511">This Court, however, granted certiorari and in per curiam orders, reversed the judgments and remanded the cases with directions to dismiss the complaints saying and the order appears in new Lucchese at page 29 an affidavit showing good cause as a prerequisite to the initiation of the denaturalization proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.126" offset="551894">The affidavit must be filed with the complaint when the proceedings are instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.330" offset="576658">On remand of the -- of these two cases to the District Courts, Lucchese to the Eastern District of New York and Costello to the Southern District, the Government submitted proposed judgments dismissing the complaints without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.143" offset="635904">The District Courts in each case, however, felt that they were bound by this Court's mandate simply to dismiss without specifying the effect of the dismissal orders and the order in Lucchese is in the record at page 30 and 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.866" offset="710823">The dismissal order in Costello is not printed in the record, but we are -- by stipulation filed copies which I believe were distributed to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.434" offset="753142">As the Court will see there substantially identical and simply reciting the prior proceedings and judging that the complaints be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.376" offset="792848">Now up to that point, the two cases are identical for all material purposes and it's only after that point that they're filed separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.223" offset="832240">In Costello, the Government did not appeal from the dismissal order, but rather simply filed the new complaint with the required affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.693" offset="874141">It was met, however with the claim by Costello that since the dismissal order of the prior action did not specify that it was without prejudice, it operated by force of Rule 41 (b) as a dismissal with prejudice and barred the new action.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.712" offset="946239">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected that argument and it's that question that Costello seeks to raise by the motion to amend the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.582" offset="985736">This Court granted the main petition in the Costello which raises other questions which are being argued separately, did not act on the motion to leave to amend the petition and set that motion down for argument together with Lucchese.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.048" offset="1047594">Now, in the meantime, because of the res judicata argument being made in the Costello, the Government sought to protect itself in Lucchese by appealing in the original proceedings themselves from the refusal of the District Court to act without prejudice to a dismissal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.875" offset="1130872">The Court of Appeals dismissed that appeal on the ground that the District Court had no power on remand to do anything more than dismiss as this Court had said without embellishment or elaboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.828" offset="1190640">The Court granted certiorari on the Government's petition and as I say, consolidated that with the Costello motion.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="279.168" offset="1220002">Mr. Barnett, it's a little complicated procedure to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.098" offset="1235780">The basic issue is simply not I expected sure enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.925" offset="1259081">What was the chronology in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="292.174" offset="1272038">Did the Costello appeal get there ahead of the Lucchese appeal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="295.270" stopTime="303.277">
            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="295.270" offset="1284472">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.394" offset="1288965">The Lucchese appeal was -- I'm not sure when they were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.825" offset="1302653">The Lucchese appeal was decided before the Costello.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="303.277" stopTime="303.827">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="303.277" offset="1316446">Before?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="303.827" stopTime="651.313">
            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="303.827" offset="1318640">Yes and we had filed our petition before Costello petition was due here for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.197" offset="1348211">And actually, we filed our -- our petition was primarily a protective one just in case the Court took the question in Costello so we would be protected in Lucchese.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.473" offset="1385305">I would like to clarify my position on the motion to amend in the Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.585" offset="1409755">Now, when that was filed we opposed it for among other reasons, the fact that there was no good cause but failing to raise issue in the original petition and the Court ought not encourage peace bill petitions, but now that the Court has granted Lucchese, they said in there, the Costello motion is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.824" offset="1498676">The questions are obviously closely related and if the Court is going to hear and determine Lucchese on the merits, we don't see how we can continue to oppose hearing also the question in the Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.723" offset="1554265">So unless the Court concludes that it should dismiss Lucchese also, we don't oppose the motion to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.995" offset="1591359">Turning the merits, I'll deal first of the Costello case and the question there posed the effect of the dismissal order on later proceedings, because I think that's the basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.631" offset="1645902">His argument, as I say is that, since the order did not specify, there was without prejudice that operated under Rule 41 (b) as a dismissal with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.157" offset="1691982">The Court of Appeals said that argument is based entirely on pure technicality since judgment (Inaudible), because one thing that is clear is that no Court that has ever been involved in these proceedings intended or contemplated that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.975" offset="1771290">In the prior proceedings from the Zucca case itself, the Court affirmed the judgment dismissing the complaint without prejudice to new proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.282" offset="1808488">When these cases were here before, they were here with four -- with two other cases, a total of four cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.367" offset="1836805">In the Lucchese case and in the Costello -- well, in the Lucchese case and the Diamond case from the Ninth Circuit, the District Courts had dismissed without prejudice because of the lack of the affidavit and in the Costello case, the District Court had dismissed without prejudice though for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.108" offset="1923845">In the fourth case that came up, the Mattels case the District Court had refused to dismiss at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.368" offset="1948818">Now, in the Second Circuit to which three other cases went and the major opinion was written in Mattels, the Court stated the question to be whether the late filing of the affidavit was sufficient or whether the Government was required to institute a new proceeding with a new service or process.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.350" offset="2040769">That was the question and this Court, when it took the case and simply stated that the complaint had to be filed with the -- the affidavit had to be filed with the complaint and directed the District Court to dismiss, decided nothing more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.526" offset="2101478">I think that is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.009" offset="2111404">So, the main problem is how we can avoid that unintended result of how the Rule 41 (b) can be fairly construed not to produce that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.309" offset="2164590">The Rule, it's quoted in our Costello brief at page 5, the last sentence, by the way when I speak of Rule 41 (b), I'm referring only to the last sentence which is the only part involved here, with pertinent substance that unless the Court otherwise specifies in the order a dismissal other than dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or venue shall operate as an adjudication on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.350" offset="2284753">Now there are two ways to approach the interpretation of the rule One, adopted by the District Court is to say that the dismissal here was for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.742" offset="2334386">That by the way is the characterization of the dismissal that was adopted I think by all of the defendants in the prior proceedings when they moved to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.564" offset="2365628">They filed their motions to dismiss under Rule 12 (b) as motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.579" offset="2401677">Now the jurisdiction of course means different things for different purposes and I think the question really is how should be construed for purposes of this rule and that turns on what purposes of the rule are and the basic purpose I think is evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.394" offset="2476910">The rules give to the Court a discretionary power in a number of instances to specify the effect of the dismissal, to make it with prejudice or without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.569" offset="2521631">That is true of dismissals for one of prosecution for failure to state a claim, for failure to comply with an order and for insufficiency of proof by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.248" offset="2572413">Now, having the discretion to make the dismissal either way, you needed a presumption to control the case where the Court failed to say which way he was exercising his power and that's what Rule 41 (b) does.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.579" offset="2621733">It says that unless it is otherwise specified, he shall be deemed to exercise the power to dismiss with prejudice and that I think is not -- is not too great of a burden on the plaintiff because he knows in that kind of situation that the dismissal maybe one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.151" offset="2696025">He can see to it specifies but it's intended.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="651.313" stopTime="664.567">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="651.313" offset="2708668">That's all (Inaudible) in the dismissal of silence is a dismissal of this prejudice?</text>
            <text syncTime="660.168" offset="2744090">The Rule exempted that other than a dismissal (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="665.454" offset="2765197">No I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.036" offset="2767496">I didn't make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.013" offset="2771466">That is one of the exemptions and the District Court held that we are within that exemption and that is really what I'm arguing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_e_whittaker" startTime="673.007" stopTime="685.732">
            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="673.007" offset="2795395">But that is not what the judgment says.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.756" offset="2806366">If it it's not revived, the dismissal would direct you to one jurisdiction, the dismissals are not in place.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="685.732" stopTime="1244.123">
            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="685.732" offset="2846281">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.310" offset="2848580">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.659" offset="2850043">And our argument is that it was for lack of jurisdiction as that term is used in this Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.029" offset="2875538">Now we acknowledge that it is not a jurisdictional defect for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.286" offset="2892466">It's certainly we would say does not subject a final judgment to collateral attack for lack of that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.605" offset="2929768">But -- excuse me, you have to give jurisdictions used in this Rule quite a -- a broad scope to include what might be called quasi jurisdictional defects because I -- I can suggest the scope of dismissals where I think the rule would be -- produce the result that was certainly not intended otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.711" offset="3018167">We -- the problem isn't limited to this particular dismissal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.206" offset="3044185">There are a variety of dismissals which no one I think has ever thought would bar later proceedings, nothing in the rules purports to give the judge power to make them with prejudice and which can be accepted only if you put them under the heading of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.031" offset="3115447">For example, a dismissal of a tax refund suit for failure to file an administrative claim for refund, a dismissal for failure to exhaust the administrative remedies, a dismissal of a National Labor Relations Board application for an injunction against the temporary boycott -- a secondary boycott for failure to make a preliminary investigation, dismissals for lack of an indispensable party, for lack of the real party interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.049" offset="3255568">If all of these kinds of standard or specialized grounds for dismissal rising out statutory preconditions to sue, which I do not think were ever intended to the grounds for dismissals with the prejudice and we would say that all of these ought to be characterized for this particular purpose as dismissals for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.707" offset="3358177">What they have in common is that they -- as fair as I precondition to suit and it stops the litigation, a threshold is never an opportunity to litigate the merits and for -- for purposes of res judicata, they are exactly like any other dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.781" offset="3462457">Now there's a -- a second approach which was adopted by Judge McGruder in his opinion for the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.098" offset="3495790">And I think it can be best phrased as turning on a construction of the beginning words unless the Court in a dismissal order otherwise specifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.058" offset="3543646">Now Costello says that -- argues that an order otherwise specifies only if it uses the magic words without prejudice, but we think that -- in light of the purpose to rule, there's no reason so limit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.990" offset="3611355">As I've said, the main purpose is to remove the ambiguity in cases where it is not clear whether the dismissal is on the merits or whether the District Court has exercised a discretionary power to impose a dismissal with prejudice as a sanction for some dilatory tactic or -- or for castrating in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.280" offset="3712502">Now, if that is the purpose of the Rule, it seems to me that an order specifies otherwise even if it does not say without prejudice, so long as it makes clear by any form of words that there has been no determination on the merits and that the District Court is not proportioned to exercise a discretionary power to impose a dismissal having the same effect as one of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.058" offset="3827649">Now, that is precisely, I think, what the order in Costello shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.965" offset="3843218">It clearly shows that -- as Judge McGruder said, that there's been no -- no determination on the merits and that the District Court did not exercise whatever discretionary power he may have had if he had any to make it with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.214" offset="3904240">And we think such an order is one otherwise specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.234" offset="3924302">And, I think that is fully in accordance with everything that this Court has this far intended in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.932" offset="3963068">I'd like to turn briefly to the Lucchese case, which actually the result will turn primarily upon the result in Costello.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.268" offset="4012492">If a Court accepts our view in Costello that the original order was not barred with the second suit and for all practical purposes, that -- that moots the question in Lucchese because we were aggrieved by the failure to say without prejudice only because of the doubt of what the effects of the order would be otherwise and if this Court settles the doubt, there's no longer a practically important issue in Lucchese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.220" offset="4124296">On the other hand, if the Court disagrees who doesn't hope there is a bar, then I think it's clear from what I've already said that the District Court erred in Lucchese in not adding the words without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.667" offset="4186049">So I think the only separate question arising in the Lucchese is the procedural one raised by Lucchese, namely, whether the Government by appealing followed the wrong the procedure to correct the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.166" offset="4248012">Lucchese's argument is -- is that the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.229" offset="4272253">It just simply does not have power to decide questions of compliance with this Court's mandates and he argues that this is that kind of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.856" offset="4314781">Now, even accepting the premise, I think the short answer is that this is not a question of compliance with this Court's mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.936" offset="4347068">It is clear that the Court in directing -- remanding case with direction to dismiss did not purport to pass on the question of the nature of the dismissal and that it should with or without prejudice and it was therefore in matter not within the scope of the mandate and a new issue which the Court of Appeals is free to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.971" offset="4439228">And that's really all the Court has to decide in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.074" offset="4451662">But I would like to say that we, by no means, agree with the premise of Lucchese is that there are any limits on what the Court of Appeals can do in reviewing actions by a District Court, simply because it involves among other things or solely a question of interpretation of a mandate of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.612" offset="4549778">The -- there are -- there are Court of Appeals' decisions supporting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.005" offset="4591365">We think that they are the product simply of a historical oversight and I will only very briefly suggest what that is because I suggest that the Court needs to reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.489" offset="4657298">The -- in cases prior to 1891 in this Court, the Court established that questions of compliance with these mandates could be reviewed by it either on mandamus or by appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.002" offset="4719365">Now, of course before 1891 there were no Courts of Appeals and so it was perfectly clear that any appeal lay only to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.342" offset="4748727">Now, it would seem to have followed that when the Courts of Appeals were created in 1891 and since the questions could be reviewed by ordinary Courts of Appeal that you could appeal the Court of Appeals from a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.769" offset="4806405">But the -- in later cases, this Court did not carefully make that distinction and continued to repeat the old language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.048" offset="4843604">In fact however, all the cases held were that the remedy of mandamus to enforce a mandate had to be sought in the Supreme Court and not in the Court of Appeals and although as I say that the -- some Courts of Appeals have said they have no jurisdiction of appeal, we think that there's no valid reason whatsoever for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.229" offset="4944332">It simply confuses the processes of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.830" offset="4958647">Lucchese says that if it raises a new issue, we must go to the Court of Appeals, but if it raises something within the scope of the mandate we must somehow come to this Court and -- but the question of whether or not the matter is foreclosed by the original mandate, is usually the very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.512" offset="5045373">And so, you have to decide the merits before you decide jurisdiction and I think it would only produce unnecessary protective applications to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.681" offset="5354141">I'm speaking on behalf of the respondent Lucchese and I agree with the Solicitor that if the Costello case is decided adversely to Costello, then the question involved in the Lucchese case becomes entirely academic because the question involved in the Lucchese case has only to do ultimately with whether the District Court obeyed this Court's mandates or not when it entered its order of dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.205" offset="5484231">I would like to initially answer Justice Stewart's question about the Ringhiser case in the Sixth Circuit because that has to do with the first point that I want to discuss and there the District Court purporting to obey a Supreme Court mandate had entered an order unsatisfactory to one of the parties and the party appealed to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal stating specifically that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction of the question whether a District Court has or has not complied with the Supreme Court mandate and that is entirely a question for this Court to determine and a party complaining that the District Court is not complying with this Court's mandate must come to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.723" offset="5726229">And the basis and authority for that proposition is not only in Court of Appeals cases but in this Court and I have cited the case in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.700" offset="5782131">It's in 207 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.026" offset="5795506">It had to do where the case where a Circuit Court of appeals had assumed the power to determine whether a District Court was complying or not with the mandate and this Court there stated and I've quoted the language in my brief "The Circuit Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction of the matter."</text>

            <text syncTime="1859.696" offset="7542157">Instead, they have become concerned about the form of the judgment, but the point that I would like to make is that the Government in the relief that is asking this Court for ignores the procedural posture in which the Lucchese case is here, because I moved in the Court of Appeals to dismiss their appeal on the ground that I have discussed a few moments ago that they lacked jurisdiction to consider the question at all and they granted my motion and entered an order which is in the record in which it states that a motion having been made to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.330" offset="7720730">Then they added what I have maintained as a dictum the words that in any event the District Court, they don't say in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.025" offset="7759496">They said the District Court had no basis to take any other action then it did and we will not pass now upon possible effect of that on future litigation, but what I say is that if the Court of Appeals intended to consider this question on the merits as to whether the District Court should or should not enter an order without prejudice in cases like this or in this case, I would assume that it would have had a full dress argument and appeal on the matter rather than dismissing it on my motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.797" offset="7902542">It is what they did and what the Government is here reviewing by certiorari is whether a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was correct in the Court of Appeals and they're asking for the relief that you direct the District Court to add the words without prejudice to the order in the Lucchese case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.506" offset="8057396">Because -- and I -- and I finished speaking of that ground getting down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.212" offset="8076204">If this Court will -- intends to consider or does consider the question about whether to issue directions to the District Court and what sort of an order the District Court should have entered whether it did or did not comply with this Court's judgment and I want to discuss that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.310" offset="8160632">Of course I feel as the -- as the Court of Appeals commented in its opinion and as both District Judges felt, that they had no business adding words to what this Court had directed, but the Government says that it was implied in this Court's judgment that these words without prejudice to refer the proceeding should be added to the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.602" offset="8253733">And, it seems to me very clear that no matter what else one may say that no such thing was implied in this Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.421" offset="8289050">This Court, if it had -- if it had adverted to that question and meant to either imply it or expressly say it could well have said in Lucchese that the Court of Appeals' decision which was adverse to Lucchese is reversed and the District Court's order is reinstated because the original District Court's order in Lucchese had been without prejudice to a further proceeding by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.949" offset="8403153">But instead of simply reinstating the District Court's order that this Court specifically said it's remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the complaint and stopped there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.408" offset="8449024">So that I don't see how any District Court would imply or would think that it was implied in that statement that they should simply put back into effect their original order, this Court not having told them to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.307" offset="8720593">I don't believe I reach that point Lucchese that it's necessary for me to reach that point because all the -- all the District Courts had to determine was whether it was necessarily implied in this Court's order that it should add these words without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.548" offset="8793527">If it were -- if it were jurisdictional under Rule 41, there would be no occasion for adding the words without prejudice because it would be without prejudice anyway under the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.064" offset="8839607">So there was no way that the District Court could feel that there was an applied direction to add without prejudice.</text>
