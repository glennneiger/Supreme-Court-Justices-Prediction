            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 9, John Francis Noto, Petitioner, versus United States.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="22.022" stopTime="309.419">
            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="22.022" offset="191509">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.456" offset="217213">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.409" offset="229021">This case, like Scales, involves a conviction under the membership clause of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.497" offset="261308">The two indictments are identical in form and were returned within about 10 days of each other in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.988" offset="303313">Noto was tried in the Western District of New York in 1956, about a year after the first trial in Scales and his conviction was affirmed in the Second Circuit in 1958 shortly after the affirmance of Scales' conviction by the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.090" offset="379695">The two cases raised the same questions with respect to the constitutionality of the membership clause and the effect of Section 4 (f) of the Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.344" offset="424730">And I shall have something to add to what has already been said on these questions a little bit later.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.880" offset="450853">However, I do not think that it will be necessary for the Court to reach these questions in this case because under the standards of Yates versus United States and Nowak versus United States, the record in this case unequivocally demands the -- a judgment of acquittal for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.563" offset="541654">At the trial, the petitioner did not dispute that he was a member of the Communist Party and that he had held leading positions in the Party in its western New York organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.562" offset="589615">The indictment, like the Scales indictment, contained no allegation and unlike Scales, the Court here gave no instruction with respect to what the Government now calls the activity factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.249" offset="648338">Since the Government didn't discover the existence of that factor as an ingredient of the offence until several years after Noto's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.647" offset="689925">The issues therefore at the trial were whether petitioner have the knowledge and the intent charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.492" offset="725347">The indictment charges that Noto had knowledge that the Communist Party was engaged in advocating forcible overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.333" offset="760665">This Court held in Yates at the advocacy proscribed by the Smith Act, his advocacy of action as distinguished from advocacy of belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.461" offset="797236">Obviously, petitioner couldn't know that the Party was engaged in such advocacy, that is to say advocacy of action, if in fact it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.424" offset="837047">Accordingly, the prosecution was required to prove that the Party incited action for forcible overthrow and the trial court so instructed the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.467" offset="877275">This, of course, is a proposition with respect to the Communist Party that this Court held that the Government had been unable to prove in the Yates case, stating that the record on this issue was strikingly deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.448" offset="933177">Similarly, the Second Circuit held that the same proposition had not been proved in two Smith Act conspiracy cases that followed the Yates decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.419" offset="981034">In the present case, however, the court below never considered whether the evidence in this case supply to deficiency which had been found in the records in these three earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.960" offset="1035264">Instead, it held that the incitement to action standard is inapplicable to prosecutions under the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.851" offset="1074761">This appears both from the Court's explicit statement to that effect and from its failure to mention or apply the standards in delineating the issues and discussing the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.032" offset="1123453">And I'll call the Court's attention to the record at page 449 for the explicit statement by the Court and 439 to 442 for delineation of the issues and discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.856" offset="1186774">The Court seems to have thought that Yates is inapplicable because the accused in a membership case has not charged himself with advocating anything and because for some reason that the Court never stated, the incitement standard does not apply to the advocacy of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.406" offset="1265037">By reading incitement out of the membership clause, the Court sustained the conviction on a record which has its own statement of the evidence at the point in which decision to which I've already referred the Court shows, differs in no -- nor in significant respect whatsoever from the record which Yates stated was strikingly deficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.127" offset="3555871">And sixth, and finally, evidence that the parties press the need of recruiting members and influencing workers in the basic industries of the nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.572" offset="3769657">Certainly, there was nothing unique in Lautner's twice-told tale nor was there was anything unique in the testimony of five additional witnesses who did not appear in the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.512" offset="3821380">The Government says that the significant aspect of the testimony of these five witnesses related to industrial concentration and the underground.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.541" offset="3861504">This evidence is summarized at pages 37 to 38 of the Government's brief on which it will readily appear that the witnesses added nothing to what Lautner have provided too on these subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.916" offset="3915003">The Government seems to acknowledge that the evidence concerning Party instruction and Marxism and Leninism, taken by itself, shows no more than the advocacy of abstract doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.078" offset="3963695">It argues however, that this instruction is transmuted into incitement to action by the Party's program of industrial concentration and the establishment of an underground organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.451" offset="4017194">But to say this is not the distinguish Yates but merely to resurrect the arguments that Yates rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.926" offset="4047078">Indeed, while the Government argues here that it has met the incitement standard, its action in other Smith Act cases relies its words.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.823" offset="4090650">Subsequent to this Court's decision in Yates, 12 of the 13 pending Smith Act conspiracy prosecutions were terminated in favor of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.429" offset="4137044">Four of these were disposed off by directions for judgments of acquittal in the Second and Tenth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.175" offset="4164106">In the remaining eight cases, the indictments were dismissed on motion of the Government with the explanation that the Yates standard could not be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.470" offset="4205275">This would seem to be an acknowledgement that the Government cannot cure the deficiency in the Yates record that the court -- that this Court pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.797" offset="4242578">For -- if evidence were available to prove what was not proved there, that is that the Communist Party incites violent overthrow and therefore, constitutes the conspiratorial group, it's just inconceivable that the Government would have abandoned the effort to convict at least some of the Party leaders who were named in these indictments as participants in that conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.195" offset="4344142">Thus, while the Government here formally contends that Yates is distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.818" offset="4366608">What it really is asking is that the Court overruled the Yates decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.980" offset="4387297">Yet, it advances and can advance, no reason for this Court to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.405" offset="4409031">Indeed, this would be a most inappropriate case even to urge the Court to overrule Yates because the fact is that here, the evidence would be insufficient, even a proof of advocacy of abstract doctrine by the Communist Party were sufficient to satisfy the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.173" offset="4488025">This is so, because in this case, the Government introduced no evidence that the Party advocated forcible overthrow even in the sense of advocacy of abstract doctrine within the period of the statute limitations that is in September 1, 1951 for the date of the indictments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.534" offset="4741517">The only evidence the Party advocacy within the limitations period was offered by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.875" offset="4762833">It consisted of writings by the Chairman of the Party, advocating the establishment of socialism by peaceful parliamentary means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.909" offset="4798986">The court below ignored petitioner's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.132" offset="4811943">It made up for absence of any prosecution evidence on the subject by invoking an inference and I quote from the court's opinion, "That the character of the Party, as a group, dedicated to violent overthrow of the Government, established in prior years continued unaltered through the statutory period."</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.572" offset="4889684">And the Government here, likewise, relies on the same inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.789" offset="4906506">But the issue in this case obviously, is not the general character of the Party or to what goal it was dedicated during the limitation's period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.644" offset="4941928">The issue is whether within that period, the Party performs certain verbal acts, the utterance or publication of words advocating forcible overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.315" offset="4988635">So called, presumption of continuance applies only where the existence of some condition, quality or tendency is in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.799" offset="5026565">It does not and purely, it cannot, at any application for the performance of an act at a given time is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.982" offset="5063346">For example, no lawyer, in his right mind, would argue that because I had a record of five previous convictions for driving through a red light at the corner of 16th and K Streets that it would be presumed that I drove through the same light of some time after September 1, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.427" offset="5145057">It's just as absurd to argue that if the jury had found that the Communist Party had advocated forcible overthrow prior to September 1, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.207" offset="5188211">He was entitled to infer that the Party engaged in some -- in the same advocacy that sometime thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.820" offset="5222693">This would substitute a presumption of guilt or the constitutional presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.741" offset="5246307">Moreover, even of such a presumption or otherwise permissible and I think plainly, it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.580" offset="5269713">It was rebutted by the uncontradicted evidence that petitioner's advocacy during the limitations period was peaceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.974" offset="5307225">I now turn to the evidence concerning petitioner's knowledge and intent and for that purpose, I'll assume that the prosecution proved that the Communist Party incited forceful overthrow within the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.663" offset="5361977">Even on that assumption, the conviction cannot stand where there was a complete failure of proof on the issue of guilty knowledge and guilty intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.485" offset="5401266">Prosecution called nine witnesses in additional to Lautner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.536" offset="5417566">Five were former Party members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.085" offset="5427702">Three of them had joined the -- the Party as paid spies for the F.B.I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.348" offset="5452779">The four remaining witnesses merely identified the petitioner as having lived and held a factory job in New Jersey under another name in the years 1953 to 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.165" offset="5504084">The prosecution witnesses praised petitioner's membership and activity in the Communist -- in the Young Communist League in the Communist Party from his high school days in 1933 and 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.580" offset="5557687">The evidence pictured him as a devoted communist who believe in the ultimate victory of socialism in this country but there's not a suggestion in the record that he so much as predicted forcible overthrow, let alone incited action that bring it about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.865" offset="5626859">Indeed, the record contains only one instance in which a reference was made to forcible overthrow in petitioner's presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.670" offset="5670013">This was said to have occurred in 1935, 20 years before the return of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.690" offset="5694151">When an instructor in a class conducted by the Young Communist League stated that resort to forcible overthrow wouldn't be historically necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.952" offset="5759143">Assuming the relevance and credibility of anything so remote, the statement was no more than a prediction about coming events and clearly fall short -- short of any incitement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.147" offset="5851930">The evidence for the prosecution showed that petitioner urged building the Communist Party among workers in heavy industry in the Buffalo area, that he had dealings with three witnesses about the purchase and concealment of printing presses for use in the event that the Party was denied access to commercial printing facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.224" offset="5932283">They discussed the matter of locating homes where people could takeaway refuge if they had to go into hiding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.936" offset="6227153">There is no evidence of the so-called underground engaged or plan to engage in incitement, to violence or other unlawful activities, much less that petitioner knew of any such purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.787" offset="6278562">All that the evidence shows is that elaborate precautions were taken to protect the Party and its members against what was regarded as political prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.565" offset="6349615">The case for the prosecution on the issues of knowledge and intent that bottom rest on no more than the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.516" offset="6377409">First, that he was familiar with the classical writings in Marxism and Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.219" offset="6400293">Second, that he held positions of Party leadership in western New York and third, that he made a few innocuous remarks, the strongest of which I quoted from a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.477" offset="6449298">Nowak versus United States held a similar evidence including statements that I think come far closer to the boundary that separates the advocacy of belief from advocacy of action, were insufficient to prove that the petitioner in that case had knowledge that the Communist Party incites to violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.654" offset="6541981">And Schneiderman versus United States shows that similar evidence is likewise insufficient to establish the petioner to have the specific intent of bringing about violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.249" offset="6592345">The Government in its brief studiously avoids mentioning either of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.653" offset="6610004">Although together, what the decision in Yates as I see it, they're completely dispositive of all of the evidentiary issues in this -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.885" offset="6642918">On the standards of these decisions, there was a complete failure of proof as to each of the elements of the offense charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.580" offset="6673742">The Government was undergone misapprehension as to its burden of proof under the statute and the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.615" offset="6697880">Accordingly, this is a case whereas the Court stated in Yates, acquittal is unequivocally demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.003" offset="6735391">I shall pass over the next point argued in my brief that the conviction must be reversed because it was the pain on the faces of evidence and matters wholly outside the petitioner's knowledge and not otherwise connected up with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.234" offset="6796309">I argue the 4 (f) question at some length in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.733" offset="6826297">And I'd like to make only two observations briefly in addition to what was said here today on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.971" offset="6863287">First, the effect of 4 (f) on the membership clause of the Smith Act was by no means inadvertent as we suggested here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.827" offset="6918666">On the contrary, it was very conscious and highly deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.308" offset="6940609">If you read the legislative history which is summarized in my brief at page 44, I think what very clearly emerges is the fact that Congress fully understood that the privilege of self-incrimination forced it to choose between the registrations provision of the Subversive Activities Control Act on the one hand and the membership clause of the Smith Act on the hand as a method of reaching members of the Communist Party whose only over deck consistent in membership, and that they deliberately chose the registration provisions of the Subversive Activities Control Act to accomplish that purpose and for that reason, immunize communist -- members of the Communist Party from prosecution under the membership clause of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.266" offset="7188459">Something was said this morning about Counselman versus Hitchcock and I shall argue tomorrow in the Communist Party case that the registration provisions of the Subversive Activities Control Act are unconstitutional because they compel self-incrimination and that -- and in that connection, I point out that Section 4 (f) doesn't rescue these provisions because it doesn't satisfy the requirements of Counselman versus Hitchcock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.331" offset="7332655">The Congress was fully aware of the holding in Counselman versus Hitchcock and its -- the text of Section 4 (f) was prepared with the decision in that case and mine at least that Congress had the -- had the -- the text that had decision before them because the doctrine of Counselman versus Hitchcock was called to the attention of the Senate in the minority report of the Senate which commented on -- on the fact that Section 4 (f) was drafted by the Senate, didn't satisfy that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.632" offset="7513945">And it was called in the attention of the House by Congressman Sullivan at the time that the 4 (f) was amended to improve immunization against the prosecution for other criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.091" offset="7575698">And I believe also, my recollection is that the doctrine of Counselman versus Hitchcock was also adverted through -- in a letter by then Attorney General, now Mr. Justice Clark, to Congressman Celler who was then the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, so that Congress legislated the 4 (f) with Counselman versus Hitchcock in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.427" offset="7689070">Now, as I say, I'll argue tomorrow that plainly, 4 (f) doesn't satisfy the Counselman versus Hitchcock doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.629" offset="7721880">And if that argument is sound and I don't understand the Government to contend otherwise, then Section 4 (f) failed to accomplish its ultimate legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.446" offset="7765138">That is to insulate the registration provisions from attack on self-incrimination grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.262" offset="7792410">But that fact does not militate against giving effect to the limited immunity of Section 4 (f) before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.031" offset="7819473">As Mr. Taylor pointed out this morning, the Court was confronted with precisely this situation and United States versus Bryan or Bryan versus United States and Adams versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.612" offset="7869837">Both of those cases involve Section 3486 of the Criminal Code which provides that no testimony by a witness before a congressional committee shall be used as evidence in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.944" offset="7931173">That statute was originally inactive for the purpose of providing an immunity which would permit the compulsion of incriminating testimony before and -- from witnesses before congressional committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.556" offset="7981641">Purpose was nullified by the Court's decision in Counselman versus Hitchcock holding that the immunity conferred by this Section wasn't coextensive with a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.787" offset="8018526">Nevertheless, the Court is held in both the Bryan and Adams cases that effect must be given to the limited immunity which Section 3486 reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.246" offset="8068368">And so in the present case, I submit that there would be no inconsistency in holding on the one hand that Section 4 (f) bars the prosecution of communist under the membership clause but at the same time, deciding in the Communist Party case that the immunity conferred by 4 (f) is not broad enough to foreclose a claim of the privilege as a defense to registration under the Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.297" offset="8176515">Turning now to the constitutional issues, I want first to discuss the questions posed in the Court's order for re-argument with respect to the clear and present danger doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.655" offset="8226043">As I -- as I understood Mr. Davis this afternoon, he conceded that the membership clause must satisfy that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.849" offset="8266794">If we state my conclusion at the outset, it's my view that the term present danger clause is applicable and is violated by the membership clause both as a clause as written and as the Government proposes to embellish it with an attempt and activity and if this is so, whether the doctrine has given the Holmes, Brandeis interpretation or whether it's given the Hand and Vinson interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.692" offset="8378180">I suggest that it's important at the outset to state with some precision to make sure of the conduct which the membership clause proscribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.034" offset="8423528">It doesn't punish and accuse for its own advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.956" offset="8439202">Both has written and is now embellished by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.230" offset="8456338">It punishes him because of the advocacy of other members of the group for which he belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.848" offset="8486745">Accordingly, it is not advocacy but association that the membership clause makes permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.589" offset="8517778">As NAACP versus Alabama holds, freedom of association with a group engaged in advocacy is a form of the freedom of assembly and is -- is within the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.843" offset="8582771">Since the membership clause punishes association with such a group, that is to say with a group engaged in advocacy, the clear and present danger doctrine is applicable to the clause just as it is to any other restraint from the exercise for First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.742" offset="8658317">Question then is, how shall the clause -- how shall the doctrine be applied to the membership clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.248" offset="8696351">However, the doctrine is interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.191" offset="8708159">It focuses on the consequences of the conduct which is the object of the restraint in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.329" offset="8744730">It measures the validity of the restraint by the nature of the danger of any, which may be anticipated from the conduct sought to be restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.675" offset="8802095">The conduct which the membership clause would restrain by punishing it in the present case is Noto's membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.257" offset="8840443">The issue under the clear and present dangen -- danger doctrine therefore is not as to the danger from the advocacy of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.242" offset="8884328">That danger would be relevant only under a statute punishing advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.142" offset="8907943">The issue here is as to the danger from Noto's membership in the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.609" offset="8945768">In that connection, although De Jonge versus Oregon was not decided in terms to clear and present danger, I submit that it's decisive of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.469" offset="8989236">Statute in De Jonge punished association with an organization engaged in seditious advocacy by making it a crime to assist in the conduct of a meeting of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.273" offset="9036466">As construed by the state court, the statute makes such assistance, criminal, notwithstanding that the meeting was lawful and peaceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.366" offset="9076799">The Court invalidated the statute has so construed to tell that participation in a lawful, peaceful meeting may not be punished regardless of the fact that the sponsor of the meeting is engaged in a legal advocacy which can be function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.565" offset="9177631">That's perfectly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.945" offset="9191111">The clerk in the onset and I quote, "These, referring to First Amendment rights may be abused by using speech or press or assembly in order to incite the violence or crime," but immediately thereafter, Mr. Justice -- the Chief Justice Hughes added."</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.211" offset="9272195">A legislative intervention can find constitutional justification only by dealing with the abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.305" offset="9300616">The rights themselves must not be curtailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.100" offset="9319737">Thus, the constitutional question which De Jonge presented was not whether the advocacy of the Communist Party was an abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.737" offset="9354324">That is whether it created a danger to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.795" offset="9370520">The only relevant question was whether the Act which statute punishment, association with the Party in the conduct of its meeting was an abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.011" offset="9411375">That is to say was self-dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.048" offset="9423600">And so here under the membership clause, the issue was not as to the danger from the advocacy of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.501" offset="9457351">Well, that danger is taken care of by punishing such advocacy under other provisions of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.239" offset="9484309">The issue here is whether the membership of the accused in the organization is itself creative of the danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.658" offset="9522030">Since this is the issue, the membership clause is plainly unconstitutional on its basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.151" offset="9547943">Whereas the Government itself concedes, the membership of a single individual cannot, under any conceivable circumstances, create a clear and present danger of the evil to which the Smith Act would address and attempt at the violent overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.337" offset="9620668">The Government contends in its brief, brief in Noto on re-argument -- in the Scales rather on reargument that it is not the membership of the accused individual alone but the aggregate effect of the membership of all persons in the group, it must be looked to in determining whether a clear and present danger exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.363" offset="9728815">De Jonge disposes of this contention also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.471" offset="9745220">The accused in that case, De Jonge, gave assistance and support to the Communist Party by assisting in the conduct of its meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.772" offset="9782418">But great many other people did likewise, the total effect of their actions would be materially to enhance the influence and prestige of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.855" offset="9822751">But the Court did not test the validity of the statute by measuring the aggregate contribution to the Party's unlawful objective which might be made by all the persons who did or would assist in the conduct of its meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.218" offset="9884296">Instead, the Court asked too much more simple questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.832" offset="9902686">It asked whether performance by De Jonge himself of the Act which the statute punished, was an abuse of his First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.717" offset="9942288">That is to say whether it his assistance, the conduct of a lawful meeting endangered organized Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.171" offset="9976038">Same inquiry must be made here, does the only act which the statute makes an offence in which the indictment charges, the accused membership in the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.709" offset="10030164">Does that create a danger to organize Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.888" offset="10046882">The answer here must be the same as the answer of De Jonge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.067" offset="10059630">The answer is fatal, I submit to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.323" offset="10076662">In arguing the constitutional question, the Government also contends in its brief that the membership clause is essentially a conspiracy statute similar to the one upheld in the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.896" offset="10138937">But in arguing the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, the Government says that in a membership case, it is not necessary to prove and I quote "that the defendant personally conspired to engage in a forbidden advocacy".</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.890" offset="10202885">It is indeed a strange kind of conspiracy statute that authorizes a conviction for conspiracy without proof that the accused conspired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.846" offset="10246771">Certainly, the statute, as written, requires no such proof or it authorizes a conviction notwithstanding that the accused disagrees with the advocacy of forcible overthrow, does not intend by his membership to bring about forcible overthrow and engages in no membership activity of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.054" offset="10331617">The additional agree -- ingredients of intent and activity which as Mr. Davis argued so forcibly this morning in the constitutionally protected activity which the Government proposes to supply in this case, too little to improve the resemblance of the statutes of conspiracy law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.233" offset="10464319">It does not content by his membership to bring about the violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.039" offset="10491486">I've analyzed these ingredients of intent and activity in my brief, the reply brief, and have shown that they can't possibly substitute for what is the gist of the offensive conspiracy and his participation in an agreement to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.583" offset="10553657">But even assuming that evidence of the accused intent and activity, as the Government defines and now today as we define them, the probative of his participation in an illegal agreement, the membership clause could still not be sustained as a conspiracy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.797" offset="10630562">Or in every conspiracy case, the issues as to the existence of a conspiracy and the membership of the accused in it are and must be submitted to the jury, and this is so no matter how compelling the evidence in the particular case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.015" offset="10699421">In a prosecution under the membership clause, however, no such questions are given to the jury, even as the Government rewrites statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.831" offset="10730663">The jury gets no more than the questions of knowledge, intent and activity and membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.830" offset="10762742">Thus, the Government's argument must come down to the proposition that jury finding is against an accused on these four matters, membership, knowledge, intent and activity, raises a conclusive presumption that he was a Party to an agreement to advocate proscribed doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.912" offset="10839019">But as Holt versus United States and a long line of cases holds, the Congress may not legislate such presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.100" offset="10875800">Certainly therefore, the Court may not supply such presumptions by judicial construction of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.165" offset="10907982">The fact is that the Government is trying to do two things in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.142" offset="10923969">On the one hand, it hopes to sustain the constitutionality of the membership clause on conspiracy for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.527" offset="10949465">On the other hand, it wants to avoid the embarrassing necessity of proving a conspiracy in prosecutions under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.785" offset="10982484">These two objectives, unfortunately for the Government, are obviously irreconcilable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.649" offset="11005994">Laborious effort to reconcile them, simply emphasizes the fact that the membership clause is unconstitutional because it violates the clear and present danger doctrine and then imputes guilt solely from innocent association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.401" offset="11072972">To conclude, I believe that Dennis versus United States was wrongly decided and I share the hope expressed by Mr. Justice Black in the dissenting opinion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.508" offset="11129396">But whatever else Dennis may stand for, it does not and cannot support the constitutionality of the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.566" offset="11165654">For all of the majority opinions in that case, emphasize that it was the presence of an active conspiracy that created the danger and Chief Justice Vinson stressed that it was the nature of the defendant's activities and their power to bring about the evil that brought them outside the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.277" offset="11252485">Under the membership clause in contrast, an accused may be convicted without proof that he conspired, and although he has engaged in nothing but peaceable activity and is absolutely powerless to bring about the evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.381" offset="11316851">For these reasons, I submit, membership clause is sufficiently in conflict with the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.226" offset="11504306">First, to take up one of the early questions which grows -- during Mr. Abt's presentation, the question of the -- what the petitioner alleges to be the failure of the Court of Appeals to apply the test of the Yates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.349" offset="11584763">In -- in that connection, our brief and the Court of Appeals in the conclusion of the brief, page 62, the first sentence is, "It has concluded that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury's verdict of guilty in this case within the meaning of Yates."</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.934" offset="11655084">And of course, running through the brief and many other instances in -- in argument by the Government in the Court of Appeals that the evidence here, as far as the Communist Party, the Party's advocacy was concerned yet in fact meets the Yates requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2915.981" offset="11767306">On the other hand, we think it's perfectly clear that the Court of Appeals, when it stated at page 449 which was read earlier, 449 of the record, that the incitement action test, enunciated in Yates has been applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.754" offset="11842435">Stately referred to the -- the member's own action because on the very next page of the opinion, the second -- third last sentence of the opinion, the Court said, "Since the defendant was not indicted for activities, the end result of which, which culminate in action on the part of others, it was not necessary that the evidence of his activity meet the Yates steps."</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.933" offset="11943058">Well, we think that's what the Court referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.986" offset="11955284">It referred to the activities of this particular defendant in -- in the non-applicability of Yates criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.671" offset="12018082">Now, petitioner further suggests that we prove in this case nothing more than we proved in the Yates case on the question of the Party's advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.632" offset="12065938">And he further argues that this Court in Yates held that the evidence there was strikingly insufficient to prove that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.871" offset="12110869">We think he makes -- he -- he makes too much of the Court's comment that the evidence there was strikingly insufficient because this Court, as we read the opinion in the Yates case, specifically held that it was not ruling on the question of whether or not a jury under proper instructions could have found that the Party teaches and advocates in the sense of a call-to-action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.277" offset="12228524">And I think on the contrary, the Court indicates that under proper instructions, the Court could, at least insofar as where the jury could have, insofar as some of the defendants were concerned, possibly have found that the incitement was in the nature of a call-to-action.</text>
