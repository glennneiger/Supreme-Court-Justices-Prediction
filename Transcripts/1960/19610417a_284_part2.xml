            <text syncTime="563.233" offset="2356328">Now, here, in the case of a minority union be in accordance to certain benefits for its people, and as I say this is a wholly unexplored issue, because while there are these Board cases that say that the minority union may bargain for its people provided the employer does not withhold the benefits from its -- from the other -- from the non-union people, the Board in its latest decision on this subject has said, “We are reserving judgment on that problem.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.391" offset="5832913">Now, Mr. Manoli, I think, was sparring or answering questions in which there is a real dilemma, apparently, from the Board's point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.246" offset="5872306">I think Mr. Manoli was indicating that if you have a members only contract with the same terms applicable to everybody, it constitute a kind of exclusive recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.798" offset="5926536">That would be bad if the union were a minority union presumably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.287" offset="5940537">But if they were members only contract with different terms, then as the Board has held, it would be discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.461" offset="5969168">So which ever leg of the dilemma you're on, you're in difficulty and that is not the only dilemma that the Board's presentation presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.122" offset="6011904">Let's turn to the question of good faith doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.698" offset="6026115">The Board cases hold that if an employer does not have a good faith, honest doubt of a union's majority, it is the employer -- but nevertheless asks for a definitive proof of majority, the employer is bargaining in bad faith if it turns up that the union did have a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.999" offset="6111378">Conversely, however, if the employer who has no good faith, doubt and beliefs, honestly that the union has a majority doesn't ask for definitive proof, then as the Board is now urging to this Court,</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.764" offset="6162474">He acted as (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.427" offset="6169057">And if it turns out ultimately that the union didn't have the majority, in that case, the employer is been guilty of the illegal assistance and support which is -- gives rise to that old saw, which many of you, I'm sure, are familiar with, that a foresight were as good as hindsight, we'd be better off by a damp site but that is not the way law ought to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.443" offset="6253171">Now, I want to add one other thing that under the Board's order, and this has not been brought out, if an election were conducted and lost by the union, it couldn't even represented to all members the way the order is phrased, not even its own members.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.396" offset="6432998">That's paragraph 1 (b) on page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.788" offset="6446477">And the remedy part by the way, Mr. Justice Black, bears that out, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.135" offset="6459956">Several times they've repeat that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.055" offset="6467584">So that the union couldn't -- there's a members only representative unless he becomes the majority representative, and I think that's an absurd order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.777" offset="6498513">Now, Mr. Manoli has several times talked about wiping the slate clean that has a marked advantage over any other, these are cliches which the Board has repeated many times, and I ought to understand the kind of thinking that goes into it, but I think these cliches ought not to be a substitute for facts that a particular case ought to be looked at in its own context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.828" offset="6578657">And if in a particular case, as we think here, the union did not get any marked advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.227" offset="6596315">It settled the strike, it got benefits for the workers and the exclusive recognition clause, I think, was just an addendum which, in a practical effect, had no reality and that the October 10th contract, as I said earlier, resulted in a fair uncoerced -- came after a fair and uncoerced majority and that the union should be entitled the bargaining rights.</text>
