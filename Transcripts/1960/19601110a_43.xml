            <label>Mr. Cornelius H. Doherty</label>
            <text syncTime="22.542" offset="193494">Certiorari has been granted in this case to the Circuit Court of Arlington County and is a state court and the appeal, but we do not have the appeal as a matter of right in Virginia and we had to apply it for an appeal, which was denied and certiorari was granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.718" offset="270294">Now the facts in this matter are brief and very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.710" offset="286177">Crandal Mackey who was a member of this Court and had office in the District Columbia for a number of years and was domiciled in Virginia, Arlington County of Virginia, died in March of 1957 and at his death, they found that he had some $263,000 in cash currency, United States currency in a safe deposit box in the District of Columbia in his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.343" offset="416789">Harry R. Thomas, who was the executor named in the will, was appointed his executor by the Circuit Court of Arlington County and thereafter and so the administration was taken out in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.471" offset="465272">It was necessary to do that in order to take care of certain other properties in addition to the $263,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.150" offset="499963">The taxing authorities in the District of Columbia ruled that this $263,000 among the other things that were in were a part of the estate of Crandal Mackey that it was tangible personal property and that it was taxable in the District of Columbia, relying entirely upon the Blodgett case which definitely made that statement and on the basis of that, the executor paid the tax that was due to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.532" offset="621484">There after in making this return in the -- in the Commonwealth of Virginia, they set forth these various facts that it had paid or they had paid the amount of money due on this $263,000 in the District of Columbia, on the ground that it was tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.072" offset="691702">And Virginia ruled that this $263,000 was intangible personal property and not tangible personal property and therefore, they have to pay the tax on that amount of money in the -- in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.739" offset="762337">An application was made by the executor to the Circuit Court of Arlington County on the basis of the law in Virginia which permits you to ask a relief from such an assessment and in that, it was set forth that the charging of this extra tax in Virginia was the taking of -- of property without due process of law, for the simple reason that it was tangible personal property and that Virginia did not have the right to tax it.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.495" offset="881351">Judge Medley, now in the Circuit Court of Arlington County, wrote a memorandum opinion and the judge (Inaudible) stating that it was intangible personal property and assessed the tax as against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.861" offset="954807">Now, the only real question we have here is whether or not, this money is tangible personal property or whether it's intangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.871" offset="998902">I don't believe that there's any question or whatever raised about the law as to where the tax should be paid, in the event that it's intangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.697" offset="1042160">But if its tangible personal property, it should be taxed at the situs, which in this particular case, would be the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.127" offset="1087927">Intangible personal property as referred to in the McKinley's case, the one of the cases cited in both our briefs, makes this statement, "The very different considerations both theoretically -- theoretical and practical, applied in the taxation of intangibles, that is rights which are not related to physical things.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.395" offset="1168906">Such rights are but relationships between persons, natural or corporate, which the law recognizes by attaching to them certain sanctions enforceable in courts, like a certificate of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.892" offset="1218957">No matter what happens to that certificate of stock, you may lose it, someone may steal it, anything may happen and you only -- you have a right then to go to the corporation and say, "Well, that certificate was lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.033" offset="1263470">It was stolen or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.163" offset="1268067">I want a new one."</text>
            <text syncTime="293.513" offset="1277471">Now, -- and in the ordinary course of time, normal course of time, you will get another one and that's true of anything that's be -- just an evidence of a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.212" offset="1316237">You have the right to go into court and to ask the court under those circumstances to give you a judgment or whatever the particular facts may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.369" offset="1352808">Now in the question of tangible personal property, it's contended of course and very definitely by the petitioner that currency, United States currency is a tangible -- is tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.102" offset="1415816">I can't conceive of anything that is more tangible than a $10 bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.777" offset="1438490">It maybe (Inaudible) certificate or gold certificate or maybe for the different bank or from any particular part of the country, once you get that, the normal person never looks at this certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.631" offset="1489899">He doesn't know whether the certificate or what it maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.708" offset="1502229">He knows he can get two $5 bills of that $10 or he can get ten $1s for it, but it's right there and present.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.947" offset="1527202">It's something that can be felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.023" offset="1535457">It's a physical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.843" offset="1542771">You can't lose that or go out and spend it or gamble it away and then go down to the United States Treasury and say, "Well, this is just evidence of a certain obligation of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.582" offset="1589687">We want a new $10 bill or a $100 bill, whatever the thing maybe."</text>
            <text syncTime="376.712" offset="1610271">The thing itself is just what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.977" offset="1627303">The property or physical thing is the $100 or $10 bill that you have in your hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.393" offset="1648933">And when that's gone, everything is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.839" offset="1658755">You have no way in this world to show any evidence to anybody at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.944" offset="1683101">Now the commonwealth contends rather definitely that this is intangible.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.214" offset="1712253">Now, we have this Blodgett case, which is referred to both by the Commonwealth and the petitioner and in that Blodgett case, there were a number of issues that came before this Court, that came out from the Supreme Court of -- of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.487" offset="1785292">There was a question of whether or not, certain stocks and bonds that were in the -- in the State of New York and in the name of the individual who is domiciled in Connecticut and also there was this $287.48 that was in the safe deposit box.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.260" offset="1860420">There's nothing said in there by it was, other than it was a small amount of cash, $287.48. And the -- it was contended in this Court by the State of Connecticut that that was intangible personal property, but the Court said and I'm bringing down on page 6 on my brief down near the end of the citation, but we think that money so definitely fixed and separated in its actual situs from the person of the owner as this was one is tangible property and cannot be distinguished from the paintings and furniture held on the Frick case to be taxable only the jurisdiction where they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.006" offset="2031365">Now this $263,000 isn't like money in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.231" offset="2044322">It would -- $263,000 which put in the bank, then it becomes intangible personal property because all you have then is a right to insist that that bank pay over some time $263,000, but this money was actually in the possession and under the control of Crandal Mackey until he died and the District of Columbia, with their assessor or the Register of Wills, went up there to open the safe deposit box and it was opened here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.105" offset="2163754">The Commonwealth says this in its brief on page 7, "The language of this Court, speaking about the Blodgett case, quoted immediately above, constitutes the sole support of the petitioner's position in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.061" offset="2227597">Were it not for this language, the instant case would not have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.979" offset="2243271">It would therefore, seem appropriate who analyzes isolated paragraph in as much detail as it its mere contents will permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.657" offset="2277961">Now, there was no -- any reason to say anything more than that and it set forth this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.762" offset="2302412">It was one issue that would be for this Court and the question was, was this money in the safe deposit box?</text>
            <text syncTime="555.698" offset="2326131">This cash whatever it maybe, in the safe deposit box tangible personal property or intangible personal property?</text>
            <text syncTime="562.889" offset="2354970">They just say its money.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.362" offset="2360822">That's the way we always look at it, it's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.606" offset="2369808">There's nothing else there -- as a -- it's the same as a diamond ring or a watch and under those circumstances, it cannot be conceived to be as the Commonwealth contents, intangible personal property.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.473" offset="2441279">May I ask you that the (Inaudible) that the (Inaudible) certificate is more or less, the thing itself than they still (Inaudible)?</text>

            <label>Mr. Cornelius H. Doherty</label>
            <text syncTime="596.831" offset="2490702">I -- I would say, they're both the same thing as the Court -- as this Court said in the Norwich case which I referred to on page 12 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.729" offset="2530304">It says, gold certificates, this is a case where this man had some $106,000 when the United States went off the gold standard and he asked for a $106,000 in gold pieces which they refused to give it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.303" offset="2620583">They gave him a $106,000 in just ordinary bills and he filed a suit in the Court of Claims the balance with $60,000 or $70,000 which was the increased value of that gold from the time that he'd originally gotten it or from the time that the -- this particular certificate was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.933" offset="2695084">And the Court said this -- this Court, "Gold certificates under this legislation were required to be issued in denominations of dollars and called to the payment of dollars."</text>
            <text syncTime="660.743" offset="2746389">These gold certificates were currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.829" offset="2758719">They were not less sold because the specified numbers of dollars were payable in gold coin or the coinage of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.532" offset="2797484">The in currency and constitute legal tender, it is entirely inadmissible to regard the gold certificates as warehouse receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.121" offset="2847848">They were not contracts where a shortened of -- of gold as a commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.419" offset="2869060">They called for dollars not bullion.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.507" offset="2881390">So that -- the main thing when you -- to show that they're intangible, you must go back to same old theory and that is, is it evidence of anything?</text>
            <text syncTime="704.660" offset="2922036">The only thing is it's evidence of just what it is, it's a physical thing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.907" offset="2938964">It isn't any evidence of anything else rather than the fact that you can take that $10 or $100 and go out and do whatever you want with it, but when it's gone, it's gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.486" offset="2973341">You lose it, it's gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.149" offset="2979924">If it's stolen, it's gone, unless you're able to find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.152" offset="2987969">There's no way of identifying that thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.553" offset="2997582">Now, the Commonwealth relies greatly upon Justice Stone's concurring opinion in the –</text>

            <text syncTime="735.866" offset="3046797">Pearson case, yes, sir and thank you, Justice Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.635" offset="3065919">In that case, I don't see why Justice Stone was so perturbed about this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.995" offset="3095385">He had a different point of view I'm certain, than some of the other justices that sat in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.314" offset="3124642">Now, Justice Stone was in the Blodgett case and that -- there was a dissenting opinion in the Blodgett case which said very definitely that this money in the safe deposit box was tangible personal property and was taxable in New York and not in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.358" offset="3184828">Now, in this particular case, in Pearson case, this was the -- where a man in Oregon had a deal of some kind for the purpose of making a trust for his certain members of his family, was dealing with Illinois Trust Company and that Illinois Trust Company was a -- a large bank in the city of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.059" offset="3275630">And he had turned over -- over a period of time and certain moneys and certain stock and all these various things that were to be used by them or to be invested as they saw fit, for certain purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.955" offset="3323173">He had a certain amount of money on him $68,000, as I remember, this $450,000 in -- on deposit in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.589" offset="3353684">And he directed among other things that this trust company was to sell all his stocks of various parts also that he would have eventually get $450,000 in cash and that he was to -- they would've put those into ordinary dollars, gold certificates or currency, whatever it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.766" offset="3438425">Now, whether that bank was supposed to hold that money or not, there's nothing to indicate that, whether it was to be taken in as a part of their assets in the bank and held there.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.673" offset="3478026">It was -- as I look at, there was nothing very definitive to -- to say that that $450,000 should be kept that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.209" offset="3504253">But nevertheless, he went on, the bank went on then and bought various other stocks and investments on that $450,000 and thereafter he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.474" offset="3549288">Now, we have the case where this money is -- is away from the individual, He's -- he's divested his -- any right that he has to it -- that is from a physical right.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.976" offset="3591293">He can't go there and just say I want this.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.712" offset="3602265">The only thing he can do is say, Well, I -- I'm going to change my mind, if he could, before this trust was really formed and I want my money back and they'll send him a check for the amount of money that was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.173" offset="3644061">Under those circumstances, he had just the right, he has something to show that this money is there in this bank in Chicago and he can demand it and then get it back at a certain time or up to -- he divests himself of that, but here we don't have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.524" offset="3701426">We have certainly the money actually, in the possession of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.793" offset="3718562">It's just the same as a man who puts money in the bank, it commingles with something else, you have a right to that, you can sign a check and do whatever you want and if you lose your bank, well, you can call upon them immediately and they'll send you another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.102" offset="3771747">Now, in this statement of Justice Stone, the Court didn't go along with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.460" offset="3817200">Justice Frankfurter did go along to a certain extent with what Justice Stone did say, but he must have had an entirely different view about dollars and I don't think he was talking about dollars because he certainly would have said something in the Blodgett case if he wasn't in concurrence with the statement that was in there that this was tangible personal property and taxable where it was in the safe deposit box, but in this Pearson versus McGraw, the court -- this Court said that, "Therefore, we need not consider the nature of the Federal Reserve notes for in that posture of the case, their taxability as such and an isolation from the whole transaction is not an issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.215" offset="7380198">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.563" offset="7393573">As indicated in the brief on behalf of respondent, the Commonwealth of Virginia also relies to a significant degree upon this Court's decision in Blodgett versus Silberman, for the support of the Commonwealth's position that there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which prohibits Virginia from imposing an inheritance tax upon paper money owned by a Virginia citizen who was domiciled in Virginia at the time of his death, but which was kept in a safe deposit box in a bank in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.461" offset="7533171">Naturally, we would prefer that the terminal paragraph of this Court's decision -- decision in Blodgett, had not been written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.756" offset="7566399">Nevertheless, we feel that so much of the language which this Court used in disposing of the principal question in that case, is appropriate to the specific situation presented in this case that we have stressed it in the opening pages of our brief particularly pages 5 and 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.468" offset="7649259">In the Blodgett case, this Court reaffirmed the firmly precedented constitutional principle that intangible personal property belonging to a decedent domiciled in a particular state, could be taxed by that state even though the evidences of that intangible property were located outside of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.294" offset="7740583">The court then proceeded to consider whether or not, two elements of the Hershey State, under consideration in that case, constituted tangible personal property subject to the Frick rule or intangible personal property subject to the rule which it had just annunciated or which had just reaffirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.955" offset="7819160">Insofar as the Hershey's interest in a partnership in New York was concerned, both the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut and this Court, held that that was intangible personal property subject to taxation by Connecticut, the state in which Mr. Hershey was domiciled at the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.155" offset="7900035">However, the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut had held that United States Government bonds and treasury certificates of indebtedness constituted tangible personal property and since there was United States bonds and treasury certificates of indebtedness were situated in a safe deposit box in a bank in New York and had never been in the State of Connecticut, they were taxable only in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.226" offset="8020302">The Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut admitted in its decision that essentially the bonds and treasury certificates of indebtedness were choses in action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.395" offset="8064920">However, as stated on page 5 of our brief, the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut said that since these bonds are negotiable, since they pass from hand to hand and since under the laws of some states, they can be the subject of attachment and they maybe the subject of a jurisdiction of certain state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.289" offset="8152482">They should be held to fall under the Frick rule and not to be different from the furniture, the paintings, the rugs and the firm implements under consideration in the Frick case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.754" offset="9830379">But I do feel that any contention that paper money is something real and tangible because it is kept in a locked box misconceives the Blodgett doctrine entirely because the bonds and treasury certificates of indebtedness in Blodgett were also kept in a locked box in New York and had never been in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.123" offset="9939884">Notwithstanding, the Court held that they were intangible personal property and that they were subject to taxation by Connecticut.</text>

            <text syncTime="2565.513" offset="10365471">We also of course, rely upon the observations of Mr. Justice Stone in Pearson versus McGraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.668" offset="10402043">We think that there was really no consideration of the nature of bank notes in Blodgett versus Silberman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.414" offset="10437047">The Court said, only that the money, the $287.48 under consideration in that case, was comprised of bank notes and coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.154" offset="10476022">Thereafter, it noted the arguments which had been made by Connecticut in which it was argued that -- that the money on the consideration there was not like coin or treasure in the vault, but was like loose change, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.981" offset="10535267">And then the Court said, “We think that money so definitely fixed and separated in its actual situs from the person, the owner is tangible personal property."</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.166" offset="10568077">There was no mention made of bank notes after initially saying that the small amount of money under consideration in that case, was comprised of bank notes and coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.328" offset="10612694">Thereafter, we submit, the Court considered it all as money without giving consideration to the statutory character of paper money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.535" offset="10653550">And we feel that this Court's observations in Blodgett versus Silberman concerning US bonds and treasury certificates of indebtedness are precisely on point with United States paper money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.769" offset="10706422">At the bottom of page 5 of our brief, we set out what this Court said about U.S. bonds and the treasury certificates of indebtedness, beginning with italicized language at the bottom of that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.669" offset="10746023">The Court said, “We think bonds are not thus distinguishable from other choses in action,” that is simply because they passed them from hand to hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.424" offset="10777057">It is not enough to show that the written or printed evidence of ownership, made by the law of the state in which they are physically present, be permitted to be taken in execution or dealt with as reaching that of in which they are evidenced even without the presence of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.688" offset="10834108">While bonds often are so treated, they are nevertheless in their essence only evidences of debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.302" offset="10864619">Then it went on the discussion of Union Refrigerator Transit Company case, shows what this Court meant in the Frick case, in holding that personal property in the form of paintings and furniture, having an actual situs in one state, could not be subjected to the transfer tax in another state and emphasizes the inference that it did not apply to anything having as its essence and indebtedness or a chose in action and could not apply to property in the form of specialties or bonds or other written evidences of indebtedness whether governmental or otherwise, even though they pass from hand to hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.627" offset="11033893">The analogy between furniture and bonds cannot be complete, because bonds are representative only and are not the thing represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.633" offset="11065866">They are at most choses in action and intangibles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.649" offset="11081958">We think that is equally true in view of the statutory provisions set out on pages 12 and 13, showing the character of silver certificates, United States notes and Federal Reserve notes that every observation made by the Court in Blodgett versus Silberman with respect to United States Government bonds and treasury certificates of indebtedness, is equally applicable to paper money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.384" offset="11180910">There is no question, I might point out that the $450,000 worth of Federal Reserve notes under consideration in Pearson versus McGraw was nothing but paper money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.510" offset="11225422">It does not appeal from this Court's opinion that that is true, but in the case as it was heard in the Supreme Court of Oregon, the opinion in that case used this language in discussing of whether or not, Oregon protects the $450,000 worth of Federal Reserve notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.803" offset="11298565">It said in 86 Pacific 2nd at 427, “The layman's word for Federal Reserve notes is paper money."</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.096" offset="11339734">So in Pearson versus McGraw, this Court had on the consideration whether or not, $450,000 worth of paper money which had never been in Oregon could be taxed by Oregon and this Court held but it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.153" offset="11403995">The basis of the decision in that case was that the $450,000 in paper money was brought an indistinguishable step in a series of steps amounting to a transfer of intangibles in contemplation of debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.112" offset="11459793">Mr. Justice Stone in an opinion in which Mr. Justice Frankfurter concurred, took the view that there was nothing in the Constitution which forbad Oregon to impose an inheritance tax upon the gift of paper money even though the paper money was in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.962" offset="11539205">And Mr. Justice Stone has also pointed out that no reason had been given even in Blodgett versus Silberman for any different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.208" offset="11584240">And I think that that is definitely an unarguable statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.387" offset="11612871">All that was said in Blodgett versus Silberman was that money was tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.182" offset="11636067">There was no consideration given to the nature of bank notes nor was there any reason supportive of the Court's holding that the money under consideration was tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.293" offset="11700537">The |Court in Blodgett said, “We think that money so definitely fixed and separate from the domicile of decedent should be considered tangible personal property like the paintings and furniture like in Frick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.766" offset="11758425">" And in his opinion in Pearson versus McGraw, Mr. Justice Stone said and we have set it out on pages 10 and 11 -- in the middle of page 11, “As I am of the opinion that there is nothing in the Constitution to compel a state, to treat Federal Reserve notes for tax purposes as chattels were treated in Frick versus Pennsylvania and as no reason has been advanced even in Blodgett versus Silberman for a different view, the judgment should I think, be reversed rest upon this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.224" offset="11900217">I think -- and so that the Commonwealth has stated in his brief that perhaps the nub of this case is a manner of degree into which category shall paper money fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.353" offset="11948805">Shall it be deemed to be more similar to United States bonds, treasury certificates of indebtedness and other choses in action or intangibles or shall it be classified for purposes of constitutional inheritance taxation as rugs or furniture or automobiles as what's under consideration in Frick case.</text>
