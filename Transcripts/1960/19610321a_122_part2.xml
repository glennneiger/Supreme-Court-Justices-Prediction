            <text syncTime="3.625" offset="117844">Mr. Chief Justice, just prior to the recess Mr. -- a question was asked with regard directly to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.524" offset="165491">And I think the Government's answer without any question is that the man has immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.099" offset="191718">And I think this is related to the question that the Chief Justice asked me and I like to explain it in these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.346" offset="228707">Take this example, if we take Piemonte in this particular context and he was at the point where he was granted immunity by the court and then he is now taken in front of a grand jury, the same grand jury that day or the next day as happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.234" offset="304358">And the very first question that's -- I think this is a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.852" offset="322748">The very first question is, “Now, did you rob the First National Bank?”</text>
            <text syncTime="63.144" offset="355976">I think the answer is yes, he has immunity in regard to that transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.205" offset="392234">And I say it for the same reason that I answered the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.543" offset="413550">And that this -- the prosecutor has decided quite clearly in that case that this is relevant to the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.238" offset="456286">I do not think that the witness has to decide or should decide what is relevant to the narcotics inquiry if the prosecutor chooses to open up this avenue and that's where we're going.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.716" offset="514278">And in this connection of course, it's true the prosecutor and he usually told to be very careful because Congress has continually told the prosecutors, "Don't give anybody an immunity bath," as they term it.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.386" offset="588884">But I say very clearly without any question, that if the prosecutor in this grand jury asked this question, he does get immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.497" offset="625351">Now, this doesn't always have to happen in this sequence and it's only when you get away from this particular -- the particular facts here that I come to another problem namely --</text>

            <text syncTime="150.131" offset="703927">Apparently, that the robbing in the First National Bank is well about as far away from a narcotic bracket and as you would expect almost any other crime to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.023" offset="755440">Now, does that mean that -- that any question that he asks would -- would confer immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.703" offset="8710144">And if anything, the colloquy about the question of whether or not he should have been granted of privilege or not, I think all it goes to is the fact that the Government bought more it had to buy, if anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.015" offset="8931453">The Government's view on the -- on the indictment is that this is irrelevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.763" offset="8966457">First of all, this petitioner was not a defendant in a case at the time of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.912" offset="8994983">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.549" offset="9001566">There's an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.680" offset="9010134">This -- this petitioner was not a target of this grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.111" offset="9023822">This comes nowhere near the type of case where we get concerned about who's being interrogated in front of a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.541" offset="9065514">In the reply brief, the petitioner posed the question as if he had stood mute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.493" offset="9089337">And that that was all that was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.601" offset="9101772">Now, without getting into the vagaries of grand juries and why they indict and why they do not indict, if anything -- if anything, we think -- and this goes to the whole scope of all legal questions including even fairness, if anything, they all arise if at all in the indictment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.584" offset="9189752">And this is true even under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.330" offset="9204694">If we read the statute in its narrowest terms, wit, that the Government had merely an election and I think that's much more narrowly than the statute should be read in election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.467" offset="9253282">The statute specifically says and from the last clause of it, “No witness shall be exempt under this section from prosecution for perjury or contempt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.515" offset="9305422">We're clear, they would end this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.159" offset="9315976">This is not to say that there may not be problems in another case, as with this Court has had other cases like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.296" offset="9352547">And one of them that come to mind is Regan versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.998" offset="9367385">A serious problem or much more serious than this, because in that case, the man had waived immunity, so that he clearly was going to be not only indicted, but could be held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.209" offset="9424227">So the clear problem in this Court very clearly understood, those problems can arrive and they'll be handled in another case, if they are problems at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.961" offset="9463202">We do not say that this is a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.636" offset="9473964">This is a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.592" offset="9481697">This man was not a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.377" offset="9488906">If this man were as the petitioner so places him, he certainly would've been entitled to a lawyer right then and there, in the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.098" offset="9523806">And I have yet -- I do not believe this Court has ever felt that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.187" offset="9544077">Certainly, there's no difference in the calling it a witness statute and the Fifth Amendment uses the same term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.884" offset="9574902">I mean, we're not -- we're not talking about words then in those -- in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.460" offset="9593187">I cannot see how and I know of no case, how a subsequent proceeding entirely unrelated, because it's a crime in narcotics and the other, this case is about disobeying a court order, how it can retroactively knockout and that's the way I read it, “Knockout a judgment that a -- a court has made without more than that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.597" offset="9709798">I know of no case that would so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.426" offset="9721083">It is the reverse argument that was made in Reina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.345" offset="9740727">Reina wanted a pardon for what he'd already -- and this is just the other way around that he wants something that he may not be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.710" offset="9774164">But if he were even, that would be a problem which clearly should be raised in the indictment case in whatever it's worth it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.749" offset="9806346">The facts in this case, it will not come because the indictment was dismissed by the Government because the witness was unable to identify Piemonte at that time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.674" offset="9870085">And that's clearly disclosed on the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2463.364" offset="9956812">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.438" offset="9977083">I can think there are only two propositions that would be appropriate to the reply that I here, undertake, both in the view of the rather limited scope of what's been brought out on the oral argument and in view of the rather limited remaining time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.024" offset="10039463">I should suggest Your Honors that when we speak of whether immunity will result in a different -- in -- in varying situations, we get into rather a dangerous area of comparing equitable immunity in a situation in which a man would have every right to come up and urge to a trial court, "Good heavens, look what happened to me down there and just generally, equitably, I ought not to be prosecuted."</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.127" offset="10131832">On the one hand, with statutory immunity, the absolute, complete uncompromising bar on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.613" offset="10157850">Now, equitable immunity will indeed arise as counsel as in -- as intimated from reliance upon the Government in his representations in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.622" offset="10197870">However, a failure to perceive on the basis of equitable immunity will not I believe, serve as a basis for a contempt order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.389" offset="10236949">The statutory immunity of the provisions I think, are plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.701" offset="10254190">Now, I would take some issue with the proposition that the court grants immunity in these situations, just as the Isaac case does and just as counsel here did not seem to urge with any great vigor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.625" offset="10297866">What the court does in these circumstances, is to evaluate the petition and then to compel the witness to surrender his constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.448" offset="10333184">It does not however, grant him immunity from prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.661" offset="10346036">The grant is statutory and close from the witnesses testifying, with reference to any subject, matter or thing concerning which he has first claimed his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and then thereafter, testifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.073" offset="10407685">The most significant words in the statute as I read it, are having first claimed his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination or words of that genre.</text>
