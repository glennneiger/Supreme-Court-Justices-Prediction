            <text syncTime="48.977" offset="299238">In this case, an indictment was returned against the petitioner Burton N. Pugach in the State of New York, Bronx County, charging him with a crime of maiming, assault, burglary and conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.786" offset="382516">Another indictment was returned against him charging him with possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.189" offset="420133">Pugach was an attorney and a member of the New York Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.222" offset="456286">His office telephone had been tapped by the police of the State of New York, pursuant to an order obtained from the Supreme Court of the State of New York for a period of approximately four and a half months in the course of which, this Court must realize that any number of confidential communication were intercepted by the police and made use for whatever purpose they saw fit for a sedition where he had other associates in his office whose wires were also tapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.051" offset="611558">So that this is the type of the case that reminds us that the right of privacy slowly or surely being eroded insofar as the protection of 605 is concerned.</text>

            <label>Mr. George J. Todaro</label>
            <text syncTime="148.566" offset="697657">Yes, Your Honor I might off the record -- say he's a little -- not sound mentally but that is no -- nothing to with the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.315" offset="744678">Now, he brought an Action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York wherein he sought and injunction to restraint the District Attorney of Bronx County and the police commissioner of the State of New York from using and divulging wire-tapped evidence at his trial in the county court on both indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.273" offset="876440">The District Attorney moved to dismiss this complaint for failure to state a cause of action and that motion was granted by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.609" offset="929834">An appeal was taken and a motion was made in the Court of Appeals for a preliminary -- for an injunction pendente lite to keep the status quo until the full bench had an opportunity to pass on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.107" offset="999842">The Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary state and if I maybe permitted, to quote from Judge Medina who over Judge Waterman grant at this stay stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.369" offset="1080822">Pugach's argument is that Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act makes it a federal crime to tap a telephone and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect of such intercepted communication that the defendants or their agents are about to commit this federal crime by further divulging and offering the wiretap in evidence at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.388" offset="1188968">The Supreme Court has in effect held the United States versus Benanti, 1957 that the constitutional and legislative authorization of wiretap on the State of New York is illegal and void, that if the evidence as we see at the trial and Pugach is convicted, he will be wholly without remedy, since under the Schwartz versus Texas, 1952, 344 U.S. 199, which is still in effect, the evidence will be admissible under the New York rules of evidence, even though illegally obtained and his conviction will not be revised.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.557" offset="1349569">He also claimed that the result to such violation of federal law would deprive him of his legal license and his license to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.435" offset="1381125">Pugach argued that unless we grant the injunctive relief, he prays that defendant on arrangement will go ahead and violate the federal statute with impunity, shielding themselves beyond the -- behind the constitutional legislative scheme of the State of New York that has been held by the Supreme Court to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.832" offset="1466702">This is a probable argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.425" offset="1477047">Now, we have been unable to find the satisfactory answer and I like to quote from Judge Waterman who also joined in -- in granting this temporary stay, who stated, “Although it is (Inaudible) that the federal court should so presume to interfere with the only progress of the administration of justice in the state courts by issuing state order, the present situation is improbable, too."</text>
            <text syncTime="370.496" offset="1585403">It goes against the grain (Inaudible) and await the violation of a federal statute one knows is to be violated, while also known that the only if reversed the United States may have after the violation, is to proceed on 501 against the conscientious police office, was only obeying orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.495" offset="1709328">He modified it because as he said that, he could not concede that his brethren in the State Bar would condone and permit the commission of a crime in the very parts of law where crimes have been trapped and for -- that was one of his basic reasons for agreeing to concur with the rest of the bench.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.705" offset="1822177">No, he concurred in that opinion if Your Honor please because he felt that the -- that the judges of the State of New York would not tolerate the violation of Section 605 in the Court where the crime was being charged, but in this, I'm sorry to say, he has been disappointed because I'd be out of this, still signing orders in New York as though tapping wires in New York.</text>

            <label>Mr. George J. Todaro</label>
            <text syncTime="498.535" offset="2097507">Yes Your Honor and Judge Welinz, I think it was, refused to permit wiretap evidence in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.067" offset="2127600">He felt that he is a judge what is bound to obey the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the United States, and he would not permit it, but that isn't the situation here because Bronx County is still claims that they have no right to do so and they are still doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.128" offset="2199907">They are still tapping wire everyday and many judges are still signing wiretap warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.155" offset="2231986">Of course, it might be of interest to note that recently even after the Veriano case by our Court of Appeals and the Brody case by a Court of Appeals, one of the judges, Judge Davidson into the court at general session, refused to sign the wiretap order.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.157" offset="2296038">And I think, I -- if Your Honor would bear with me, I'd be quoted, Judge Davidson in refusing to sign the wiretap order that was requested of him by the District Attorney Hogan of New York County stated, “Lawlessness by the police and the District Attorney who has sworn to uphold and enforce the law will not aid in the enforcement of the criminal law, nor will it heighten the respect of our citizen for our law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="591.492" offset="2469386">He and another judge Huster, have taken similar position, but they are in the very, very small minority because wiretap orders have been signed almost daily and District Attorney feels that it's a necessary adjunct for law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.140" offset="2567920">Well, I say Your Honors that if it is a necessary adjunct to law enforcement, they should proceed to go to Congress of the Unites States to seek the relief that they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.728" offset="2614314">Now Congress of the United States represents all of the people and when 605 states no person shall intercept the communication, it means exactly that and then there's no exception to the State of New York or to a police officer of the State of New York or to a judge at the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.374" offset="2680874">It applies to all of the people of the United States and no one is exempt or excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.187" offset="2728103">Well now, may I go into this most amenable question and the question before this Court whether this Court will indicate the supremacy of an Act that Congress which is declared to be the supreme or paramount law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.474" offset="2821308">It revolved as so shall 605 be (Inaudible) entered because it's being violated everyday, there's only been one prosecution throughout the existence of 605 and that was in the Greece case.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.034" offset="2883480">Although it's common knowledge that it is being violated everyday, it's the question whether 605 shall be decently entered for all time to beat or it shall be given new vitality, new vigor and be resuscitated as a plot -- as it properly should as a law of the United State that should be respected and obeyed until the Congress of the United States modifies or changes that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.028" offset="2991522">And in connection with this in the first Nardone case and this question came up before this Court, this Court held 302 U.S. at page 382, "We nevertheless -- nevertheless face the fact that the plain weight of Section 605 forbids anyone unless authorized by the sender to intercept the telephone message and directs in equally clear language that not person shall divulge the message to any person to recite the contents of the message and testimony before the Court is to divulge the message.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.922" offset="3147107">The Act forbids such testimony."</text>
            <text syncTime="763.975" offset="3159228">Now, I recall in the Benanti case, I was the attorney who had the Benanti case and I had to prove (Inaudible) the Benanti before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.088" offset="3195695">This Court even went so far to say that a divulsion to a judge is a violation of the law or divulgence to anyone is a violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.616" offset="3237804">Of course, I might say that in Benanti I am digressing a bit, this Court did not answer the question of whether the tapping was a violation of law or tapping and divulging because in the Benanti case, both were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.036" offset="3311470">Now, it seems to me, Your Honor that to give real vitality and meaning to 605, what Congress of the United States intended was that no person shall intercept the communication and as soon as some strong language is used, we will have obedience to 605 until modified by the Congress of the United States, thus so fits, it so feels fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.235" offset="3420348">Now, here the situation is that we are trying prevent the further violation of 605 by divulgence in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.755" offset="3466428">Although there was a tap in this case for four and a half months, although some of that testimony was adduced before the grand juries, I -- we understand to the present part, I say that what Congress really intended was that the tap to be stopped because a tap that doesn't sit by either by presumed amusement, hours after hours, listening to conversation, he doesn't do it for his personal amusement, he does it for a definite purpose either to divulge to a superior, either to make use of that -- of -- of the overheard conversation for his own personal reason and the statute says that the person shall not make use of the information gathered and that's what prompted the second Nardone case where the Court abused the time to fruit of the poison street.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.732" offset="5746291">They would be violating the law by making use of it, but if unless they're caught, they'd still be on (Inaudible) a thief is only a thief after he's caught more or less.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.851" offset="5882755">Another thing I'd like to pint out is that under the Benanti case and I would like to get that cleared up, we -- we the -- the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction of Benanti even though we developed the wiretap during the trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.343" offset="5972720">And Judge Medina who wrote that opinion affirming the lower court, stated as follows, "Despite the warrant issues by the New York State Court, pursuant to the New York law, we have no alternative other than to hold that by tapping the wires, intercept of the communication made by the appellant and divulging at the trial what they have -- had overheard, the New York police officer violated the federal statute and cites Nardone and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.357" offset="6100825">Section 605 of 47 U.S.C.A. is too explicit to warrant any other evidence and Weiss -- and the Weiss case made its term applicable to interesting communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.564" offset="6153592">The section provides no person not being authorized by the said assembly shall intercept any communication that divulged or published the existent content substantive (Inaudible) the meaning of such intercepted communication to any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.442" offset="6225168">This ruling or this ruling of the Circuit Court was not disturbed by the Supreme Court -- by this Court when Benanti came up on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.751" offset="6334360">And I might say that the Solicitor General of the United States, when we argued that case, devoted most of this time in attempting to sustain the right of the State of New York to legislate permitting wiretaps, because under the law as to the State of New York, wiretapping is permitted, pursuant to a constitutional provision of the sate and pursue -- pursuant to the code of criminal procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.089" offset="6459747">Yes, yes, Your Honor and this is what this Court said, "Respondent does not urge that constitutionally speaking Congress is without power to forbid such wiretapping even on the face of a conflicting state law Weiss versus US where the argument that Congress has not exercised this power and that Section 605, being general in its term, should not be deemed to operate to prevent the State from authorizing wiretapping in the exercise of its legitimate police function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.030" offset="6611466">However, we read the Federal Communications Act and Section 605 in particular to the contrary, both for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.983" offset="6659323">The Federal Communication Act is the comprehensive scheme for the regulation of interstate communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.481" offset="6689311">In order to safeguard those interest protected under Section 605, that portion of the statute pertinent to this case, applies both to intrastate than interstate communication," Weiss versus United States, supra.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.886" offset="6750960">The natural result of respondent's argument is that both interstate and intrastate communication would be removed from the statute for protection because as this Court noted in Weiss, the interceptor cannot be same between the two and will listen to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.604" offset="6821804">Congress did not intend to place the protection so plainly guaranteed in Section 605 in such a vulnerable position.</text>
