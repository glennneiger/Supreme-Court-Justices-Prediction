            <text syncTime="22.880" offset="194853">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.009" offset="227453">This is an appeal from a decision of a three-judge court for the District for the First District, relating to the Sunday Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, so called.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.504" offset="289416">The proceeding was held in the District Court for Massachusetts as a result of a hearing and a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.410" offset="341034">A decision of the court was rendered by two members of the court and a majority -- a majority decision entered by the court and a minority opinion by Justice McCarthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.748" offset="406340">As far as the proceedings before the District Court are concerned, a complaint was filed by the petitioners alleging, in effect, that they conducted a Kosher Super Market in Springfield, Massachusetts, at which Kosher Super Market, they sold foods which had been approved by the rabbi, that they sold those foods for purposes of satisfying the religious requirements of the various customers of that particular store, that they held their store closed from sundown on Friday through Saturday and that they opened their store on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.017" offset="603408">Basically, the violation that was involved here related to the sale of foods by that Kosher Super Market on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.832" offset="650742">There were three cases initially in the Massachusetts Supreme Court against the manager of that market and as a result of convictions in those three cases, a declaratory judgment proceeding was brought in the District Court prior referred to.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.657" offset="730049">Do you think the fact that it was a Kosher market, rather than some other market and relevant here to the issues?</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_h_elcock_jr" startTime="164.231" stopTime="317.318">
            <label>Mr. Joseph H. Elcock, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="164.231" offset="760247">To us, Your Honor, it has no relevance in the sense that this is a super market.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.737" offset="782294">It sells-- the evidence will show that it sells foods which were approved by the rabbi.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.871" offset="802879">It will also show that they sold foods which were not necessarily kosher foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.658" offset="825971">To that extent, they went beyond what may well have been the requirements of a Kosher Super Market in the sense of selling only foods.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.104" offset="867767">It will become significant from the point of view of the complainants, Your Honor, in the sense that they claim that in order to satisfy the religious requirements of their customers, it is necessary that they be able to make sales on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.015" offset="935476">To that extent, from their viewpoint, it does have a religious connotation in the sense that they claim that not by being prohibited from making any sales on Sunday that the religious rights of their customers are disturbed, as well as the religious rights of the officers and directors and stockholders of this particular corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.545" offset="1033592">There were allegations and it has been admitted that the stockholders, the directors and the officers of this Crown Kosher Super Market were, in effect, obliged by the tenants of their religious beliefs to remain closed during those hours that I have referred to, that is from Sundown on Friday night through Saturday, through, at least until sundown on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.428" offset="1145083">Thereafter, of course, they would be allowed to open.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.639" offset="1153964">So, we would say that, from our viewpoint, Your Honor, it is not significant or should not be significant that there is a religious connotation to at least some of the sales made by the Crown Kosher Super Market.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.906" offset="1214986">On the other hand Your Honor, as I say, the gravamen of the action would be, as far as I'm able to determine from the complaint, that the very fact that the Massachusetts statute here, obliges them to close on Sunday, interferes with their religious rights and they go one step further because the Massachusetts statutes, as they alleged and which, of course, is the knife from my viewpoint, because the Massachusetts statute is predicated upon what they believed to be a religious ground, they then say that under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution that their religious rights are disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.304" offset="1368586">Of course, Your Honor, you're going --</text>

            <text syncTime="317.318" offset="1372662">Do you make a distinction between -- between religious rights and -- and religious observance?</text>
            <text syncTime="328.489" offset="1417279">The -- the point I make is -- is this, I am not quite clear how they allege that keeping open on Sunday interfered with their religious observances.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.910" offset="1475062">As I understand it, Your Honor, it would be on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.287" offset="1492511">Ordinary markets in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may open six days a week and they are required to close on -- on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.528" offset="1525530">They contend that they are obliged to close on Sunday because of the statute and because of their religious beliefs they are obliged to close on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.551" offset="1565550">Thus it is argued, they are obliged to remain closed two days in the week, whereas, the ordinary market in a similar position, would be allowed to -- would be obliged to be closed on only one day of the week.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.649" offset="1653948">Well, I believe that is the point that they are taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.637" offset="1661889">That there is an economic loss to them and that they are obliged to forego the right to carry-on business on one extra day of the week and because of the fact that they forego it to their religious beliefs and because of the fact that the Sunday closing, according to them, is similarly predicated upon religious grounds, they then say that a religious law has put them in a position where their economic rights are disturbed.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.625" offset="1805876">They would say that because of the preference that may be given to persons who are not of their persuasion would put them in a position where others might feel that they shouldn't perhaps, be bound by the tenants of that religious state.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.908" offset="1907022">Of course, as we will point out in the course of our argument Your Honor, the Commonwealth imposes limitations on Sunday and for no state action whatsoever, are these people closed on Saturday, nor are they closed on Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.390" offset="1960939">So that, we would say that everyone is subject to the Sunday Law and assuming the Sunday Law is a valid one, the mere fact that it would have an indirect effect upon their religious rights would not in and of itself, make the Sunday Law invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.281" offset="2020498">There are many instances, I would assume that would more or less, indicate that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.932" offset="2039097">We have certainly requirements that students, for example, shall attend schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.797" offset="2066578">We have obligations upon the parents to support schools, say to support the public schools yet I don't think there's any doubt that some parents, perhaps because of their religious beliefs, also would support another school system such as a parochial school and to the extent that there is an economic detriment on one religious group or another, that per se, Your Honors, we feel would not be a sufficient ground under these particular circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.536" offset="2321533">We do have a statute of Massachusetts that requires closing on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.722" offset="2338252">And one of the basic arguments of the complainants in this case, is that that statute is a religious one and the Fourteenth Amendment would impose an obligation on the States to refrain from passing any statute of that nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.061" offset="3343653">It will also appear that in the New York courts, it had been determined that although initially, this statute in New York may have had a religious significance that as a result of the various amendments to it, it no longer was for the purpose of preferring one religion to another, establishing one religion or what have you, as far as religious base is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.446" offset="3445112">And the mere fact that the word, "Sabbath" was in there, as far as I'm able to determine, was not persuasive upon this Court of the fact that the Constitutional rights of the parties in that particular case had been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.428" offset="3509060">Now, we have, Your Honor, a statute almost identical with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.225" offset="3524315">I cannot say, word-for-word it is identical, but it is highly similar in the sense that instead of talking about the Sabbath, Massachusetts talks about the word, “Lords day.”</text>
            <text syncTime="866.583" offset="3569664">We have all kinds of -- of limitations and exceptions in our statute, just as they did right here in -- in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.970" offset="3839248">Basically, we are here, dealing with a statute which provides for one day of rest out of seven, something like a wages and hour law and if it turned out that the best day to pick for that purpose was one already observed by the great number of people in the United States or in the Commonwealth, then for purposes of achieving a day of rest, it would be highly desirable to pick one already observed by the people as a result of custom and uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.175" offset="3956067">Now, if it -- once it is admitted and I don't believe it's actually denied that a state may enact one day as a day of rest, then the mere fact that they might pick out a day where other people would or some of the people would be observing it for persons or reasons of a religious nature, does not in and of itself, make the statute invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1031.053" offset="4227636">We have a state determination in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Commonwealth v. Has, which is cited in our brief and examined at some detail, which says that, although the statute may initially have had a religious background, it now and this is as of the middle of the 1800s, is a statute setting up one day of rest in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.766" offset="4322408">And the mere fact that it may have had a religious history does not make it valid -- invalid as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.963" offset="4351248">I would point out, Your Honor, that the -- when this statute initially started, it didn't just prohibit people from opening shop on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.202" offset="4384162">This statute obliged people to attend services and to that extent, the initial history of the statute in colonial days, would indicate that there was a religious basis to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.245" offset="4440377">I think it -- it's fundamental that many of the colonies when -- when set up, were set up because of religious grounds and we can't deny the history of our country and say that there was no religious basis in some of the statutes which they enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.712" offset="4498265">But through the passage of time, the adoption of the Constitution, the changes which have been made in the statute itself, one which at that time, served the needs of the community from a religious viewpoint, has been the vehicle whereby, today, one day of rest is set aside out of seven so that, instead of -- of people being oppressed and having to work because of the pressure of competition, they are now able to take that one particular day and spend it with their families and what have you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.467" offset="5077243">Let's assume -- assume, Your Honor that you are correct that there is no absolute requirement that this take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.476" offset="5101275">Here, we have a question of discretion as far as the legislature of a state is concerned and it is a problem then of whether the legislature in the proper exercise of its discretion, does have a right to pick out one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.765" offset="5154461">Now, you or I or any other person may say, that is undesirable from a legislative viewpoint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1270.363" offset="5184867">That's the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.236" offset="5192286">As such, we would say, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.949" offset="5203153">Now, many of us may disagree with a particular day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.525" offset="5213497">Many of us may disagree with the fact that there's not one day in -- in seven that you do, rather than pick out the particular day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.921" offset="5239097">But, if the legislature in the proper exercise of its discretion, has selected this one particular day, then we do not feel that it is for a court to say that the legislature has acted improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.463" offset="5297194">There is one other point on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.714" offset="5306180">As far as this Massachusetts statute is concerned, there are many exceptions to it, Your Honor, whereby people may stay open on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.040" offset="5335542">In the brief, we have spelled out that -- the exceptions to it and of course, the statute is set forth in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.532" offset="5361455">People, for example, running roadside stands, if you happen to be driving a car, you could stop, people running certain amusement areas, people conducting businesses which would be essential for the carrying on of -- of life today, transportation, fuel, necessary, things of that sort, all of those people would be in a category where they could be called upon to work without violating this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.656" offset="5465945">Now, if those people who have to work on Sunday are to be given the benefit of one day off, anyway and they can't take Sunday, fairly clearly, it would be up to the Commonwealth in its discretion to pick out some other day and thus, it is said that, where we run into a situation where people might be working on Sunday, an employer cannot insist that thereafter, they work the other six days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.946" offset="5563120">To that extent, I would say that our statute saying that you cannot have seven consecutive days, is a necessary adjunct to our Sunday Law, so-called, which in effect says, “everybody closes on Sunday except” the people that then have to work on Sunday are given the benefit of this other day which may be available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.510" offset="5953390">The complaint -- to refer back to it for just a moment, raises constitutional questions here, predicated upon the Sunday statute, which raised the Fourteenth Amendment as a -- an argument that this Sunday Law is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.417" offset="6017024">Now, the first one and the one that I think we have discussed to some extent here is that the statute in Massachusetts is one, which establishes a religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.778" offset="6054536">We have explored part of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.000" offset="6063417">Let me point out to you, Your Honors that this particular statute, if it is examined a little more detailed, pages 81 to 89 in our brief, there is adequate to show that the exceptions in the statute themselves, have now changed the very tenor of the statute so that it is one of a lay regulation providing for rest, recreation or providing a -- a day when people, if they desire, may carry-on religious pursuits, where they're free to do as they please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.202" offset="6188178">They are freed of the obligation to work on Sunday, other than for the necessities that may be set forth here in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.296" offset="6232586">This statute is attacked on another ground, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.910" offset="6250977">It is claimed that as far as the particular statute is concerned, it not only is predicated upon religion, but that it deprives the complainants in this particular instance of due process of law in the sense that their liberty to carry-on religious activities have been restricted and to the extent that we are dealing with the corporation itself, that its right to moneys have been interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.997" offset="6371349">Under the allegations in the complaint, it is said for example, that the various exceptions which appear in the statute are arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.722" offset="6414294">And to that extent, I would assume that even if the statute were not a religious one, that the complainants in this particular proceeding are raising the supplementary and additional ground that the statute itself denies the equal protection of the laws to the plaintiffs -- to the complainants in this particular action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.806" offset="6498617">Now, to analyze that problem, we must look at the complainants who are actually bringing this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.099" offset="6527770">There is a question of parties here, Your Honor, a question of whether or not they had a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.147" offset="6543966">I believe, we have put it forth in our brief in some detail and I don't intend to belabor it in oral argument as such, but a brief reference to that position as complainants in relation to their constitutional rights, I think, would not necessarily be out of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.681" offset="6618049">For example, Your Honor, there are three individual complainants here who purport to be, I shouldn't say purport to be, they have found -- they are found to be customers of this Kosher Super Market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.707" offset="6682206">They contend and we have agreed that they observe the Saturday as the Sabbath and we have agreed that they would not shop on Friday after sundown, nor would they shop on Saturday and that -- to that extent, it would be at least an inconvenience for them, if they were unable to shop on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.110" offset="6775829">Now, here Your Honors, we have a problem of three customers of a store complaining on behalf of the store, that the store is not open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.941" offset="6819088">Now, we have made diligent search of the cases and we have yet to find a case holding that a customer of a store per se, has a constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment to have all stores remain open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.111" offset="6879796">Now, this argument of course, is going somewhat -- beyond the basic religious one as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.700" offset="6902157">It's the -- the second part of it on due process as to the religious rights of these customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.585" offset="6925667">And as we have pointed out, we believe any claim which those customers may have in connection with the interference with their right to shop is not per se, one which should allow them to raise its constitutional point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.285" offset="9236564">Secondly, to the extent that they are again, proper parties to raise this matter, does it deprive them of equal protection of the laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.834" offset="9278673">And I think basically there, Your Honor, we are coming to the question of the corporation as to whether, to the Fourteenth Amendment, it has been deprived of its rights under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.527" offset="9325484">Now, the objection appears to be that the limitations in this statute are ones which are arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.543" offset="9357563">As far as we're able to determine, Your Honor, under the -- the Lindsley case, the -- the various elements that would have to be satisfied by a complainant would not here, have been properly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.536" offset="9409494">They would have to show, as I understand it, that under no set of facts -- no reasonable set of facts, could it be said that the legislature had acted in an improper or arbitrary manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.033" offset="9463515">And I would suggest to you, Your Honor, without going through each and every element in this particular proceeding that the statute itself, is one which now creates a day of rest, whereby, there are certain exceptions to it and each and every exception would fall into one or more of the general type exceptions that would be expected on a day of rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.601" offset="9569782">Now, in our brief, Your Honor, we have gone to some extent starting at page 66 in analyzing the type exceptions that might be expected in Sunday statutes, whether they'd be in Massachusetts or elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.168" offset="9628087">And if an examination of those is made, it would appear that here, we have exceptions as I mentioned previously, for allowing the essential industries to be carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.998" offset="9683362">We have exceptions that will allow a person to enjoy a day of rest whereby, there can't be too much noise as a result of these activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.654" offset="9717948">We have exceptions which will allow entertainment industries to be carried on so that people enjoying their day of rest will not just have to sit home and -- and not be able to carry-on those type recreations which would extend to a -- a day off as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.032" offset="9795480">The exceptions per se then, we would say on the face of them, can each and every one of them be explained?</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.008" offset="9827453">Now, in Judge Magruder's decision, he has picked out a few of them and pointed to the fact that they are arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.650" offset="9853994">He has pointed out for example, that you may dig oysters on Sunday -- excuse me, may dig clams on Sunday, but you're not allowed to dredge oysters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.339" offset="9896730">Well, looking at it quickly and say what's the difference between a clam and an oyster, but again, if you look at the history here in Massachusetts, it becomes quite apparent that people as a matter of pleasure, go down to the beaches on low tides and dig clams.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.444" offset="10241128">And to the extent that the complainant has that burden, he has completely failed to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.693" offset="10266102">And in his brief, he has suggested that the Commonwealth or the chief of police here has failed to explain these exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.965" offset="10299225">I would say that here, he has completely lost track to the fact that he has the burden of showing the invalidity of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.984" offset="10331303">Now, let me point out to you one other difficulty that arises in -- in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.834" offset="10350738">In the complaint, it's alleged that the statute is -- is one of a religious nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.599" offset="10377801">It's also urged that the liberty of the customers is interfered with because of that religious aspect and it's urged lastly and perhaps significantly, that the exceptions in this particular Massachusetts statute are arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.991" offset="10443316">But then Judge Magruder, in his majority opinion, states all the constitutional exceptions that have been well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.449" offset="10485217">That would mean, Your Honor, as I read that decision, that the Massachusetts statute is itself per se, perhaps on the face of it, unconstitutional on the ground, at least that the exceptions in it, are arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.476" offset="10549269">If the exceptions are arbitrary, then what should the good judge have done when a decree was entered?</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.927" offset="10575078">I think, quite clearly, Your Honors, he would have had to have reached the conclusion that this statute as applied to these complainants was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.559" offset="10613635">Did he?</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.261" offset="10616456">He did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.799" offset="10622516">He entered a decree that said, this statute is unconstitutional as to these plaintiffs, if they close on Friday night and Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.521" offset="10665462">I suggest to you, Your Honors, if they opened on Friday night and they opened on Saturday, how were the classifications of the statute be any less arbitrary on Sunday?</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.288" offset="10720528">To that extent, Your Honors, we would claim that this decree as entered here, certainly, is not one which would be consistent within the findings of fact or with the decree, the determination on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.260" offset="10780400">We have had all kinds of difficulties now in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts trying to determine the validity of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.320" offset="10808613">Now that point was called to the attention of the judge after he entered the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.909" offset="10823032">We had quite a discussion on the form of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.231" offset="10832332">As a result of the decree, we filed a motion for rehearing and one of the grounds we raised is that the decree itself, was inconsistent with the finding of the judge and as a result of that motion, the judge came back again with a -- another determination that we had misread his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.957" offset="10915192">Well, maybe we did misread it, perhaps, we don't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.481" offset="10933269">But as far as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is concerned, if our Sunday Laws are to be thrown out completely, we ought to know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.223" offset="10968273">We ought to know what the ground is because basically here, this is a Fourteenth Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.704" offset="10990216">The real question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.464" offset="10997217">Can the Commonwealth of Massachusetts pick one day in seven and set it aside as a day of rest?</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.906" offset="11023026">If they can, then the Commonwealth of Massachusetts would desire to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.553" offset="11045595">If they can do it by the vehicle which they have here before them, they would desire to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.145" offset="11067956">But if they cannot and one day in seven cannot be picked out and the Fourteenth Amendment would prohibit that from being done, it's about time we found out about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.752" offset="11114350">As I understand from reading the Constitution and the cases, there is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment that would prohibit the Commonwealth of Massachusetts from picking out one day in seven if they so desire, whether it be Sunday, Saturday or any other day in the week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.200" offset="11176208">And if they once go in that assumption then basically, we have a right to enact a statute such as we have here, provided of course, that we do not violate any other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.790" offset="11222497">If we have violated other provisions of the Constitution, what are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.389" offset="11240887">I say that from this decision of Judge Magruder, we cannot tell what actually was his determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.212" offset="11272234">We would say, if it's on a question of the statute being arbitrary that he has gone into the minds of the legislature where the courts should not go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.215" offset="11308283">He has gone into a realm where the courts themselves from time immemorial, have not tread.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.300" offset="11332524">To that extent, Your Honor, we would say on the ground, he should not have thrown out this Sunday statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.257" offset="11360423">If it is predicated upon the fact that this is a religious statute, then he is gone in the face of almost every judicial determination that has been made in all of the States of the Union and in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.912" offset="11419042">To that extent, Your Honors, we have gathered together in our brief numerous decisions whereby, this Court has passed upon the merit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3648.102" offset="14695737">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.773" offset="14726457">At the outset, I would say that I can well understand the difficulty that some of the Justices are having in understanding the chapter 136, insofar as it relates to people who keep the Sabbath day on the -- on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.162" offset="14816005">There was trouble in the court -- in the three-judge court on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.106" offset="14835754">The reason for that is not that these -- these portions of this law have not been adequately interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.416" offset="14869086">They have been interpreted, but they have been interpreted by our Supreme Court in such a strange way that is hard to believe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.095" offset="14915793">Now, if Your Honors will turn to the Act which appears in Mr. Elcock's brief, section 5 is the section which forbids the keeping open of a shop or the doing of any labor business or works except works of necessity and charity, that's on page 84.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.690" offset="15034180">Then, you turn to page 87 and you see where the first complete paragraph begins and that is the language which says, “Nor shall it prohibit the performing of secular business and labor on the Lords day,” I call your attention to secular business and labor on the Lords day, by any person who conscientiously believes that the seventh day of the week ought to be observed as the Sabbath and actually refrains from secular business and labor on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.027" offset="15155493">Now, Mr. Chernock urged that in his exceptions to our Supreme Court and our Supreme Court ruled on the basis of Commonwealth against Has, that that language did not permit the opening of a shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.884" offset="15218918">It was not included in secular business and labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.753" offset="15234382">They said, relying on Commonwealth against Has, that he could not maintain his shop under that, no matter whether he did or did not observe the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.237" offset="15288299">Now, you move just above that and you'll find a more recent exception which says, "Nor shall it forbid the keeping open of his shop on the Lords day for the sale of kosher meat between the hours of 6 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the fore noon, not noon, 10 o'clock in the fore noon."</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.394" offset="15368965">I will not at this point, comment upon the practical effect of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.229" offset="15392266">The three-judge majority opinion found that that was wholly impracticable and impossible really, for any business to operate on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.979" offset="15435316">But, you will see that the keeping open his shop on the Lords day for the sale of kosher meat between the hours of 6 o'clock and 10 o'clock and the fore noon, is the section under which Mr. Chernock was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.352" offset="15492786">So that, I don't understand what there is to be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.347" offset="15512743">He has been convicted under that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.168" offset="15527999">He was not allowed to escape under the next section and not only does Commonwealth against Chernock hold this, but my brother and friend here apparently, has forgotten the case of Commonwealth against Starr, which is cited on our brief, because that very neatly disposes of nearly all of his contentions that there were still something to be interpreted in that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.084" offset="15631757">Commonwealth against Starr was a case in which a -- a rabbi kept his house open for the sale only of kosher products to members of his congregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.793" offset="15690585">He closed on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.646" offset="15698004">He sold only to members of his congregation who also observed Saturday as the Sabbath and the Supreme Court of Massachusetts said that didn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.970" offset="15747218">He kept open his shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.304" offset="15756622">That was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.070" offset="15767698">So that, the suggestion that it was because Mr. Chernock sold to other people or because he sold things that were not strictly kosher, under our decisions, has no relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.280" offset="15820466">Here was a man who sold only to members of his own congregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.322" offset="15832691">He was a rabbi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.182" offset="15836139">He was authorized to call the food kosher, which he did and see to it that his congregation bought only that type of food.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.205" offset="15872188">Then there was another Jewish merchant or manufacturer who tried to avoid the impact of this statute by not selling anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.310" offset="15928613">He had a little shop for 8 or 10 people, that's Commonwealth versus Kershaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.251" offset="15944391">It is also on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.176" offset="15956093">He'd did deem open it, he just left the door open for 8 or 10 employees to come into the shop and they closed the door and locked it, so they couldn't disturb anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.246" offset="15992351">They were all Jewish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.975" offset="15999248">They all observed the -- the seventh day of the week as a Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.848" offset="16018787">He was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.271" offset="16024430">He kept the shop and it didn't make any difference whether he opened it or whether he didn't open it or whether he disturbed anybody or whether he didn't disturb anybody or whether he sold anything to anybody or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.191" offset="16064136">He kept open his shop and that's been the interpretation of that and there's no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.420" offset="16081063">We've cited the cases on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.532" offset="16089527">I have mentioned only a few involving Jewish merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.502" offset="16109380">The foundation case is Commonwealth versus Has that started all this trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.425" offset="16125053">He was a Seventh-Day Adventist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.513" offset="16137383">Now, I'm saying this because I feel that at the outset we should understand that there just isn't any question about opening a shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.863" offset="16182836">Under any of these conditions, it's forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.040" offset="16195584">Even under that six to ten statute, they can't sell anything but meat -- kosher meat, nothing else and then they have to quit at 10 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.119" offset="16247829">It would perhaps be important at this stage to call attention to the realities of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.730" offset="16282311">Some of the Justices mentioned it at the start of -- of Mr. Elcock's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.192" offset="16308120">We are not talking about a violation of the symbols of religion as some of the very important cases that have come before you have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.106" offset="16347826">We are talking about hardship, about serious interference with the liberty of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.434" offset="16377083">There are findings of fact in this case concerning the obligations of Orthodox use to observe the Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.288" offset="16408534">They may not travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.210" offset="16412191">They may not ride in automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.612" offset="16417834">They may not even light lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.918" offset="16427029">They had to do their cooking on Friday so that they don't have to cook on Saturday, on the Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.013" offset="16451375">The Sabbath evening is a joyous occasion where they have the best meal of the week.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.685" offset="16470079">Saturday, they go to the synagogue and Saturday afternoon, they also have a celebration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.434" offset="16489096">The family all get-together and celebrate the Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.029" offset="16503515">They're not allowed to buy anything on the Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.854" offset="16522742">Now, we have this statute that says that there can be no store that sells food that their -- the only kind of food that under their religion, if they live up to it, they may eat, must be closed on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.366" offset="16588884">The effect of that is if it's enforced, is that in this particular case, the Crown Kosher Super Market would have to go out of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="4172.153" offset="16792012">Now, on the question of whether or not, the -- the law takes property without due process of law or whether it is -- denies equal protection, it's possible that that would make a -- would not make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.037" offset="16871528">I'll put it perhaps in this -- in this vice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.570" offset="16885635">Let us for the moment, accept my brother's statement which we cannot accept as I will hope to show you in a few minutes, that this is a day of rest statute, a universal day of rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.000" offset="16947388">Not -- not just the one day in a week but that everybody has to rest on the same day and let us further assume which I cannot at this time concede, that it is within the police power of the State to establish such -- such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.307" offset="17028577">And let us further assume that the Massachusetts court in Commonwealth against Has and indeed, many other -- courts are right, in saying that they selected Sunday, my brother made this argument, as the day of rest, because the majority of people already observed Sunday as our Court in Commonwealth versus Has said, "Because it is a day of peculiar sanctity to the majority of people who are Christians."</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.609" offset="17141844">Do they not, when they do that, make it easy for those who are already observing Sunday because they already refrain from work, they already regard the day as sacred?</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.706" offset="17206209">So that, they lose only one day a week, whereas if that law is enforced without an exception in favor of those who observe another day as the Sabbath, they lose two days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.528" offset="17265455">They lose 100 days during the year, instead of 50 days in a year or 52 days in a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.845" offset="17294712">And that Mr. Justice Douglas, is the best answer, I think at the moment, I can give you that -- that that does play a vital part and that if was a question of an atheist under certain branch of this argument, it would not be unconstitutional as against him -- I mean, as -- as applied -- but as applied against somebody who observed the seventh day as the Sabbath, it is a discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.209" offset="17396172">It is a preference of one religion over another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.237" offset="17404322">It is a denial of -- of the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.724" offset="17418219">That point incidentally, was made by a number of our middle-western courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4701.093" offset="18907721">In order to ascertain what this Massachusetts law really is, we should start with what it started with and then end with what it is now and let us see what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.266" offset="18988387">First, I would like to have you look at this statute through the eyes of our Supreme Judicial Court back in 1816 and then I would like to take you to the last decided case before the Chernock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.457" offset="19041155">This early case was the case of Pearce against Atwood, where a justice of the peace arrested a traveler on a large day and the court there said it would certainly seem extraordinary that a statute enacted for the sole object of ensuring reverence and respect for one day of the week, in order that religious exercises should be performed without interruption from common and secular employments, should authorize acts which from their necessary publicity, would be likely to cause more disturbance to devout people and all the irregularities intended to be cured and then the court went on to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.648" offset="19210010">It is true from the fourth command in the Decalogue, it may be inferred that one day in seven was, according to the divine will to be set apart as a day of rest from labor, but none will contend that the day therein sanctified, is the day which Christians are bound to keep as holy time or that any of the rigid laws of Moses relative to the observance of that day are now enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.308" offset="19308648">It is enough to observe that by universal consent of Christians, another holy day has been substituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.668" offset="19338010">That was our Court in 1816.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.663" offset="19358072">Now, in Commonwealth versus McCarthy in 1923, our Supreme Court and that was the last case that characterized our Sunday Closing Law prior to the Chernock conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.993" offset="19431320">The court there, and this was an odd case too, because if you examine the statute very carefully, you will see that while at certain hours, bread may be sold, this baker was charged with delivering bread to the -- to common victuallers and the Court held that although he could bake bread, and he could sell bread at certain hours, he couldn't deliver it to his customers and this was the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.156" offset="19524002">The delivery of bread outside the premises of the baker on the Lords day is not a work of necessity within the meaning of the Lords day statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.095" offset="19555767">The statute prohibiting the performance of labor, business or work except works of necessity and charity on Sunday was enacted to secure respect and reverence for the Lords day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.512" offset="19601429">And then, the Court goes on to quote with approval, citing the language and adopting it of Davis against Summerville which was decided three years after the case of Commonwealth against Has that my brother adverted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.168" offset="19660048">I'll speak about that decision in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.829" offset="19670706">It was characterized by Judge Magruder as an ad hoc decision and I think that this Court will agree with Judge Magruder's characterization of that decision, but, this was three years after that decision and it was adopted in 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.320" offset="19732668">The statute making it unlawful and criminal to travel on the Lords day except from necessity and charity, has retained its place in our statute books from the earliest time -- times in the history of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.431" offset="19781047">This also was a curious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.404" offset="19792959">The defendant in this case travelled on the Lords day and at that time, the statute included that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.885" offset="19814902">They hadn't eliminated it and he was accused of violating the Lords day statute, because he had gone to a funeral which was regarded as a journey of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.135" offset="19863907">But in coming home from the funeral, he stopped to call on a friend and they said he -- he had to come straight home because otherwise, it was a violation of the Lords day statute and the conviction was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.471" offset="19913226">So, you -- the Court went on to say in upholding that conviction, our puritan ancestors intended that the day should be not merely a day of rest from labor, but also a day devoted to public and private worship and to religious meditation and repose, undisturbed by secular cares or amusements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.839" offset="19982712">They saw fit to enforce the observance of the day by penal legislation and the statute regulations which they devised for that purpose have continued to enforce without any substantial modification to the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.561" offset="20033599">Whatever inconveniences might result at the present day from the literal and general enforcement of the Lords day Act and whatever hard cases may arise -- may have arisen under it, it is still the law of the land to be judicially interpreted and administered according to its true intent and meaning and upon the same rules as would govern us in the interpretation of any other statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="5340.295" offset="21464586">Commonwealth against Has came in 1877 after a stream of decisions holding that this statute was a religious statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.972" offset="21503248">Commonwealth against Has was the first case in which the question of -- of constitutionality under the religious provisions of the -- of the Massachusetts constitution were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.535" offset="21557478">Thereupon, the court out of a clear sky without any analysis of the statute at all, without any reference to the many cases that have gone before stating that it was to ensure reverence of -- of the Lords day, proceeded to say that it was merely a civil regulation providing for a fixed period of rest in the business and ordinary evocations and the amusements of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.126" offset="21671894">Incidentally, that reference to amusements of the community is also a little strange because Mr. Elcock has now argued that it is not only transited from a religious statute to a day of rest statute that has now become an amusement statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.445" offset="21741171">That it is -- its purpose is now to allow people to enjoy themselves on Sunday and go to the ballgame and go fishing and digging clams.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.167" offset="21780041">Now, the hours -- I would like to read to the Court some of the hours of the exceptions which are so clearly hours to protect church worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.423" offset="21825076">Now, there's no reason why there shouldn't be protection of church worship, but it indicates an attempt to preserve the character, the original character of the statute even while the exceptions are being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5447.396" offset="21892995">For instance, outdoor lawn bowling, golf driving ranges and so forth, are -- are permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.894" offset="21938970">Amusement parks and beaches, license to operate bowling alleys, private industrial trade expositions, participation in or witnessing athletic sports or games and there is no one of these that's allowed to be given before 1 o'clock in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.735" offset="22002291">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.604" offset="22005739">If it's a day of rest, why -- why can't they do that before 1 o'clock in the afternoon or if it's just to promote amusements? Incidentally, I have a difficulty there also, a logical difficulty, by allowing people to -- to pursue amusements on Sunday that they've already been pursuing for six days a week, does not seem to me to constitute Sunday a day to pursue amusements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.639" offset="22097899">But if it is a day to pursue amusements, then I think perhaps, we ought to reexamine the entire basis for the exercise of police power which makes people stay away from secular pursuits 52 days a year and -- and people who believe in the seventh day, 104 days a year, as it would -- cannot be weighed against the interference with liberty and property which this Act creates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.328" offset="22192671">Now, here are - here are a few more that are astounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.037" offset="22211480">The retail sale of bread is allowed between 10:00 a.m. and -- and is allowed before 10:00 a.m. and between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.167" offset="22252022">Transportation of general commodities by motor truck or trailer before 8:00 a.m. and after 8:00 p.m., that's interstate trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.177" offset="22288071">Now, one would suppose that it would disturb rest much more to have these trucks rumble around in the morning than during the day, but this is the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.533" offset="22333524">Here again, I say it -- it's to quiet down things before church services on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.631" offset="22357870">Transportation of petroleum products from motor truck are permitted only before 6:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m., the selling of bake -- sale of bakery products by bakers before 10:00 a.m. and between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., the sale of kosher meat by the observers of the seventh day as the Sabbath, between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.231" offset="22452328">Now, it is difficult to understand what logical connection that would have with either a day of rest or amusement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.522" offset="22493497">One would suppose that the opening of a shop so early in the morning, if it ever was opened early and if any customers would ever come at that hour, would be disturbing to rest, rather than otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.308" offset="22540622">And certainly, if it's a day of amusement for people to come in and buy some salami for a picnic, would aid in that pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.751" offset="22574373">No, these -- these hours that I have here -- or the bootblack has to stop at 11:00 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.404" offset="22604988">Now, as I said, this -- if Your Honors would -- will take the -- the hard task of reading the statute, I am confident that you'll come to the same conclusion that Judges Magruder and Woodbury came through that it's an unbelievable hodgepodge that there's no rhyme or reason to any logical purpose that this Act is supposed to serve to have this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.954" offset="22723166">You will find on page -- pages 49, 50 and 51, we have listed dozens of things that are permitted, some of which were absolutely without any explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.666" offset="22786069">My brother has tried to hazard some, taking Judge McCarthy's view that digging of clams is an amusement and not work as one who's dug clams, I can testify it's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.552" offset="22833612">However, the fact of the matter is that Judge McCarthy wasn't quite right on his -- his -- on the culture of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5692.143" offset="22871960">The fact of the matter is that clams one of the big commercial industries at my State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.205" offset="22892231">You drive along in the summer time there you can't throw a rock without hitting the shoreline, a -- a place that would sell steamed clams to the passerby.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.637" offset="22941968">It is true that it can be done by -- by an amateur such as myself occasionally, but it's a commercial operation and sea clams are dredged just as oysters are dredged and not only are they dredged but they're seeded and this is a big business in Massachusetts, the seeding of clams.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.063" offset="22999646">So that this attempt to explain that the digging of clams is alright because of some idea that people -- individual people like to do it, comes back to an a -- the only agreement that I know between Mr. Elcock and myself on some of the fundamentals of this case.</text>
