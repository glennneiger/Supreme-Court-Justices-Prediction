            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="11.234" offset="148355">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.414" offset="165073">This case is here on writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Commonwealth of Virginia, which, in turn, had denied petition for writ of error, to review the judgment of the Hustings Court of Richmond, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.467" offset="241246">The facts in the case are rather simple and not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.938" offset="267160">On December 20, 1958, petitioner, a Negro law student from Howard University here in Washington was en route home to Selma, Alabama on his Christmas vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.576" offset="341661">He boarded the Trailway Bus here in Washington, D.C. and en route to Selma, Alabama the bus made a routine stop at approximately 10:40 p.m. in Richmond, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.116" offset="407803">The bus drove up, the Trailways Bus, drove up to the Trailways Bus Terminal in Richmond and announced that there would be a 40-minute layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.821" offset="450644">The petitioner being hungry and anxious to eat before reboarding, he went into the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.476" offset="481259">There were two restaurants there.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.118" offset="491813">One marked for white persons and one for colored.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.196" offset="512188">The petitioner testified that the colored restaurant appeared to be crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.079" offset="535698">Now, here the Commonwealth disputes that because the testimony of the Assistant Manager was that at some time after when this whole incident was going along, he noticed that it was not crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.230" offset="592332">So the question that I submit is, I think we will show later as immaterial anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.937" offset="619081">The petitioner testified that after he noticed, it appeared to him that this Negro place was crowded, he proceeded to the other restaurant, which was not crowded, and there's no dispute on that, the other was not crowded and he took one of the vacant stools, sat down, and one of the waitresses approached him and told him that he should go over to the other restaurant and the petitioner told her that the facilities in other restaurant appeared to be crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.813" offset="738617">He was an interstate commerce passenger and that he should be served in restaurant -- this restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.991" offset="763382">After some discussion, the waitress suggested that he purchase a prepared sandwich.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.365" offset="792848">He therefore ordered one of these prepared sandwiches and a cup of tea.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.836" offset="810715">The waitress returned to him and said, she couldn't serve him and she had orders not to serve him.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.898" offset="830986">He explained again that he was an interstate passenger and should be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.020" offset="851466">The waitress went away again and this time she came back with Assistant Manager who later testified and hearing the petitioner testified, he showed the Assistant Manager his ticket that he had a right to eat there.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.224" offset="912280">The Manager asked him to move out.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.231" offset="924296">There's no question all along in this that the whole basis of asking him to move and the whole basis of refusing to serve him in this restaurant was because of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.794" offset="966510">At this stage, the manager went out and returned with a policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.754" offset="990438">Then there's some conflict between the testimony of the Assistant Manager and the petitioner in this case as to exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.554" offset="1037563">That is whether the petitioner went out and came back or whether the manager went out with a policeman, but it's significant that the manager's testimony says that he reported to the policeman at that point the petitioner was creating a disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.151" offset="1120005">The policeman came in, there's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.200" offset="1136201">That the policeman entered in -- entered into the discussion, trying to persuade the petitioner to move over to the other restaurant and I emphasize this because later on in this argument, we hope to get to the question of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.913" offset="1195029">The state action moves in at this point that the Assistant Manager and the police are jointly trying to persuade petitioner to be segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.618" offset="1245811">And the petitioner says, he has a right to eat there and he wants to eat there.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.543" offset="1265560">The policeman then asked the manager, “Do you want him arrested? Do you want to get a warrant for him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="295.883" offset="1286875">The manager says, “Not unless he refuses to go.”</text>
            <text syncTime="300.525" offset="1305475">Then he did get the warrant and got -- the manager straight got the warrant and the petitioner was arrested and put in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.389" offset="1336926">The warrant -- the original trial was based on the fact that he was a trespasser, but you'll notice in the record that this trespass allegation was immediately amended to provide that it was one of these trespass cases where he refused to move after being told.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.165" offset="1424071">And the statute which we set forth on page four of our brief, the one under which Boynton was convicted, is if any person shall without authority of law go upon or remain upon the lands or premises of another after having been forbidden to do so by the owner's, let's say custodian or other person lawfully in-charge of such land, or having been forbidden to do so by a sign or sign posted on the premises at a place or places where they maybe reasonably seen, he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction there to be punished by a fine of not more than $100 or by confinement in jail not exceeding 30 days or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.615" offset="1613824">And it's a theory of the prosecution in this case that he was guilty of violating this statute because in fact he didn't move when first asked to be moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.196" offset="1668159">Now, as I see it the facts in this case add up to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.467" offset="1697207">There was no dispute that the petitioner was an interstate passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.388" offset="1716955">As a matter of fact his ticket was tendered in the Court and that he not only was an interstate passenger, but he was actually in passage between Washington and Selma, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.024" offset="1763453">This was an interrupted passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.707" offset="1770245">The bus -- the Trailways Bus stopped at the Trailways Bus Terminal and all of this were on the property of the Trailways Bus Terminal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="437.416" offset="1853001">The record shows in this case that the bus company -- the restaurant was owned and operated by the restaurant company under a lease from the Trailways Bus Terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.212" offset="1912247">That's what the record shows.</text>

            <label>Justice Charles E. Whittaker</label>
            <text syncTime="454.017" offset="1919457">And do you present that this was the question to be contested Mr. Marshall?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="460.101" offset="1943803">I do not claim that on the facts that are in the record, I do not claim that the bus company owned the restaurant or controlled it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.411" offset="1984972">But this Court when the petition for certiorari was filed requested the State of Virginia to furnish whatever evidence they had and it's whether or not judicial notice could be taken to the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.235" offset="2036276">And the Commonwealth replied that there was no -- there was no documents which the Supreme Court of Virginia should take cognisance of.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.758" offset="2074415">However, the United States, as amicus curiae, has produced to this Court, the documents of the Interstate Commerce Commission which do show that control.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.315" offset="2112658">I admit quite frankly that so far as the record is concerned, it's not there, but so far as the present posture of this case is concerned, it is there because it's certainly in the brief of the United States and if there is any dispute as to it, you have it in here representing the Commonwealth today not only the Assistant Attorney General, but also the lawyer from the restaurant and he knows who controls it.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.985" offset="2755271">The difference as I see it is that under the Commerce Clause itself, we would not be obliged to show that the carrier actually controlled the restaurant, if in fact the restaurant can be shown to interfere with the flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.585" offset="2825697">Under the Interstate Commerce Act, and particularly the motor carriers division, it does limit into a terminal that is controlled by the carrier, but I see not too much difference between the argument which we could make for the clause or the act for this reason.</text>
