          <turn speaker="jack_wilson" startTime="0.000" stopTime="320.449">
            <label>Mr. Jack Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.803" offset="159619">Shortly before the recess, I had stated to the Court that it was the appellee's view that in this case of great importance not only to the State of Tennessee but to the United States of America that there are law and all certain great constitutional principles here involved not mentioned by the appellants which must certainly should be considered by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.693" offset="283126">I had mentioned the question of whether this case is a case or controversy whether it does present issues for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.931" offset="336102">I had mentioned and I now ask the Court to consider the question of what the subject matter of this suit is.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.899" offset="383958">The appellants have said in two arguments that this is a case of individual voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.835" offset="419694">I take it may it please the Court that if this is not a case of individual voting rights then the appellants must concede that there is no case for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.161" offset="477059">What does the complaint over here?</text>
            <text syncTime="96.521" offset="490433">Well, it says it's been denied to write vote but you turnover next page and they said, "Oh no," it's -- it's an inadequate legislative representation, well, which is you turnover another page, they say it's improper and inevitable distribution of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.660" offset="583011">Now, let's look at the trials of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.092" offset="600775">I think that it should be one of the surest tasks they have for the reason that a practitioner at the bar for instance does not bring a suit for damages based on negligence and free for an absolute divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.152" offset="669006">His trial must be consistent with his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.947" offset="684157">A practitioner certainly does not ask that a written answer be reformed and then pray that a cooperation be dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.690" offset="723132">Oh no, the relief ask in this case is that the Legislature of Tennessee be real portioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.208" offset="769212">The relief asked is that an election at large be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.408" offset="798051">Now, may it please the Court if this isn't individual voting rights case and I wish to discuss that still above in my argument a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.622" offset="842877">Why is there not a prayer somewhere in the complaint that these appellants be permitted to ridge to say or that these appellants permitted to put their votes in the ballot box?</text>
            <text syncTime="201.272" offset="909437">Oh no, that if not in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.624" offset="926887">So what is this lawsuit if -- if we must -- if the Court must determine whether there is a case and controversy, what is the subject matter of the lawsuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="216.578" offset="970668">Well, it's legislative representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.367" offset="985819">It's legislative representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.057" offset="996582">And how there have the Court's turned it?</text>
            <text syncTime="225.746" offset="1007344">Is this something just being suggested by the appellees here?</text>
            <text syncTime="229.679" offset="1023122">Oh no, the District Court said this, "The question of the distribution of political strength for legislative purposes, not to vote, not the right to vote."</text>
            <text syncTime="242.458" offset="1074218">What did this Court say in South against Peters?</text>
            <text syncTime="246.201" offset="1089160">How did it turned the question?</text>
            <text syncTime="248.962" offset="1100236">The geographical distribution of electro restraint that is the subject matter of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.878" offset="1139942">Now, may it please the Court, I asked that the Court consider one of the cases that we cited in the brief Coleman against Miller in 307 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.526" offset="1190515">And I wish to discuss those facts a little bit later if time permits, but I called this Court's attention at this time to an opinion by one of the three judges who were sitting at that time and are now on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.532" offset="1266479">And that's the opinion, concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in which Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Black specifically concurred and that opinion is trace the subject of the subject matter to be considered by our federal court under the constitutional provision permitting federal courts to hear cases and controversies.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="320.449" stopTime="324.468">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="320.449" offset="1386224">Mr. Attorney General, is the fact that I'm still allowed, that brings us to the opinion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_wilson" startTime="324.468" stopTime="330.538">
            <label>Mr. Jack Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="324.468" offset="1402316">May it please the Court, I think that that opinion much little of the century yet to come.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="330.538" stopTime="332.700">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="330.538" offset="1426557">And I can --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_wilson" startTime="332.700" stopTime="1252.623">
            <label>Mr. Jack Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="332.700" offset="1435230">May it please the Court in that opinion which is the opinion of three members of this Court now sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.924" offset="1468144">The Court discusses the subject of what type matters the federal courts hear and what is the first length that said that traditional matters that was -- of concerned at the courts of Westminster, oh, at the colonial judges, the courts of England from which the columnist had come.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.884" offset="1579948">And what else is said in that opinion that the subject matter must held the expert field of the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.583" offset="1618714">The expert field of the lawyers, as a trial lawyer in the courts of Tennessee day in and day out as one who is concern with procedure, with practice, with the weight to elegance, there are many questions in this case which concern me because they do not have the expert field of the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.952" offset="1716203">What is the injury in this case incidentally?</text>
            <text syncTime="405.601" offset="1726757">What is the injury that survived?</text>
            <text syncTime="408.199" offset="1737206">The inequitable distribution of state tax bonds is that legal cloth for the judiciary to cut?</text>
            <text syncTime="419.884" offset="1783912">As a trial or lawyer, how would you prove in a court of equity that taxes are inequitably distributed?</text>
            <text syncTime="431.320" offset="1829679">In Tennessee, and our State Chancery courts and we have courts of equity, separate courts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.158" offset="1861026">We may have a jury in the State Chancery court.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.676" offset="1875132">How would a trial judge charge a jury on what constitutes the inequitable distribution of state taxes?</text>
            <text syncTime="454.733" offset="1923302">Is this a type of issue that this Court or any federal court will have?</text>
            <text syncTime="461.988" offset="1952350">I suggest not.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.027" offset="1960500">What else has this Court said?</text>
            <text syncTime="466.305" offset="1969591">And it was mentioned in the period before lunch, this Court has said that it will not give the advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.059" offset="2016611">Perhaps the outstanding example in the early history of this Court and it is said out in one of the great opinions for this Court is the reply of Mr. Chief Justice Jay to President George Washington who had called upon this Honorable Court for legal advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.411" offset="2102084">The response is firmed, its accordance, its specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.874" offset="2123922">But in short, Mr. Chief Justice Jay informed the first President of the United States that this Court was in the business to decide cases and not to give advice, and it has ever been such from that day until this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.280" offset="2201558">Now, may it please the Court another one of the great constitutional principles with which this Court is here concern is the question of sovereign immunity, sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.678" offset="2259132">I respectfully ask the Court to turn to Page 115 of the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.938" offset="2288180">I believe the pages at that point are not in proper sequence but they are properly numbered, page 115.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.781" offset="2331544">Midway of that page begins a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.245" offset="2353382">The letter is written by two of the counsels for the appellants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.443" offset="2382117">That letter is addressed to the Legislature of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.636" offset="2414926">And what does that letter say?</text>
            <text syncTime="580.616" offset="2426838">Watch out Mr. Members of the Legislature if you do not reapportion, we will file a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.617" offset="2462887">Members of this Court ever see such a letter?</text>
            <text syncTime="592.926" offset="2476053">I never saw one before.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.147" offset="2484935">What does that indicate to the lawyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="599.681" offset="2503116">What does that have to do with the expert field of a lawyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="605.001" offset="2524432">Why it's a legislative matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.454" offset="2534254">It's a legislative matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.436" offset="2542090">Why was this letter not addressed to the Secretary of the State of Tennessee?</text>
            <text syncTime="615.175" offset="2565078">Why was this letter not addressed to the Attorney General of Tennessee?</text>
            <text syncTime="620.051" offset="2584618">Because there's no issue with those who had issue or with any of the other appellee mount before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.935" offset="2620144">The issue is with the Legislature of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.650" offset="2634982">What does that mean then?</text>
            <text syncTime="635.036" offset="2644490">It means that this is an issue not with these appellees before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.477" offset="2674270">It's an issue with the sovereign State of Tennessee, one of the biggest states.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.269" offset="2701437">Well, count me out, count me out, what are you going to do about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="654.004" offset="2720455">We are doing this, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.324" offset="2729650">We are in opposing the plea of sovereignty on behalf of the Sovereign State of Tennessee that it has not in its Constitution by statute or otherwise given its consent to be sued in the Federal District Court on a reapportion matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.860" offset="2807808">Does the Eleventh Amendment apply here?</text>
            <text syncTime="679.204" offset="2821183">If it does, what is its significance?</text>
            <text syncTime="683.325" offset="2837692">Well, I think surely on that ground alone that this suit, this appeal would have to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.791" offset="2871547">Now, may it please the Court, we come to another great constitutional principle and that is the principle of separation of powers, and that is mentioned only incidentally by the appellant, I wonder why.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.834" offset="2955766">Did they think it not applicable or did they wish not to bring it into the open?</text>
            <text syncTime="719.981" offset="2984291">It may be decisive of this case, it could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.823" offset="3007697">Now, what -- what about the separation of powers?</text>
            <text syncTime="728.828" offset="3019713">Well, this Court has said that the founders, the writers of the Constitution would not doctrinaires.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.232" offset="3057330">And I suggest Mr. Chief Justice and the members of this Honorable Court are not doctrinaires.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.192" offset="3089199">Let's look for a moment, a very brief moment at the declaration of independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.489" offset="3118352">Perhaps one of the greatest governmental indictments ever drawn, let's look at some of the counts in that indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.799" offset="3171641">What did the sign has say to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="770.469" offset="3186270">George III is speaking of, he has called together legislative bodies and places unused.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.204" offset="3233186">He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.146" offset="3257010">Oh, were the columnists concerned with someone mentally with legislative?</text>
            <text syncTime="793.866" offset="3279893">It seemed so, it seemed so.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.374" offset="3297865">Now at this point, may it please the Court, may I pause just a moment to respond to one of the appellants in systems at here that one type of relief in this case might be for this Court to remand the case to the Federal District Court and in substance do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.952" offset="3396190">What does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="824.322" offset="3401728">It means that the appellants would have a three judge -- three judge District Courts sitting here, eyeing 132 members of the Tennessee General -- General Assembly each seeing which will make the first move.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.467" offset="3482290">Is that the way this Government of ours operates?</text>
            <text syncTime="848.434" offset="3498172">Not under the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.564" offset="3510606">I suggest that we never reach that point, but what is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="857.335" offset="3533699">That's coercion and some of the newspapers of Tennessee and now editorials have said, "Yes, it's coercion and that's what we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.939" offset="3580197">That's what we must have."</text>
            <text syncTime="872.041" offset="3592526">Is it true?</text>
            <text syncTime="872.951" offset="3596184">Is it so?</text>
            <text syncTime="874.868" offset="3603916">If this Court will take one defends, a misdemeanor case, a felony case, and set aside the conviction because of a confession obtained by coercion, would this Court lend its sympathy to coercing a state legislative body where the rights of 3.5 million people were involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="904.619" offset="3722825">I suggest not, I suggest not.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.825" offset="3735677">What does that involve?</text>
            <text syncTime="910.064" offset="3744664">Does it involve the integrity and honesty of individual judges?</text>
            <text syncTime="916.651" offset="3770995">Oh no, oh no.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.976" offset="3780295">That is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.514" offset="3786459">It involves the integrity of the judicial refinement of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.114" offset="3832853">If this is a matter with which the federal courts are concerned, let the decree be in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.049" offset="3856572">Let it be executed simply and surely, and we, in Tennessee, have great respect for our Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.746" offset="3903384">But if this is not legal calls to be cut by the federal judiciary, we respectfully suggest that the federal judiciary should not undertake to suggest to the Tennessee Legislature or to come right up to its face and say, "Watch out!"</text>
            <text syncTime="970.052" offset="3984572">If you don't reapportion, oh, we'll see what it would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.202" offset="4005157">I do not believe that that is the American way.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.198" offset="4021144">It certainly is not the judicial way of handling controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.082" offset="4044758">What did Hamilton have to say on this subject of separation of powers?</text>
            <text syncTime="991.735" offset="4071299">And I invite the Court's attention to the federal released, Number 51 where Hamilton writing for the benefit of the people of the State of New York as to why they should adopt and approve the Constitution of the United States as proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.425" offset="4146113">Hamilton said this, "Ambition must be made to counteract ambition."</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.544" offset="4182580">And then he seemed somewhat self-conscious and his writing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.256" offset="4225421">And then he picked up again and he said this, "What is Government itself but the greatest of all are reflections of human nature."</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.769" offset="4267426">And then he defined what must be true now and certainly was then in framing a Government which is to be administered by man over man, you must do two things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.540" offset="5546590">But it seems to me that it has been a great deal of loose talk by the imposed and the Solicitor General as to whether the issue is here presented a political in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.250" offset="5609388">Are they political or what difference does it make if they are?</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.688" offset="5631122">If I may, I would like to assist the Court in putting that question in proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.722" offset="5663305">I might say that I hope that no judge ever seats on an Appellate Court in the United States of America.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.746" offset="5779393">But now, does that mean that the Court considered political questions and all political questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.339" offset="5809800">Is there a dividing line?</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.506" offset="5818472">Let's look at that a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.143" offset="5832997">What was the growth of the common law itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.078" offset="5852745">It seems to me if I understand that the political philosophers of Greek that the growth of the common law in England was political.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.683" offset="5907080">Politics of the very highest tide did not the courts of England developed the law merchant from the customs in the commercial world?</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.323" offset="5961728">Indeed, they did, legal history shows and what was that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.496" offset="5982417">That was the action, the relation, the interaction of people in a society, oh yes, political.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.006" offset="6020451">Now, what else do we find in the common law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.398" offset="6034035">Well, negligence for instance, should a husband's negligence be imputed to his wife?</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.736" offset="6067367">Oh, what -- is that statutory?</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.849" offset="6075831">Isn't that common law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.896" offset="6083981">The interaction, the relations within a family, political, yes, must there be consideration for a contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.697" offset="6115224">All of those things grew up in the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.918" offset="6132046">They were political.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.664" offset="6139047">They were political in some sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.563" offset="6146675">And then we come to the land of cases upon which the appellants rely in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.364" offset="6173842">Nixon against Herndon, Terry against Adams, and those cases have been waived like banners in the briefs and before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.760" offset="6215429">Political right, yes, the right to vote, personal political right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.110" offset="6236850">And this Court has held time and time again that that is a right which can be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.301" offset="6269555">Now, where does this Court draw the line?</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.172" offset="6285124">Where does the federal judiciary draw the line?</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.981" offset="6296304">Is it not at the point where a matter is to be performed by another branch of the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.123" offset="6332876">Is not that one of the dividing line?</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.531" offset="6346564">Is it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.174" offset="6353042">The President of the United States of America is under a constitutional duty to see that the laws of the United States are being faithfully executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.593" offset="6402779">Are the income tax laws in the State of New Mexico being enforced?</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.379" offset="6429947">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.170" offset="6437052">Would this Court inquire into it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.288" offset="6449591">I suggest not and yet, that is a constitutional duty of the executive branch of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.400" offset="6481983">Now, this Court in the Pacific Telephone case cited in the briefs held that in the case of this time, the dividing line was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.456" offset="6534228">Is the attack made on the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.236" offset="6549379">For instance here is an attack made on any tax in Tennessee and they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.033" offset="6576546">The attack is made on the Legislature which enacts the laws, which provide for the collection and distribution of those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.716" offset="6623253">Now, we suggest, may it please the Court, that we referred to Coleman against Miller just a little bit a go, that is a great case and that case, Mr. Justice Black wrote a separate opinion not on the subject covered by Mr. Justice Frankfurter but on the question of, "What is a political question?</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.695" offset="6731191">What is a political question?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.120" offset="6740908">And in that opinion, Mr. Justice Black said in substance this, "A political question is a question which must be left to the political department who has the duty with which the subject matter is concerned."</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.554" offset="6826590">And in making that statement, he cited two cases which the appellees have cited in their briefs.One is the Pacific States Telephone case and the other is Luther against Borden, both involving the question of what is a Republican Reform of Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.374" offset="6913944">Now, may it please the Court, there is a question here as to what the analyst of these appellees is or -- the appellants, what use do they have here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.787" offset="6971517">Is it a legal interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.496" offset="6982384">What if the case involves individual voting, I suggest that the appellants do have a personal view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.589" offset="7022717">If this case involves the reapportionment of the Tennessee legislative, I suggest that the rights which these appellants claimed are the same as the citizens or all other citizens in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.144" offset="7088964">Now, may it please the Court, a question not previously mentioned I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.502" offset="7114355">In the United States, we have room, tolerance for all religious view, racial views, opinions of all types.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.302" offset="7153643">Suppose a citizen in Tennessee went into the Federal District Courts to complain of over representation, over representation, might he not do so?</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.786" offset="7215501">If the courts can hear cases on under representation might they not hear cases on over representation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.056" offset="7252595">We submit and most respectfully that this is a case, a gets the state of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.073" offset="7280703">It is a case with which all the citizens and voters of Tennessee are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.192" offset="7313199">We suggest that under the holdings of this Court that these appellants cannot maintain action of this type, political, yes, but on the other side, they lack.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.548" offset="7526567">Now, it may please to Court, of course one of the crucial questions in this case, one of the decisive issues is whether there is any federal rights here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.647" offset="7582992">Stated simply and I believe fairly, the issue is presented by the appellant in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.820" offset="7619668">It's a personal individual right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.205" offset="7633251">It involves the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.392" offset="7645999">It is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.677" offset="7663135">Now, I suppose it is the man individual right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.416" offset="7674107">Suppose it doesn't concern the right to vote but concerns legislative representation, is it protected with the Fourteenth Amendment, is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.706" offset="7715171">How has this matter then presented to this Court in this case and in the other cases as a Fourteenth Amendment case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.485" offset="7754355">Why just this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.793" offset="7759579">And it's so simple that it's almost alarming if -- if I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.794" offset="7783612">It said that where you vote for Congressman or United States Senate that that ballot must be put into ballot box and that that ballot must be counted, and reliances had upon two cases, United States against Classic, United States against Saylor, both sound dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.324" offset="7877653">What were those cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.932" offset="7888102">Indictments in criminal cases and what was the advancement, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.408" offset="7914015">Well in the vernacular, it was stopping the ballot box, stopping the ballot box, sound cases of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.204" offset="7953199">Now, it said because of the decision of this Court in those cases, that it follows that a citizen in one of the 50 States or in all of the 50 States of the United States held the right to have equal representation in a State legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.060" offset="8048598">What about the expert field of lawyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.272" offset="8065526">Does it follow?</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.922" offset="8316092">I leave it with this Honorable Court, I suggest in most respectfully that those cases sound as they are do not support legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.766" offset="8363426">Now, may it please the Court, may I speak as to this proposition of discrimination in the event that this Court should find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.161" offset="8413059">And I do not see how it possibly can but in the event that it finds that this is a matter, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court must find, I take it, under the insistence of the appellants that there has been discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.473" offset="8498322">I don't know -- I -- I -- seriously, truthfully, I do not understand how they can say that this discrimination, it would exist, is purposeful and systematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.875" offset="8551926">They don't say any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.668" offset="8563106">They say it's due to the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.714" offset="8579302">It's due to shifts in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.150" offset="8592990">And may it please the Court in Tennessee, we not only have the passage of time, we do indeed have shifts in population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.838" offset="8627785">Within the past 25 years, there has been constructed a multiple system of dams by the Tennessee Valley authority, a great nuclear installation at Oak Bridge which 20 years, the goals is -- the top of -- of a ridge out in the mountains and hills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.502" offset="8714407">Surely, that is purposeful and systematic discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.172" offset="8741052">Now, this Court said in Snowden against Huge where such terms were used willful and malicious discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.408" offset="8778041">And this Court said that doesn't add anything to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.811" offset="8795596">That doesn't add anything to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.712" offset="8803224">You still must look to see what brought it about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.962" offset="8820255">And so we suggest, may it please the Court, that there is not and there cannot be any purposeful and systematic discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.468" offset="8862260">Now, what about the injury alleged in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.239" offset="8877307">And I take it that the courts generally are not concern with discrimination unless there is some major.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.939" offset="8908131">What is the anxious here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.321" offset="8917640">It's a void that there is an inequitable distribution of textbooks in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.342" offset="8961735">And I want to take just a very few minutes and explain to the Court if I may what has happened in the State of Tennessee that brings this complaint about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.209" offset="9013248">Tennessee's count is range in size from some half million or more to 3000, 3500 people out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.188" offset="9061104">Gasoline tax funds, sales tax funds must be used with state purposes and of course distributed in part among the counties of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.587" offset="9114708">Now, whenever this subject is brought up in Tennessee and my friend's adversaries here will bear me out on view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.357" offset="9153787">Whenever this subject is brought up in Tennessee, what is said?</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.458" offset="9170192">Shelby County, half million people them all paid so much into the State Treasurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.830" offset="9203733">What's on the (Inaudible)?</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.124" offset="9212928">Van Buren County, Tennessee about 3000 people and I may say it to the -- to the members of this Court that Van Buren County lies almost out of the middle Tennessee, almost into East Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.030" offset="9296520">The beauty of it is almost unbelievable, the valleys, the hills, the mountains, it's a mountainous camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.073" offset="9332673">And there's the trouble with Van Buren County, how do you make a living on the side of the mountain?</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.370" offset="9365901">Well, you must make a living before you can pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.076" offset="9384709">Those citizens in Van Buren County are energetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.780" offset="9403517">They are progressive, they have small industries, they have small funds but I was distressed to line just before coming here to argue this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.559" offset="9446672">Van Buren County has been classified by the Federal Government as a depressed area, a depressed area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.760" offset="9479481">I regretted to hear that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.608" offset="9486796">Now, how do you pay taxes to maintain school in Van Buren County?</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.554" offset="9518561">Well, you do the best you can, and then you get what money you can from the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.383" offset="9549908">And remember, it is a sovereign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.673" offset="9563073">It is just a group of municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.737" offset="9575299">It's one of the sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.697" offset="9587210">Now, the complaint is made and that's what the proof would be in this case, if it's in Van Buren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.570" offset="9622632">You are sending too much money to Van Buren County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.122" offset="9644889">Now, may it please the Court, what is the Legislature of Tennessee?</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.935" offset="9664115">What is the Department of Education of Tennessee trying to do in Van Buren County?</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.499" offset="9690342">Is it trying to give those mountain boys and girls an education so that they may come here to this great national gallery and with painting about Renoir or Van Gogh?</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.145" offset="9741019">Is it that they may have that foolish appreciation of Beethoven's greatness owned as desirable as that might be?</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.546" offset="9770590">Is it that they -- they may be equipped to make a living?</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.118" offset="9784905">Well in Van, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.408" offset="9793996">But, may it please the Court, what the State of Tennessee would like to do for these children, is to give them education and make them aware about democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.657" offset="9843001">Make them aware of the type of life we live in the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.221" offset="9869228">Oh, the municipalities say, “We cannot do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.995" offset="9888350">We entitle the more money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.757" offset="9895455">Is this the urban view point?</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.149" offset="9909039">The municipalities want in the Legislatures of the United States of America, God forbid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.671" offset="9943103">Now, may it please the Court, how is -- why is it that at the varied time, the United States of America is concerning itself with parody, not only materially things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.287" offset="10009558">We say as I understand it, we want other people, other cultures and other lands to know about our democracy, to know about our way of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.598" offset="10062744">Well, I've delivered children in Van Buren County entitled to it too, and Tennessee is fine to give too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.926" offset="10100151">What does this Court say and I believe one member of the Court mentioned the adjournment of Congress a few days ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.178" offset="10133065">They do agree on certain legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.665" offset="10151037">Do you know, may it please the Court, that the mighty mayors of this mighty cities of Tennessee, while the federal aid the education bail was pending, that they was standing almost in a trance without stretched hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.336" offset="10225748">Let us help some of the education money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.574" offset="10242675">And where is it coming from?</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.396" offset="10253960">Tennessee?</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.315" offset="10261692">Oh, must -- it must be some other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.473" offset="10274335">Tennessee doesn't have that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.774" offset="10287501">How can they say as an injury in this case that the children of Van Buren County are not entitled to an education while they themselves are seeking these enormous bonds from the Federal Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.116" offset="10356882">May it please the Court, I suggest to this Honorable Court, that the question here presented is the broad question of the lack of Republican Form Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.476" offset="10422293">I also suggest, may it please the Court, that it is not primarily a legal method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.001" offset="10452386">I suggest that it is one of the ills of our Democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.789" offset="10479553">What has this Court said?</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.411" offset="10498048">In the great case Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube against Sawyer, decided lefts in a decade ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.437" offset="10530126">In that case, whether then the Pressman sought to take over the steel industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.671" offset="10551129">Mr. Justice Douglas said this in substance, “We pay a price for our system of government and indeed we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.889" offset="10591984">It is a price that today,” meaning on that day, “may seem exorbitant to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.129" offset="10624899">I indeed, we do fail the price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.224" offset="10637333">The failure to reapportion one of them, it may be, it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.681" offset="10663142">In the same case, Youngstown Tube and Steel Case, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said this in subject, “A constitutional Democracy like ours is perhaps the most difficult of man's social arrangements to manage success.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.016" offset="10748510">Is it not true, and yet we fight the wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.535" offset="10766587">We give life in order to maintain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.442" offset="10786126">What did this Court say in Colegrove against Green and that case too has been batted around and waived in the briefs and here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.849" offset="10831788">In the majority of opinion in that case, there appears this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.336" offset="10857702">Throughout our history, the most glaring disparities have prevailed as to the contours and the population of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.067" offset="10908693">There were some three or four or five other opinions in that case, but I have fixed those opinions up and down and back and forth, no member of the Court then sitting took issue with that as such, and I suggest that no issue can be taken with them, it has ever been one of the evil of our Democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.385" offset="11021960">Now, in the Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube case, one of the great cases decided by this Court, it is also said not just suggested, it is said that the founders, the framers of the Constitution did not make the Supreme Court of the United States, the over sale of the entire federal establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.936" offset="11148184">I would like to amend that if I may by saying that there is no evidence or indication either that the framers intended to make the Supreme Court of the United States the overseer of the several states of the unions and that several establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.663" offset="11243060">Now, if this is one of the ills about moneys and the Court must decide their case from here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.237" offset="11285379">What is to be done about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.513" offset="11298440">How are reforms and a democracy brought about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.795" offset="11323622">Well, first I suggest, may it please the Court, that the wrongs must be real and not theoretical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.181" offset="11369075">They must be real enough that they are actually hurting somebody, his pocketbook, his mentality, his disposition?</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.183" offset="11413170">That's when the American people become aroused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.322" offset="11425708">What does history show?</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.577" offset="11434695">Is it true that the only thing that history teaches is that history teaches nothing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.555" offset="11462593">What about the rights in Magna Carta?</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.295" offset="11473565">They want theoretical work, oh no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.550" offset="11490597">Well what about these rights in this -- in the indictment here, the decoration of independence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.389" offset="11509927">They weren't theoretical, oh, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.835" offset="11523720">The rights determined by the immense patience proclamation were not theoretical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.064" offset="11544618">When rights become concrete, when citizens are concerned with those rights, they will enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.982" offset="11576278">Now, how do you enforce democratic rights, political rights in a Democracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.758" offset="11615462">Well, traditionally it's done it ballot box.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.631" offset="11634897">The people must be educated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.769" offset="11643465">They must be interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.460" offset="11654228">They must want to do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.986" offset="11668334">Now, may it please the Court, it said in this case, it said in this case, that the appellants have no way of getting any help of any kinds, any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.217" offset="11729251">I don't believe the members of this Honorable Court will accept that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.173" offset="11753075">Isn't it strange that that has never to this date, then a campaign for the Office of Governor in the State of Tennessee where real apportionment was an issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.362" offset="11821829">Where do people present that issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.352" offset="11833846">They present their issues through persons who are candidates for statewide offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.014" offset="11864461">No candidate for any statewide office particularly the Governor of Tennessee has ever made that, a plank in his place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.491" offset="11910332">It may happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.559" offset="11918587">And when it does, the Legislature of Tennessee may take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.252" offset="11937395">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.204" offset="11949202">Is it not necessary in a Democracy of outside that this political views, they hand for the political process?</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.040" offset="11992566">And I want to recall briefly if I may Mr. Chief Justice, as to an instance that occurred in 1953, Tennessee's Constitution had not been amended for 80 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.956" offset="12052229">The citizen said we think that it should be amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.497" offset="12070410">The Legislature authorize that the question be submitted to the people as to the vote, whether they wanted a constitution event, and then what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.797" offset="12119625">That question was talked up and down, the life and breathe of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.137" offset="12144912">It was discussed on the radio, through the newspaper by editorial and in my home City of Chattanooga.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.567" offset="12178662">I know and this is a matter of rapid, may it please the Court, groups were formed, representatives of labors thereon, representatives of industry, representatives of a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.370" offset="12249924">Tennessee voted for that constitutional convention and it was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.955" offset="12268210">And one of the amazing things is the way and mainly in which that convention was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.219" offset="12293287">What did Tennessee do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.783" offset="12303527">Well, I'd say this first, that in choosing its delegates to that constitutional convention, that first in 80 years, it didn't go to the (Inaudible) around the City Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.158" offset="12381059">Who composed that convention?</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.589" offset="12402792">Former governors, former congressmen, school teachers, college professors, farmers, businessmen, some of them I suggest, the majority of them had never offered themselves at the ballot box in any type of allege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.074" offset="12488683">Most of them never will again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.206" offset="12501222">They sought to serve thus thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.008" offset="12516477">Now, that constitutional convention did adopt some amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.758" offset="12539465">For instance, it increased the term of our governor from two years to four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.364" offset="12561826">It made some changes as to the way in manner in which the Constitution itself may be amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.977" offset="12588262">And this is an interesting thing and something that I think this Court should know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.196" offset="12609160">That constitutional convention was not concerned alone with Government at the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.516" offset="12638417">It was dissatisfied with Government at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.289" offset="12657539">Listen to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.518" offset="12666420">They said, "We think there should be some means of consolidating city and county from it, whether it'd be education or whether it'd be in all services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.771" offset="12723472">Now, what has happened under that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.495" offset="12734339">And I think this is material to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.388" offset="12745937">What has happened under that constitutional amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.698" offset="12767148">This past Legislature enacted a law, committing the people of the City of Knoxville and Davidson County to set up a charter commission, to write a charter, to submit to the people of the county and the city as to whether the county and city government should be consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.310" offset="12861607">And as I understand it Mr. Chief Justice, the result would be something like the Government of the great city of Saint Louis or the great city County of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.385" offset="12901940">And if I am not misinformed, that charter commission will meet tonight for another meeting in the City of Knoxville (Inaudible).</text>
