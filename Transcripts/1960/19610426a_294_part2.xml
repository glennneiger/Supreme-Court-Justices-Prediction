            <label>Mr. Robert L.carter</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- to the Court what had occurred in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.043" offset="131532">And I think that I got as far as indicating that the action which had been brought under the 1924 law in the state court had been declared void, at least the injunction issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.440" offset="205093">You will note that the -- the statute which is set out in the appendix in the appellants' brief on page -- setting out at page 43 and 44 that the District Attorneys are permitted to bring action against various organizations that violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.857" offset="298820">During the period, therefore, while the injunction in 1956 had been declared void, the various organizations and affiliates of the NAACP in Louisiana were fearful to function without filing a list because of Section 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.252" offset="372381">Therefore, some of them decided that in order to function at least at that point, one of them decided that in order to function, it would file a membership -- it would file a list of -- of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.725" offset="422222">Now, that organization that did that was in 1956 was the New Orleans branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.352" offset="468825">After 1958 or 1957, I think a few more organizations filed a list of their members, but it -- as Mr. Schuler indicated only 11 of 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.501" offset="517413">The rest of the organizations and affiliates of the -- of the NAACP in Louisiana were not functioning and were -- were not operating at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.963" offset="559208">In 1958, the second statute, which is before the Court, the affidavit statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.190" offset="596093">When it was enacted, we then brought suit in the federal court attacking the constitutionality of the new statute requiring the affidavit and the old statute on the grounds that they violated due process, equal protection and the First Amendment rights, insofar as they are included in the -- in the Due Process of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.544" offset="697553">That was answered, the Attorney General answered there and the case, nothing occurred until sometime in 1959 when the Attorney General then went into the state court and it secured an injunction against the functioning and operation of the -- of the organization on the grounds that it had not complied either with the 1924 law or with the 1958 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.245" offset="820328">At that point, we sought to go into the federal court on the grounds that this was a -- an interference with the jurisdiction of the federal court and we sought an injunction to restrain the -- the Attorney General from proceeding any further, since that came out, it was pending before the federal court and the federal court could handle and dispose of the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.464" offset="929207">It was then that the federal court consolidated the two matters and had a hearing on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.026" offset="959509">Now, if you will note the -- the order on the hearing indicates that the -- one of the things was that any information, evidence was to be by disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.585" offset="1001723">That’s set out on page 129 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.921" offset="1015097">And the federal court apparently was concerned about the fact that how many organizations had filed membership list and how many prosecutions had been taken by the Attorney General and specifically asked the Attorney General to give information as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.589" offset="1085733">And you’ll note that on page 1 -- 130, the -- and 129, the Attorney General indicates that he is unable to say how many prosecutions have been brought under the Act, this is since 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.193" offset="1152188">And he is also unable to indicate how many of the organizations are affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.115" offset="1903783">Still, I think that to weigh on the evidence as a whole that the court below had ample evidence in the -- in the newspaper reports and so forth, to indicate that this -- to -- to believe that this was a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.217" offset="1956237">Now, I must say that insofar as the question that Mr. Schuler has brought here about the -- in answer to a question from Mr. Justice Frankfurter about the -- the District Court rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.052" offset="2867597">And therefore, before there is a permanent injunction in this matter, we would want to have eye witnesses and testimony from persons to go into the question as to whether in fact what has been alleged here in the affidavit form was correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.809" offset="3446575">We didn't raise it because what occurred was that we were concerned about the statute requiring us as an organization, to file a membership list and it's an impact on us.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.014" offset="3587427">Yes sir, because we have not gone to this, the -- the -- as I understand the judgment below, the judgment below does not hold that this statute -- that this 1924 law is just -- is -- is bad completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.004" offset="3635388">It holds that the law is bad insofar as it requires this organization to file membership list and that the 1958 law is bad insofar as it requires the organization to file the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.538" offset="3697560">Now, we think that -- as I say I have a personal opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.786" offset="3722533">The statute is unconstitutional on its face, but we did not raise it and I don't think it's the precedent before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.626" offset="3749909">Insofar as the 1958 law was passed, I -- is enacted -- in our judgment, this goes against all the rules of -- of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.214" offset="3796198">The -- an individual, a member of the organization -- in a local organization, an officer is required to file an affidavit as to somebody else's act and he is punished if in fact what someone else has done over whom the State has no control, if he isn't indicated something that's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.653" offset="3894000">Now, one final point and I only make this because the appellants have raised it in their brief on several occasions and Mr. Schuler raised it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.306" offset="3944573">There seems to be some feeling in the -- by the State that the 1924 Act could've been interpreted as applying to us as being applied to officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.782" offset="4002461">I like to point out to the Court that it doesn't seem to me unless the court below would require to rewrite the law, that it could pick and choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.420" offset="4049063">There is nothing in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.777" offset="4054497">The Act says that the membership -- a list of members and officers shall be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.106" offset="4075813">The -- there's no separation here with respect to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.556" offset="4089605">And what the District Court held was that the act could not be applied to the -- this organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.000" offset="4119385">Now, what -- what I gather, the State is apparently arguing is that the District Court could have rewritten the law and have therefore state the part of it and said that the law with -- could be required to apply to officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.689" offset="4190124">But I don't think that that can be done here unless the -- the District Court goes into the business of becoming the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.093" offset="4215724">So this -- for this reason, we submit that the judgment below is we think, correct and it should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.486" offset="4641311">It has never been in a position of being an innocuous destitute since 1924 to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.706" offset="4674226">In 1950, in the State of Louisiana, all of our statutes were revised under legislative mandate by the Louisiana Law Institute which is our official body, the very good features of this statute, the deterring effect that it had and cause increase in tranquility in our State among everybody was so well recognized that it was put in back to the revised statutes under its present title of Title 12, Section 401 to 409.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.585" offset="4809749">Insofar as prosecutions under the statute, I know personally of no criminal prosecutions or I've been in the Attorney General's Office for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.632" offset="4865860">I've never heard of any criminal prosecutions under this statute either of a member of the NAACP, the Ku Klux Klan, the St. Vincent de Paul or anybody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1270.732" offset="5186330">On page 5 of their brief, evidence disclosed in the 1950 and 1951, no organization had filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.171" offset="5224051">In 1952, 1953, 1954 and 1955, only a few filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.046" offset="5251532">Now again, Mr. Chief Justice, I think you asked this question and I'm answering it from their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.888" offset="5278908">Approximately 1000 such lists were filed in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.235" offset="5300328">So there must have been 1000 organizations in our State that complied with 1956, 2000 in 1957, 1000 in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.668" offset="5346095">Now, the way the statute is written, you have to file this list no -- no earlier than December the 15th and no later than December the 31st, which accounts for that drop of 500 in 1959, because the whole year had not yet been completed and there was a no-necessity and no-requirement for a filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.707" offset="5434180">Some organizations do file late.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.743" offset="5450376">Now, again, reading from their own brief, "A total of 12 NAACP affiliates," and that's born out by the record, "filed a list of members with the Secretary of State in 1957."</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.746" offset="5510353">That's after this suit was filed back on March 1st, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.678" offset="5530102">They're not scared of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.865" offset="5534804">There's no fear of reprisals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.316" offset="5544626">They're still filing lists, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.242" offset="5556328">They're basing this that the whole thing is on the fear of reprisals, a fear of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.918" offset="5583078">There was no such fear in their minds at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.450" offset="5593213">All these came up after 1958, after the NAACP placed this Alabama case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.352" offset="5620799">And also I think, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, asked the question as to whether there was any announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.576" offset="5649638">You will find the affidavit of our present Attorney General on page 133 of the record that the petition is herein, any branches affiliated therewith, are the sole organizations in the entire State that have failed and refused to comply with the law after being advised that it was necessary to so do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.128" offset="5735842">There was no contradiction in this record if that affirmed the positive statement of a public official who was supposed to be in his doing his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.678" offset="5770115">There was absolutely no contradiction why affidavit or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.341" offset="5788714">In addition, I think Mr. Justice Harlan asked a question if there was any reason given for what you might term a reactivation of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.653" offset="5838033">There could be plenty of reasons for that, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.003" offset="5859349">Right after the Brown case in Louisiana, there was plenty of talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.583" offset="5889755">That again is not in the record, but I'm only mentioning that in answer to the question that was prepotently to Mr. Schuler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.695" offset="5918177">There was plenty of talk all over the State of the reactivation of the Ku Klux Klan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.250" offset="5940328">That if you don't make the other points filed, why should we file?</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.273" offset="5956420">Now, as a result of that when the Attorney General called on the Ku Klux Klan, there gained as you'll see from the affidavit of the Attorney General, went out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.033" offset="6003545">And all we're trying to do in the statute is keep peace and tranquility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.069" offset="6023607">We're not trying to do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.460" offset="6033220">We're not having the exposure of a member just for the sake of exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.438" offset="6053073">I think our legislature is doing a proper thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.034" offset="6067493">I think out of the police power of our State, our legislature absolutely not only has the right but the duty to require all of these organizations to come out in the open and say who they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.766" offset="6122454">It is true that when they do that, it might have an adverse effect on certain of their membership.</text>
