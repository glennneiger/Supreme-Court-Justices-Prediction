            <text syncTime="18.433" offset="177089">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.166" offset="204048">Now, this case here is here, as a result of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.547" offset="237589">This is an income tax evasion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.793" offset="254516">As a result of which, the petitioners were illegally sentenced to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.551" offset="285550">It involves the tax returns of the Farnsworth &amp; Chambers Corporation, for that corporation's taxable years, 1951 through 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.501" offset="345422">The Farnsworth &amp; Chambers Corporation was one of the largest construction companies in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.852" offset="386800">It had several hundred employees and during the period in question, it did several $100 millions worth of business involving tens of thousands of separate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.082" offset="467675">The corporation was owned and controlled by Richard A. Farnsworth and Dunbar N. Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.677" offset="506128">Together, they controlled and owned 74% of the stock of the corporation and through a stockholders' agreement, controlled the balance of the stock which was owned by certain employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.607" offset="573837">The petitioners in this case among them, owned 7% of the stock at the corporation, which was subject to the stockholders' agreement and therefore, under the control of Richard Farnsworth and Dunbar Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.016" offset="651473">The petitioners in this case along with Richard Farnsworth were indicted in the spring of 1958 for aiding the corporation in evading its taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.663" offset="725974">Dunbar and Chambers, the other substantial stockholder, would undoubtedly have been indicted with this group, had it not been for the fact that he was killed in a hunting accident some months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.424" offset="793057">After the indictment was returned, the petitioners each pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.123" offset="823881">They then filed motions to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that it was insufficient and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.076" offset="855646">They also filed motions for bills of particular and they filed a motion to sever their case from that of Mr. Farnsworth on the ground that it was alleged that Mr. Farnsworth had diverted assets and income from the corporation to himself, whereas the petitioners have never been charged with profiting from the alleged wrongdoing, nor have they've been charged with personal income tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.808" offset="978631">It's purely the affair of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.701" offset="1002141">The Government supplied the petitioners with a token bill of particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.949" offset="1027218">It was vague and meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.503" offset="1037354">And the petitioners properly requested a supplemental bill of particulars, which was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.786" offset="2974490">I'll turn to the timeliness of the appeal, this essentially involves Rule 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.352" offset="3012733">In taking the case to the Court of Appeals, the petitioners meticulously followed Rule 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.234" offset="3044289">The motion, denominated motion in arrest of judgment was filed within four days after the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.996" offset="3075323">And within four days after the Court denied the motion in arrest of judgment, the notice of appeal was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.630" offset="3105938">In each instance, Rule 37 permits 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.493" offset="3121298">Permits 10 days to file a motion in arrest of judgment and permits 10 days to file a notice of appeal after a motion is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.652" offset="3157974">In each instance, the time taken by petitioners was much less.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.140" offset="3179917">However, it is the argument of the Government that under Rule 34, this motion in arrest of judgment was not timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.463" offset="3217220">Therefore, it was void and was of no effect under Rule 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.664" offset="3241984">But the answer to this is, one, Rule 37 merely states that if a motion in arrest of judgment is filed within 10 days after the judgment, then after -- you have 10 days after such motion is overruled to file a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.895" offset="3318993">It is not said in Rule 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.163" offset="3327979">The only rule which purports to be applicable to appeals that a motion of -- an arrest of judgment filed pursuant to its terms, must be timely under Rule 34, there's no reference to Rule 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.481" offset="3381269">Nor does Rule 37 say that such a notice or such a motion of arrest of judgment must have any other quality.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.178" offset="3560051">The second part of our argument is that this motion was timely under Rule 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.290" offset="3584502">Rule 34 provides that a motion in arrest of judgment to be timely under its provisions must be filed within five days after “determination of guilt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="883.065" offset="3635597">The Government would say that when the nolo contendere plea was filed here, that was a determination of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.301" offset="3664541">And they say the Third, Fifth and Ninth Circuits supports that view, but these decisions do not support that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.779" offset="3698500">Each of those cases concerned verdicts of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.303" offset="3712606">None of them concern nolo contendere pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.002" offset="3727339">The only prior decision, the only prior decision that we have been able to find that concerned a nolo contendere plea is a decision by this Honorable Court in the Sullivan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.118" offset="3779793">In the Sullivan case, we have facts very much analogous to the facts of the case before us today, with a nolo contendere plea and then a judgment following the judgment, a motion in arrest of judgment and then appeal to the Tenth Circuit and then certiorari to the Supreme Court.</text>
