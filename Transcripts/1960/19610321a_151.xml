            <text syncTime="13.999" offset="159326">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.496" offset="169357">This case and the Polaroid case which follows it, arise under the Excess Profits Tax Act of 1950, that's the so called Korean War excess profits tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.409" offset="217004">The taxpayer is a corporation engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of ethical drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.306" offset="252635">During the years 1946 to 1949, before the excess profits tax years, the taxpayer developed two new chemical compounds, one of which proved to be effective in the treatment of peptic ulcers and was sold under the trade name of, “Banthine”.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.094" offset="335705">The other was proved effective in the prevention and treatment of motion sickness and was sold under the name, “Dramamine”.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.596" offset="373739">In 19 -- during the years 1950 to 1953, which are the excess profits tax years, the taxpayer realized very substantial amounts of income from the manufacture and sale of these two products.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.484" offset="437269">It included that income in the computation of its excess profits tax for those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.116" offset="459839">Later, however, they filed claims for refund, claiming that a part of that income in sale of those two products was entitled to relief in part from the excess profits tax under Section 456 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.079" offset="531728">At the outset, I like to explain briefly what Section 456 really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.813" offset="558582">Section 456 is one of a wide variety of provisions ultimately designed to provide a more equitable measure of the income that should be subjected to the special war time rate imposed by the excess profits tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.506" offset="621380">Its particular profits is income which is realized during the excess profits tax years, but in fact is attributable to events or work done in prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.779" offset="678536">The clearest example might be income which was fully earned before the war, but was subject to litigation which was not resolved until after the excess profits tax was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.413" offset="729004">And I think there is good reason not to subject that income to the full burden of the excess profits tax, simply because it wasn't really realized until that time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="172.245" offset="792325">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.727" offset="794311">I will come to the precise definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.209" offset="800162">I'm -- at this point I was just suggesting the -- the general purpose of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.285" offset="824508">There are three requirements to qualify for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.449" offset="845197">I'm speaking again in broad terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.127" offset="863901">The first is you must have an eligible kind of income, income, an eligible class of income, income which is of a kind to which the section applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.798" offset="906533">The second requirement is that it must -- that class, the eligible class of income, must be abnormal in amounts, which is defined to mean in excess of 115% of the average income of that same class for the four previous years.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.973" offset="995244">Now, at this point, I think I can clarify Mr. Justice Whittaker's problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.370" offset="1012903">The statute in the definition of abnormal income first speaks of income which is abnormal in kind, income that is not normal for the taxpayer to receive and then speaks of income which is normal to receive, but which is abnormal in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.766" offset="1082389">Now practically, it is only the abnormality in amount that is important because any income that is not normal to receive will also be abnormal in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.253" offset="1120423">Such -- the -- the only real quantitative -- the only test that the abnormality test imposed is the quantitative test, but if you have income that is an eligible kind and which meets the quantitative test, then you have what is called abnormal income and the excess of that over the 115% average for the four or five years, less allocable deductions is the -- is called the net abnormal -- the net abnormal income.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.242" offset="1256364">Now you're not automatically entitled to relief for the net abnormal income.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.068" offset="1271620">The third step is that you must show that that income or part of it is in fact attributable to other years.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.873" offset="1314879">Now, if you satisfy all three of those tests, eligibility in kind, abnormality in amount and attributability to other years, then the relief that you get is that you reallocate the net abnormal income to the years to which it is attributable.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.028" offset="1387499">Now the significant part of the relief is the income that you reallocate to pre-excess profit tax years to prewar years, because any income that you cast back to those years, escapes the excess profits tax entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.268" offset="1448417">Now, the problem here isn't all that complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.548" offset="1461582">The problem in this case is concerned only with the threshold question, only with the question of the eligibility of the income, whether the income derived from the sale of these patented products, Dramamine and Banthine, which I omitted to say were patented, is income of the kind, which is eligible to qualify under the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.321" offset="1568684">Now eligibility is controlled by paragraph (1) and (2) of Section 456 (a) and all of my discussion will be about those two paragraphs and that is the one part --</text>

            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="415.816" offset="1766588">That is governed by paragraphs (1) and (2) of 456 (a), which is set forth at pages 24 and 25 of the appendix to our main brief, our big brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.573" offset="1821654">Now, paragraph (1) defines abnormal income as meaning income of any class described in paragraph (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="441.797" offset="1870555">That's the -- those are the eligible class of income, income of any class described in paragraph (2), so that the only eligible classes of income are those described in paragraph (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="452.412" offset="1912978">Paragraph (2), then lists four classes of income which are specifically described.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.740" offset="1946311">The one under which our taxpayer here claims to qualify is subparagraph (B), which includes income resulting from exploration, discovery or prospecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.145" offset="2007960">And his argument is that discovery as used there includes invention and therefore, its income derived from the sale of its invented products, Banthine and Dramamine, is income resulting from discovery i.e. the discovery of those two products.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.144" offset="2095940">Now I should add that there is an alternative argument which is made by the taxpayer here based on the last sentence of -- of paragraph (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="507.707" offset="2134183">That argument is made at greater length by Polaroid and in following case and I propose to deal with that primarily in that case and here, I would like to concentrate on the discovery argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.688" offset="2182144">The District Court entered summary judgment -- this is in a suit for refund by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.347" offset="2228746">The total claim of refund, involve about 4.5 million dollars in tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.432" offset="2245151">Only three of the four years were actually covered by the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.727" offset="2262288">The District Court granted summary judgment for the Government on the ground that discovery as used in subparagraph (B), does not include inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.123" offset="2311816">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that discovery was not used in the particular limited sense and could include inventions and remanded the case for trial to decide whether Dramamine and Banthine were actually discoveries though.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.883" offset="2390915">Now, subsequently, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in the Polaroid case expressly disagreed with the Seventh Circuit and First Circuit held the discovery was limited to the finding of mineral deposits and did not include inventions and it was to resolve that conflict that the cases were brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.602" offset="2473775">Turning to the interpretation of subparagraph (B), what discovery there means, I would like -- I would like to concede at the outset that inventions are in common usage very often referred to as discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.042" offset="2551515">I'm not sure that it conforms with -- with the best use of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.951" offset="2567189">I think the dictionary would support me that the best use of the term is to include finding things that previously exists, as distinguished from creating something new.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.589" offset="2641690">Yes, it is indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.268" offset="2648482">I think Webster's in fact, does distinguish between discovery and invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.026" offset="2671470">I -- I'm not relying on that distinction in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.181" offset="2680142">I am prepared that the -- that customarily, very commonly, the inventions are called discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.628" offset="2705847">I would like to point out that so is virtually everything else in common usage and if you gave discovery the meaning in its broadest sense as -- as used, it would mean that virtually, all income results from discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.629" offset="2769899">For example, not only does an inventor discover a new product, but a manufacturer discovers a new source of supply, he discovers a way to cut cost, he discovers a new market, he discovers the value of advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.581" offset="2833742">In short, in common parlance, discovery really includes any new acquisition of knowledge and I -- I think it's clear that you can't read it in this statute in that broad sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.720" offset="2886301">Now, in fact taxpayers here, although that they state their argument as the common ordinary meaning versus a strict technical meaning, in fact they recognize that you -- the word has to be limited because although they start there, they end up trying to suggest that discovery really includes only basic inventions and doesn't include minor inventions, which certainly is not in accord with common usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.934" offset="2999150">So they also recognize that, we have to give the term here some -- some limited meaning and the question really is which limited meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.158" offset="3036035">The Government's position is that discovery as used here in this statute is used in the well-defined and special sense in which it is used in mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.044" offset="3079502">Namely, this is one of the definitions included in the dictionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.874" offset="3102908">The original finding of a part of the vain or load, it has a fine requisite in valid location of a mining company.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.552" offset="3133628">So it's in the special use of discovery in the -- in industry that we contend is meaning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.202" offset="3160168">Now, I think I can prove -- I hope to prove simply from the face of the statutes, in the face of Section 456, that the term is used in that sense and does not include inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.967" offset="3211264">Now first, our point to the subparagraph (B), which says income from exploration, discovery or prospecting, now, those three words are all words which have a special meaning in mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.772" offset="3282422">It is mining that is the common denominator among those three words.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.618" offset="3297886">The only -- the only way you can explain putting those three words together is the relationship to mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.487" offset="3329337">And if we assume that there's any cohesion within this single class of income, I think it has to be explained in terms of the relation to mineral products.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.470" offset="3361207">By the way, when I say mining, I'm including oil and gas, and the extracting industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.080" offset="3387643">The second evidence I think, is the -- if one interpreted discovery in -- in subparagraph (B) to include inventions, subparagraph (C), would be superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.766" offset="3450441">Subparagraph (C) defines is another and separate class of income, income from the sale of patent, formulae or processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.071" offset="3491610">Now, if income from the use of an invention or patent -- patents formulae and processes are ultimately all inventions and if income from the use of them in manufacturing the product were included in class B as income form discovery, a fortiori income from the sale of the invention itself would be included in class B as income from discovery and there would be nothing left for class C, subparagraph (C) to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.986" offset="3615326">That -- that's the rhetorical question asked by Judge Aldrich in -- in the Polaroid case, but if there is a big hole and it tends for the big cat, need there be a small hole for the small one?</text>
            <text syncTime="891.888" offset="3670915">Now third is that from the express inclusion as an eligible class, but income from the sale of inventions, it can be inferred that Congress intended to exclude income from the use of inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.598" offset="3749804">That is nothing more than the inclusio unius, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.055" offset="3771643">The -- and there is a -- a fourth consideration which drawn from the face statute of the homogeneity of the classes within themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.365" offset="3832874">The importance of the classes is that you apply the quantitative test to each class separately, the 115% of the average test.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.326" offset="3876655">Now that means that all the items of income included within a particular class in the taxable year in order to decide whether their abnormal in amount, you compare them with all the items of income included -- belonging to that same class in prior years, even on the maybe different items of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.929" offset="3967039">Now, that comparison makes sense only if the items within a single class have something in common that -- that this homogeneity within the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.970" offset="4015208">Now, the inference I asked you to draw from that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.047" offset="4027538">If Congress intended to make eligible income from the use of a patent, it would surely have included that income in the class with income from the sale of the patent (i.e. class C) and not in the class which the taxpayer contends was income from the sale of oil wells and goldmines, which is class B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.422" offset="4137044">So from the face of the statute, I think that there are -- there is a great deal of evidence that discovery was here used in the -- in the mining sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.592" offset="4169749">Going beyond the statute, there's confirmation in -- elsewhere in the Internal Revenue Code itself, which where a discovery is used in provisions expressly limited to the mining industry, we set forth two of them in page 1 of our appendix Sections 105 and 114 (b) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.353" offset="4256789">I will mention here only Section 105, because I think that is really the more important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.885" offset="4282911">That limits the income tax on gain from the sale of mineral properties if, but only if, the value of those properties was established, “By prospecting or exploration or discovery-work done by the taxpayer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.074" offset="4375698">Now that provision dates back to 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.870" offset="4386879">It's been in the statute ever since then, with one very brief exception during the 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.067" offset="4411643">Though now, it's limited to gas and oil properties, it originally applied to all mineral properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.424" offset="4433063">The significance of that I'm -- don't like too much of it, but the significance is that those three words used together in combination, have been used together in companies for a long time in the patent statutes themselves, to refer to the mining industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.637" offset="4521880">Now that confirms that that is the common denominator and that is what explains the use of those three words together described as the single class of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.804" offset="4566601">Finally, what I think is really the most conclusive proof is the legislative history of -- of this particular provision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.583" offset="4633684">Section 456 present here, was taken directly and in large part, verbatim from Section 721 of the Excess Profits Tax Act that was in effect during World War II and the only significant change in the paragraph (2) in two provisions was in the description of the classes of income now covered by subparagraphs (B) and (C).</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.417" offset="4896998">The -- you will see the first provision quoted is the provision that appeared in the World War II law as class C.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.556" offset="4937644">That included as knowledge per class of income, income resulting from exploration, discovery, prospecting, research or development of tangible property, patents, formulae or processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.253" offset="4996368">That provision expressly included the very kind of income that is involved in this case, income resulting from research and development of tangible property and also it included income resulting from patents by use as well as by sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.974" offset="5071287">So the income involved here would -- was expressly included in the World War II law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.227" offset="5096260">Now, the changes and as I say, this is the only significant change made in this paragraph of the two provisions, that class was broken down into two classes which found -- which are now classes B and C and part of it was omitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.761" offset="5170448">I was -- the two classes taken from its former single class are B, income resulting from exploration, discovery or prospecting and C, income from the sale of -- of patents, formulae, or processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.033" offset="5239515">The omissions are the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.942" offset="5251114">What was omitted was -- was the phrase research or -- research or development of tangible property and in addition, income resulting from patents, formulae and processes was limited to income resulting from the sale of the patent itself, not the use of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.460" offset="5321226">Now, it seems to us that if that departure was purposeful and necessarily very purpose was to exclude the kind of income involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.447" offset="5365112">And the Committee Reports -- the Committee Reports expressly say that that was the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.046" offset="5387577">The House Reports which was repeated verbatim by the Senate is set forth the next page of our reply brief on page 12 and you will see that after stating that the World War II law had -- may -- included as eligible -- eligible class of income, income resulting from the sale of tangible property arising out of research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.375" offset="5500844">The report notes that that provision was a potential loophole of major dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.711" offset="5526235">And that it was being omitted from the classes of income for which this relief was available because there appeared to be no means of restricting such an adjustment to truly meritorious cases without undesirably broad degree of administrative discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.025" offset="5615470">My -- my point is simply that that -- this is the very kind of income that was specifically included in the World War II law and just as specifically deleted from the Korean War law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.915" offset="7219075">Now, obviously that is not all income, which is attributable to the development of this item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.951" offset="7243212">No doubt that it -- some of it is, we don't deny that and that depends on how good a patent is and how great -- how much the monopoly that is -- is given by the patent is worth, but certainly, they at least also made ordinary manufacturing profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.515" offset="7313429">I suggest the failure of a taxpayer to be able to suggest how you breakdown your sales income between the patent and the manufacturing and other activities, simply confirms the wisdom of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.481" offset="7361285">And this is the administrative problem that caused them to delete that class of income in taking out a provision which would've required that kind of breakdown and I think ultimately there's no basis for construing the discovery provision in subparagraph (B) to recreate those problems.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter J. Cummings, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1844.878" offset="7482911">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.685" offset="7490121">There are two questions involved in Searle's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.122" offset="7499839">First is whether the District Court erroneously granted the Government's motion for summary judgment, instead of letting Searle prove that its Dramamine and Banthine were discoveries within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.248" offset="7540381">The second question equally important which I also ought to be able to cover, is an alternative one namely whether the District Court erroneously granted the Government's summary -- motion for summary judgment, instead of letting Searle prove that the income from these two drugs could probably be classified under the last sentence or on the clause of the statue and the regulations in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.079" offset="7627734">Under Rule 42 (b), to answer the question that Chief Justice put to Mr. Barnett, the remaining issues by court order have been held in abeyance, such issues as involving competition of amount of abnormal income, the years of attribution and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.024" offset="7687502">The facts are largely in dispute as the Government conceded in the District Court but some of them are disclosed by the error record that's before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.290" offset="7720521">As to the facts established by this record, the record shows that Searle is seeking to recover part of the excess profits taxes that it had paid in 1950 through 1952, on income from the discovery of these drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.809" offset="7774647">Dramamine is, of course, the famous anti-seasick or motion sickness remedy, whereas Banthine, is an equally sensational remedy for the treatment of peptic ulcers, normally rendering surgery obsolete in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.641" offset="7837968">Searle advised the District Court that it intended to prove that unlike all it's other products, both these drugs were breakthrough discoveries, involving new compositions of matter and that their effect on the human body constituted an unprecedented approach to the treatment of motion sickness and peptic ulcers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.906" offset="7911006">Searle intended to show that the contemporary medical literature of other publications termed these two drugs discoveries for they were not mere improvements on existing drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.086" offset="7951757">Their large sales and widespread in the -- imitations were further indicia that both of these were genuine or breakthrough discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.860" offset="7990836">But in the alternative, Searle intended to prove at the trial that it was reasonable and appropriate within the meaning of the treasury regulations, to classify the income from these drugs under the omnibus last sentence of the statute, even if it should not qualify under subparagraph (B) in the discovery provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.921" offset="8067009">The Court of Appeals held that the word “discovery” as used in the statute does confine to natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.834" offset="8094699">During the three years in question, Searle's excess in income tax payments totaled about 19 million, of which the complaint seeks to recover about three and a half million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.117" offset="8139839">But the judgment below did not determine that Searle was entitled to recover any part of this amount and in fact under the complicated computations that Mr. Barnett had adverted to, the District Court might conclude that the plaintiff indeed was not entitled to recover the entire amount or any of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.015" offset="8211414">In this connection, the Court will be interested to note that only modest recoveries were allowed under the equivalent provisions of the World War II Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.772" offset="8242448">This Korean War excess profits tax act, which was repealed in 1953, accords special treatment to income resulting from discovery and other classes of income, if it -- it falls within the definition section of the Act and the definition applies to income, abnormal in kind or abnormal at amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.858" offset="8318830">Searle's incoming question, it contends is abnormal in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.835" offset="8342758">As its principal ground on the District Court, the Government's motion for summary judgment claimed that discovery does not include products prepared through research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.244" offset="8380374">The motion did not at all mention Searle's alternative claim or relief under the last sentence of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.000" offset="8411408">As to both of these grounds and in the teeth of the regulation, the District Court held that the plaintiff's income was not entitled a relief merely because it arose from research and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.400" offset="8452995">Our first point is that the ordinary meaning of discovery would include these drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.024" offset="8471489">Amphetamine sulfate was so termed by the Third Circuit in the Smith, Kline and French case recently and the salts for the treatment of anemia is so described by the Eighth Circuit throughout its Preon opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.468" offset="8517256">Interestingly enough at the famous (Inaudible) hearings, the investigation of the drug industry last year, important breakthrough drugs like these, were referred to as discoveries.</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.156" offset="8612028">The Tax Court also used the term discovery on a non-mineral sense, when it was dealing with the equivalent provisions of the World War II had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.485" offset="8653302">In two cases that I found and preparing for the day and are not in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.526" offset="8673468">In the W.P. Davis case in 5 B.T.A. 1195, the court referred the plaintiff's hosiery machine as a discovery and in Steel or Bronze Piston Ring Corporation in 13 B.T.A. 636, the court referred at the plaintiff's piston rings as a discovery, so the relief -- so that the word was used in a non-mineral sense by the Tax Court itself in administering the earlier provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.332" offset="8776704">The term is of course applied to really new drugs by common usage and there was so applied in the medical literature and the other newspaper articles dealing with these two drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.704" offset="8826232">Learned articles on such other drugs as insulin and penicillin referred to them as discoveries and as even Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Stewart noted, the Constitution of course, uses the term discovery in a non-mineral sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.445" offset="9941138">Because of time annotations, I won't be able to go into the legislative history except to state that in fact the only link between Section 456 and natural resources in the 1950 congressional debates or hearings or Committee Reports, was one remark by a representative of the mining industry quoted at page 70 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.460" offset="10029223">The brief significantly omits the next sentence which in effect states, “We, the mining industry probably won't need Section 456 for ourselves, but it is a good idea for other industries.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.106" offset="10083767">The Government has collected a great many statutes in its principal brief and appendix to show that discovery has a narrow mineral meaning here, but unlike the headings and text of all those statutes, neither Section 456 nor Section 721 its precursor, contains any heading or text showing their applicability was confined to the natural resources industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.923" offset="10175091">The same was really true on analysis we believe, for the internal content of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.452" offset="10197138">The language used in subparagraph (B) is exploration, discovery or prospecting, or any combination of the foregoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.798" offset="10226604">Each word then is given an independent significance, whereas the Government urges that discovery is covered only when in combination with exploration and prospecting in mining operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.123" offset="10267878">In other words, when Congress intended to limit discovery to no resources, it has always so specified and we've given many examples and so as Polaroid in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.044" offset="10307584">The main ground for the contrary opinion by the First Circuit was the application of the maxim noscitur a sociis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.693" offset="10342170">Well in accordance with many text writers on the subject of statutory construction such as Sutherland, this Court has often refused to apply the maxim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.540" offset="10381563">In the Russell Company case for example in 261 U.S. that company argued that the word, “contract” in a statute, had to be limited to private contracts because of it's word association, with the word, requisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.655" offset="10425971">Well, the Court included Government contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.972" offset="10439241">And likewise in the Stockholms Enskilda Bank case in 293 U. S., the taxpayer argued that the word, “obligations” must because of its word, association be confined to notes and bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.500" offset="10481351">Again, this Court refused to consider the adjacent words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.786" offset="10498487">As in both those cases then, the noscitur maxim should not be found to restrict the ordinary meaning of discovery, specially since the application of Section 456 to a discovery of this type, does inform that the basic purpose of Congress to give relief to have normal income which is attributable in part to prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.534" offset="10573511">To our knowledge, the noscitur maxim has never been used to defeat the purpose of the statute and the Government has cited no cases in support of applying the maxim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.423" offset="10613112">The only case cited by the First Circuit in favor of applying the maxim here was an 1877 case, in which its application was in accord with the basic purpose of the statute, but here the basic purpose of the statute would not be so satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.931" offset="10675075">If you aren't going to apply the noscitur maxim, you have to look anyway at the phrase as it was immediately derived in Section 721 of the World War II Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.998" offset="10723349">That's where this phrase directly came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.790" offset="10734529">And there it is defined as covering both income resulting from exploration, discovery, prospecting, research or development of tangible property, patents, formulae or processes or any combination of the foregoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.257" offset="10800358">So that applying the maxim, in the setting shows that discovery was not used only in the mineral sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.706" offset="10858245">Yes, but you have to see where the phrase was derived from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.077" offset="10871724">It was derived there and it's obvious that upon -- applying the maxim there, it could've been used in the mineral sense and just cutting out those other words, then suddenly turns, it changed the meaning of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.628" offset="10921880">Exploration is not confined to natural resources either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.774" offset="10938493">Its common meaning is to seek for or after or to examine and in the Keystone Brass Works, the Tax Court referred to Keystone's exploration in developing new bushings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.602" offset="10981752">In other words, the term was there used in a non-mineral sense, in the sense of preliminary investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.068" offset="11011636">The Government and the District Court relies specially on the elimination of the words research and development from Section 721.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.835" offset="11038699">And the proposed regulation provided for no relief whatever, if research and development were involved, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.572" offset="11065657">But that regulation was abandoned after protest in favor of the present regulation which takes the exact opposite position and states that Section 456 is applicable to research and development income if the income is otherwise properly includable within the class of income to which the section is applicable, thus, of course, including discovery income or income under the Omnibus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.114" offset="11163878">Congress has nowhere stated the products arising out of research and development cannot constitute discoveries and the regulation is finally adopted, so permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.504" offset="11201390">In other words, there is nothing to show that the removal of the words, research and development, was meant to confine the discovery language to the mining industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.677" offset="11246111">Speaking of loopholes as Mr. Barnett did a few minutes ago, researchers of course, have wider concept in discovery and although the World War II Act's inclusion of those phrases supposedly threatened to create a loophole no such problem is presented by genuine discovery, which is a rare phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.726" offset="11314239">Even under Section 721, recoveries were modest so that any loophole was at best potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.836" offset="11338689">In the light of the experience of the cases under the World War II Act, the Government's claim is unwarranted that millions of dollars would be jeopardized by affirming the holding below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.910" offset="11375052">After all the statute of limitations has expired, this particular statute was repealed in 1953, and the regulations themselves have very rigorous test so that there are ample safeguards for any so-called rate on the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.243" offset="11440358">As to discoveries, we think there need to be no administrative difficulties for income from the new product can be specifically identified and segregated as it was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.306" offset="11476616">Consequently, the reasons for eliminating research and development do not exist with respect to a discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.367" offset="11504828">The petitioners claim that discovery must not be interpreted and include patentable discoveries, but fear of overlapping subparagraph (C), but this assumes that the two paragraphs are mutually exclusive, they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.275" offset="11552475">The draftsmen understood that income might be quoting the draftsmen, classified and more than one of such paragraph -- subparagraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.692" offset="11586121">The language of the statute itself so states, in which case, the income is supposed to be classified under the one which the taxpayer irrevocably elects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.664" offset="11630007">In construing the statute, of course, the purpose of the statute looms very large and the main object of this statute was the tax benefits attributed to the large military budget and the wartime economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.944" offset="11683192">Neither those factors were involved with respect to Searle's or Polaroid's products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.273" offset="11704508">Section 456 was enacted to give relief whereas here, the profits are not attributable to military spending or the wartime economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.950" offset="11739199">As the Tax Court stated in the Ramsey Accessories case, Congress wanted these relief provisions to be applied sympathetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.635" offset="11773889">The House Report which was approved by the Senate Finance Committee so states, the House Report 146, the Report states, “Equitable considerations demand that every reasonable be -- precaution be taken to prevent unfair application of the tax in abnormal cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.566" offset="11845674">The weight of the burden imposed carries with it at the commensurate need for restricting its application to the cases for which it was designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.807" offset="11886634">Years of effort go into a discovery and its competitive advantage that will last on the short time and therefore, it's certainly within the spirit of Section 456 to afford relief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.506" offset="11937416">The discovery of minerals and the like was no more deserving of relief legislation than the discovery of vital importance to the health of millions of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.201" offset="11968136">And there is no intention on it at all of Congress to confine subparagraph (B) to the mining industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.340" offset="11996766">The mining industry was already well taken care of in many other provisions of the Code including certain sections of this very statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.672" offset="12034069">The essence of Section 456 is to recognize the unfairness of bunching for heavy taxation in one year discovery income which is in fact, attributable to several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.261" offset="12080462">Congress intended that abnormal income from discovery, if it can be shown to be attributable to other years, should be taxed accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.890" offset="12110973">All Searle wants is an opportunity to prove that income, in fact, was attributable to other years and it's consequently entitled to relief under Section 456.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.413" offset="12173040">In order to arrive at a solution of this problem, the District Court's order simplified it and said he would only pass on whether this could fit within subparagraph (B), the discovery provision or within the Omnibus Clause which I'm now about to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.394" offset="12240959">Our second point and then it is an equally important point is that Searle's and Polaroid's income in the alternative, constituted a special class of abnormal income under the last sentence of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.259" offset="12292368">That's a very short sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.980" offset="12299264">It appears at the middle of page 3 of our brief, the blue brief and states only, “The classification of income of any class not described in subparagraphs (A) to (D), inclusive, shall be subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.245" offset="12360391">One has to turn to the House Report on the World War II statute to see what the reason was for including an Omnibus Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.201" offset="12396126">And the same House Report Number 146 that I read from a few minutes ago gives the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.066" offset="12423607">It is stated there that “Experience with excess profits taxes both in the U.S. and abroad, has demonstrated conclusively that relief in abnormal cases cannot be predicated on specific instances foreseeable at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.139" offset="12475956">The unusual cases that are certain to arise are so diverse in character and unpredictable that relief provisions couched in other than general and flexible terms are certain to prove inadequate and that is why this catchall clause or Omnibus Clause was inserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.135" offset="12535933">The report goes on to state that existing law provides for adjustment with respect to six specific classes and the instant statute was reduced to four, received during the taxable year subject to the excess profits tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.458" offset="12589223">These specific items were allowed to be spread over the years to which they're actually attributable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.027" offset="12607509">Your Committee feels that the relief afforded by this provision should not be limited to these specific items, but should be available also with respect to any item of abnormal income as such income is defined in the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.474" offset="12653275">And then little later, enter the -- detailed discussions of the bill, they go on to the same effect to say that since the types of abnormal income cannot be predicted in advance, you can only grant adequate relief by extending the scope of this section and that's why this last sentence was added.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.386" offset="12828923">A taxpayer under this Omnibus Clause is permitted the group income in similar classes, as those specified in paragraphs (A) to (D) as are reasonable and appropriate and that is shown at the regulation at the bottom of page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.357" offset="12900812">“Similar” of course, does not mean identical or this Omnibus Clause would become entirely meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.033" offset="12927457">Again, one has to resort to a dictionary definition and “similar” according to Webster means, somewhat alike.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.814" offset="13254614">“Similar,” under the regulation in the setting, means that if a taxpayer classifies separately a readily identifiable segment of income, differing from its other products and attributed to -- attributable to prior years, such a class would be similar to the classes specified and should qualify for relief, if the other test of the statute and the regulation is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.316" offset="13348655">Yet, the District Court by its summary judgment would not permit Searle to meet the three tests established in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.644" offset="13373942">So it should not have been cut off by summary judgment from showing that it was reasonable and appropriate for it to group its income from Dramamine and Banthine in a separate class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.740" offset="13414379">Of all Searle's drugs, these were the only two that were completely new in concept and successfully performed in options and not previously performed by earlier pharmaceutical products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.935" offset="13455130">None of the other drugs marketed by Searle was truly new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.054" offset="13467564">In fact, this was recognized by the Government itself in 1955 when it rejected Searle's claim for refund of World War II excess profits taxes, because at that time, Searle had no new products as it's shown at pages 29 to 38 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.324" offset="13532662">At the trial, Searle would also to show that the income from these two drugs was attributable to prior years under Section 456 (b) and was abnormal in amount between the requirements of Section 456 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.912" offset="13586996">Thus, it would be entirely immaterial whether these drugs were produced as abnormal or routine part of Searle's business, which was the only test used by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.298" offset="13620537">Instead it's enough if it's abnormal in amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.887" offset="13646869">In its reply brief, it makes three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.098" offset="13655751">First of all, it states that it was inadvertently left in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.831" offset="13670693">Well that is not true, because the legislative history in 1950 shows that the House conferees insisted that it be put back in the statute after the Senate left it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.978" offset="13707264">The staff reported the joint Committee on Internal Revenue's taxation in 1950, acknowledged that the Omnibus Clause give relief to a fifth class, namely, quoting five, “Income of other classes permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.544" offset="13769540">Senator George made a similar statement on the senate floor, but this gave the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to prescribe classifications in addition to those prescribed in the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.332" offset="13808724">In other words, it could have been inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.060" offset="13819591">The Government also claims that the sentence can have no operative effect because the definition section, Section 456 (a) (1), is confined to income described in paragraph (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.461" offset="13869223">Well that gives a very narrow meaning to the word, described.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.491" offset="13881344">Instead described applies not only to the four classes specified in subparagraph (2) but also, of course, to the omnibus classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.969" offset="13919274">That's part of subparagraph (2) as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.218" offset="13936201">If you gave the narrow meaning to describe that the Government gives to it, the catchall or Omnibus Clause would have no effect at all, despite the fact that the House put it back for the very same reasons that was put in the World War II Act, namely, that would have been unfair without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.651" offset="14006000">Finally, the Government claims that the last sentence of the regulation under this Omnibus Clause means that income involving research is excluded unless it qualifies under one of the four classes listed, namely, A, B, C, or D, but the regulation does not so state at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.994" offset="14075382">The last sentence of the regulation applies to any class of income to which the principle of Section 456 and I'm quoting the statute of the regulation, “Is applicable”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.739" offset="14114356">In other words, the last sentence, the regulation applies to any class A through D or one selected by the taxpayer pursuant to the last sentence of 456 (a) (2) in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.847" offset="14178722">The reason for eliminating relief to research and development income also does not extend the income within the meaning of the last sentence for income is not entitled to relief under that sentence unless the three tests of the regulations are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.661" offset="14226056">In other words, you have to show that it's similar, reasonable and appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.674" offset="14250088">Also you have to show that the income is attributable to prior years under Section 456 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.479" offset="14277256">Thus, is it foolish to assert that if we prevail income abnormal in amount would automatically and suddenly qualified for relief, instead the attribution test at 456 (b) has to be met, the three tests of the regulation under the Omnibus Clause have to be met and many other requirements of the very rigorous regulations would still have to be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.042" offset="14371506">The District Court's holding that income attributable with recent surge has ipso facto excluded under Section 456, was certainly erroneous and in conclusion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed and Searle should be given an opportunity to prove that Dramamine and Banthine were discoveries within subparagraph (B) or if they were not, that the income was within the omnibus sentence, the last sentence of the section and the regulations there under.</text>

            <label>Mr. Isaac M. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="3693.173" offset="14876087">My secretary tells me that no matter how this case is decided, Mr. Barnett will win.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.900" offset="14910986">The issue in this case is whether Polaroid's income from this -- from two scientific discoveries is entitled to relief as abnormal income under Section 456 (a) (2) of the Korean War excess profits tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.730" offset="14970337">The Tax Court and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, while acknowledging that these discoveries were revolutionary discoveries held that no scientific discovery can qualify for relief under Section 456 and decided against Polaroid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.171" offset="15036061">Our contentions are similar to those advanced in the Searle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.163" offset="15052048">First that Polaroid's income from its scientific discoveries falls squarely within the class of income described in 456 (a) (2) (B) as income resulting from discovery; 456 (a) (2) (B) as -- as was explained in the prior argument, reads income resulting from exploration, discovery or prospecting or any combination of the foregoing extending over a period of 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.725" offset="15154239">Secondly, if it does not, if it's not entitled to come under (B), that such income was entitled to classification under the last sentence of 456 (a) (2), which provides for additional classifications by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.131" offset="15207946">And to get that again before Your Honors, that last sentence reads, “The classification of income of any class not described in subparagraphs (A) to (D) inclusive, shall be subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.258" offset="15260400">We contend further that a proper interpretation of the treasury regulations issued to implement this last sentence that under such an interpretation, Polaroid's income qualified for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.741" offset="15310346">Now the two scientific discoveries that were involved in this case, are the Polaroid Land Process and the Polaroid 3-D Synthetic Polarizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.009" offset="15347440">The Polaroid Land Process consisting of the Polaroid Land camera and film is a photographic system in which by one step dry processing, the developing and printing of the picture take place simultaneously within the camera, enabling the user to obtain a finished dry positive print directly from the camera within 60 seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.342" offset="15448691">Prior to the conception of the process, no photographic process existed whereby the picture was taken, the negative developed and a positive print obtained directly from the camera by a one-step dry process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.888" offset="15502921">The 3-D Synthetic Polarizer is the light polarizing material incorporated in the viewers, used by the audience in the viewing of three dimensional motion pictures to create the illusion of three dimensions and the exhibition of three dimensional motion pictures, could not have been undertaken without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.287" offset="15580557">That the -- our case differs with the Searle case in that, we already have had the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.061" offset="15599574">The findings of fact of the Tax Court establish that these discoveries were revolutionary scientific discoveries creating new odds and that the incoming question resulted solely and entirely from the discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.345" offset="15652760">We differ from the Searle case in another respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.492" offset="15665298">We have a stipulation in our case, in which the Government and Polaroid have agreed in the event that this case is decided favorably to Polaroid, upon the amounts of net abnormal income arising from the discoveries and upon the portions thereof to be attributed to prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.655" offset="15733948">So in answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, if we should win here, we do not have to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.230" offset="15756309">We have a -- findings of fact on -- on the facts that we have revolutionary basic discoveries and we also have a stipulation with respect to the mathematical answers under Section 456.</text>

            <text syncTime="3948.682" offset="15898102">I think that you'll find it in the patent laws, there is a distinction -- in the cases involving patented inventions, there is a distinction between a basic patent which advances the odd substantially and one which maybe entitled a patent, but it's merely an insignificant improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.735" offset="15978350">Now the court below seems to think there would be a large administrative problem connected with determining which is significant and which isn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="3992.920" offset="16075003">And in our case, despite the fact that we -- they've decided against us, both the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals said they were revolutionary inventions.</text>
