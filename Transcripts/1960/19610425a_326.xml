            <text syncTime="12.609" offset="153788">This case is here under Title 28, U.S.C. 1257 (3), petitioner having asserted in the courts below various rights, privileges and immunities conferred by the Constitution of the United States, particularly the right of petitioner, a Negro clergyman, to be indicted and tried by grand and petit juries from which members of his race were not systematically excluded because of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.951" offset="275205">Petitioner was indicted for murder in the second degree for an automobile accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.476" offset="305298">He was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree and received the maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.958" offset="339153">He applied to the -- he appealed to Alabama Court of Appeals, where he raised the jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.952" offset="375202">It was passed upon, the conviction was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.837" offset="390771">He applied to the Supreme Court of Alabama for a writ of certiorari, which was denied and certiorari was granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.488" offset="425357">The evidence in the case is succinct and uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.308" offset="444583">Dallas County, Alabama in which this crime occurred, according to the 1950 census have preponderantly a Negro population, approximately in the ratio of 8 to 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.845" offset="502784">I might say that the 1960 census figures are not yet officially available, but an informal inquiry indicates to me that the ratio is now approximately equal with the population being about 6.5 to 6 in favor of white persons. Nevertheless, the -- at all times, the population ratio was approximately 50-50.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.253" offset="604348">This is South Alabama, Mr. Greenberg?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="127.611" offset="613857">This is a county.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.282" offset="620544">Yes, it's about two counties West of Montgomery, near the Mississippi border.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.323" offset="648652">Despite the large number of Negro citizens, either a majority or very slightly less than the majority, only once in the entire history of the county has a Negro ever served on a grand jury in this county and this was five years ago, before the present Solicitor took office.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.800" offset="722526">The Solicitor testified on page 12 of the record and this is the heart of the case, how often are grand juries organized in Dallas County?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.605" offset="761814">Answer: twice a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.944" offset="771114">Question: And you have attended the organization since 1954?</text>
            <text syncTime="170.552" offset="785533">The answer is, affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.642" offset="789922">Since that time how many Negroes served on any grand jury in Dallas County?</text>
            <text syncTime="176.089" offset="807685">Answer: None.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.745" offset="814373">Did any serve on the present grand jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.567" offset="821687">Answer: They did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.503" offset="845406">The testimony concerning the one Negro who served a number of years ago was given by a jury member who testified that at time when he was on a jury, he did see a single Negro on a grand jury at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.117" offset="899845">Now, the court below held that the jury roll in this case, that is the list of names of prospective jurors, was based upon a foundation laid in the case of Fikes versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.329" offset="952717">The jury rolls in Alabama are a continuing document in which names are continuously added and struck, if they become eligible or ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.017" offset="991483">And that in 1953, according to the record in the Fikes case and we see this discussed on page 71 of this record, there were approximately 1500 names on the jury roll of which 250 to 300 were the names of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.474" offset="1053236">That is about one-fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.508" offset="1061386">Since 1953, names have been added to and dropped from the rolls and according to the testimony of the Chairman of the Jury Commission in this case, the ratio of 1 to 5 has dropped to a ratio of 1 to 12, because the number of Negroes has declined precipitously and this small fraction exists despite the fact that the population was approximately, 50% Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.772" offset="1182490">There are series of Alabama statutes which appear in the appendix to our brief, which set forth the method by which jurors are to be selected in Dallas County and -- oh, selected in Alabama, including Dallas County.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.784" offset="1250513">And these statutes Title 30 Code of Alabama 18 states, “That the clerk of the Jury Commission is to obtain the name of every male citizen in the county.”</text>
            <text syncTime="297.782" offset="1294503">Title 20 says, “The Jury Commission shall meet and so forth and shall make in a well bound book, a role containing the name of every male citizen in the county.”</text>
            <text syncTime="307.017" offset="1331388">And Section 21 which recites, “Qualifications of persons on the jury roll, refers to the names of all male citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="315.943" offset="1367124">Nevertheless despite the fact that the statute imposes minimum qualifications, it does not even require an ability to read English.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.474" offset="1397217">It explicitly says, that you need not be able to read English if you are a freehold or a household, you would need a -- need not even be a property owner or merely a householder.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.630" offset="1609853">The Jury Commissioners rather than selecting the name of every qualified male citizen of the County relied upon a system of personal inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.738" offset="1650291">And on page 35 to 36 of the record, we find the Chairman's description of how he went about selecting jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.525" offset="1697520">Well, I go to different parts of the county and know good men and ask them about folks and other Jury Commissioners have done the same thing, a good many I know personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.384" offset="1732942">And he then testified what do you -- where do you get the list from?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.775" offset="1746422">How do arrive at the names of those you're going to interview?</text>
            <text syncTime="413.184" offset="1756139">I talked to people, I know citizens, high class folks of various parts of the County and I can go by their recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.713" offset="1778186">We try to get good folks is the way we try to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.560" offset="1793651">And though he testified that he introduced Negroes and whites both, when asked for the names of some Negroes in the interview, he said he would decline to give the names, because it might embarrass them.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.057" offset="1839626">And on page 53 of the record, he testifies to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.061" offset="1859584">When he did not know Negroes in a particular precinct he said, he would talk to some good white folks in the County and some here in town.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.657" offset="1889991">That's on page 53 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.227" offset="1900231">The panels in this County consist of approximately 60 to 90 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.891" offset="1922905">Of -- of those 60 to 90, the number of Negroes has varied from about 2 to 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.745" offset="1942340">And this on -- testimony of the record by an average maximum of seven but I -- the general sense of the record is that 2 to 6 or 2 to 7 and sometimes, some might be found and some not -- might not be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.582" offset="1997720">In this particular case, of the five available Negroes on the panel, three were not found and 60% of them were not found.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.884" offset="2030947">Over the white persons available, a number also were not found at the exhibits on pages 25 and 26 of the record indicate, but that of course, was a much smaller percentage, nowhere near 60%.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.248" offset="2084342">It's somewhat in excess of 20% of the white persons were not found.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.878" offset="3502895">One of these gross disparities of a third and non-ending up on juries, or 50% as in some cases, the Court then says a -- the petitioner has met this burden -- has created a prima facie case and is incumbent upon the State to come forth with some sort of explanation of why this situation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.133" offset="3579904">Now, the State has in this case come forth -- come forth with an explanation and its explanation consists of we submit, an utterly meaningless statistic, that is 85% of the persons arrested are Negroes with an explicit disclaimer that this means that 85% of the Negroes in the County are arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.657" offset="3653987">Now, we submit, this does not meet the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.840" offset="3666735">It does not constitute any meeting of the prima facie case that we have made, that no Negro with one exception six years ago has ever ended up on a grand jury in this County.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.100" offset="3715741">I believe it was Mr. Justice Frankfurter in whose -- his opinion in the Cassell case, which has reflected the long line of opinions in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.085" offset="3755760">He said that if one factor is uniformed in a continuing series of events that have brought the past through human intervention, the law would have to have the blindness of indifference, rather than the blindness of impartiality, not to attribute the uniform factor demands purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.650" offset="3809991">And we submit that certainly that sort of case has been made here and that no evidence has been given to reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.594" offset="3833710">Moreover, we rely on Justice Reed's opinion in the Cassell case, an opinion which was not -- did not support the -- did not constitute the opinion of the Court, but the opinion of the four justices to the effect that when the Jury Commissioners rely upon a system of going out among their personal acquaintances of people that they know in selecting jurors especially in a county where there is a state statute setting forth minimal objective standards of that -- in a situation such as exists in Dallas County, Alabama, this is almost -- almost inevitably results in a gross disproportion such as we have found in this case and we submit that the State has not met the burden of -- of overcoming either of those two propositions.</text>
