            <text syncTime="27.645" offset="213974">There is some great disagreement between Senator Boothe and myself as to what the question presented in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.905" offset="243022">We have set it forth on page 5 of our brief, it is the green brief and I'll read it, because I think it is the controlling matter in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.834" offset="278758">The question as we see it is this, is a person, who is represented by counsel of his own choosing in a state court and who is convicted of a capital offense and sentenced to life imprisonment, entitled to have the court-appoint counsel upon request to represent him for the purpose of appealing his conviction in the absence of any allegation that he is a pauper or that his own counsel has withdrawn from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.466" offset="405191">It is important to note that petitioner has never, in any of the enumerable habeas corpus proceedings, in which he has been involved, alleged, stated, or suggested that he was without funds in April of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.683" offset="486066">He's never said he was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.208" offset="496201">Moreover, he has never made any allegation that any error occurred during the trial of -- of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.948" offset="535176">The record before this Court and before the state courts is silent on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.902" offset="566941">Moreover, there is no affirmative statement contained in the record on this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.377" offset="688880">The history of this case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.490" offset="697344">He filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond, that is equivalent to a Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.175" offset="732035">Judge Young, one of the three judges of that Court, appointed an attorney to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.649" offset="753977">The attorney looked into the matter and filed a brief of some type with Judge Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.807" offset="786578">In Virginia, the respondent, State Superintendent or the Penitentiary, by counsel, through the Attorney General of Virginia, cannot come wondering into the case until ordered by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.573" offset="893680">Then as was stated yesterday, writs of error in Virginia are discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.509" offset="913429">So, there's no reason -- we have no idea as to why the petition for a writ of error was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.242" offset="1108302">I could think of several reasons, one of which is this, and it's not in the record, it's immaterial but the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond had no jurisdiction than attain this suit, because there were facts not matters of record alleged in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.682" offset="1178102">And under Virginia law, a petition for writ of habeas corpus which alleges facts which are not matters of record must be filed in the Court in which the conviction was suffered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2451.926" offset="9911045">Now, it is perhaps valid that the State should have some type of procedure, whether it be a certificate of probable cause, set up as, I understand the Federal Government has something along those lines so that if a man wanted to appeal, an attorney could be appointed to at least investigate it and read some sort of determination as to the merits of his contentions or see if there is an error of the face of the record or even in the transcript, if there'd be one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.045" offset="13875597">-- try and answer one or two questions which have been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.997" offset="13887404">Well, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I have obtained Section 8-596 of the Virginia Code and very practically, it appears to me that the petition for habeas corpus could've been filed either before the judge, who entered the original judgement order or in the Circuit Court of Corporation Court of any -- of any or any judge of either in vacation in the county or city in which the man was detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.974" offset="13991267">Now, the Court of Law and Equity Part II in the Hustings Court, they have a pretty similar jurisdiction and -- and it seems to me that -- that the man was absolutely right in going to any court, any trial court, any court of record in the jurisdiction which he was -- detained which was Richmond City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.912" offset="14075068">And I don't believe that counsel will -- will deny that even though that's not shown in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.409" offset="14097011">Now, Mr. -- Mr. Justice Black asked a good question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.966" offset="14123238">Well, I'll -- I'll come back to that a little bit later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.733" offset="14134314">Now, I would like to very briefly touch upon this question again raised for the first time, not in the response, not in the brief that the man's not held under the order which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.316" offset="14176632">Now, this is the stipulated record and the order is at -- appears on page 10 -- page 11 as being the -- being a part of the record and we're now told that he's held under this record, under this order but under a nunc pro tunc order issued as a matter of fact, several years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.833" offset="14258657">Now, if that were a nunc pro tunc order and if it is in effect, what it says it is, then it takes the place of and it's substituted for this order and the man would be appealing from the same order changed only to add the name of the 12 jurors, which was originally wrongfully admitted from the -- from the first order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.214" offset="14348204">Now, this nunc pro tunc order actually, was started after this man in March of 1956, filed for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he had been tried only by 11 jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.472" offset="14401285">And then the State in November of 1956, more than three years after the -- the original proceedings proposed and -- and did have this nunc pro tunc order drawn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.007" offset="14455411">Now, one other comment I would like to make, Mr. Justice Clark, was referring to Judge Hoffman's opinion and the dates there I think, sir, that we could note it in the third paragraph in Appendix 4 of the State's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.958" offset="14515179">It said there that a few days -- that -- that the -- the judge did make up, I beg your pardon, it's not on Appendix 4, it's -- it's on Appendix page 2 -- in the appendix at page 2 of the -- of the State's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.303" offset="14592606">They said that, "While no transcript of evidence is available, a summary was prepared and signed by counsel" and Mr. Justice Clark, I mentioned that was his counsel at the -- who had been his counsel at the trial and who had not appeared from the time he made his motion to dismiss and from the time he filed his motion to dismiss back in 19 -- back in -- in April of -- on April 10 of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.245" offset="14708381">Now then, here in September, more than four months after that, when you couldn't have taken the case up, the -- Judge Hoffman says, the trial judge -- learned trial judge did certify the written testimony of three of the witnesses on the date following the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.576" offset="14781628">Now, I -- I'm sure this was done in good faith, but I mentioned those things, number one, to say, they haven't gotten any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.220" offset="14808273">They have no bearing on the case that we have before us -- this Court has before the other day and as a matter of fact, it does and I respectfully say to -- to my friend and colleague that because the case is so simple, because the issue is so simple, I do not blame him for trying to confuse this record by bringing in proceedings which have gone on since 1956 to date, covering 25 pages of his appendix and about a third of the main body of this brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3705.069" offset="14923630">Now, Senator Boothe, one of the things that isn't at all simple about this is the -- is the factual issue of whether or not, this man was an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.336" offset="14956753">He certainly does not allege -- did not allege in 1953 that he was an indigent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3722.194" offset="14992175">And on Appendix page 4, there is a very clear indication in the opinion of Judge Hoffman that the -- that a possible reason other than indigency and which is that he was dissatisfied with his trial counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="4273.471" offset="17197223">They are admitting when you seize upon and look at that question, that had he alleged he was a pauper?</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.606" offset="17229824">He would have been entitled to -- to have had counsel representing him on appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.972" offset="17263261">And winding up finally, I would just like to go back to the record, something from which we have won.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.505" offset="17293354">Again on page 27 and the able, scholarly trial judge who decided this very issue, which is now before the Court, the man from whose decision certiorari has been granted ultimately, said on page 27, "Whether an indigent defendant is entitled to the assistance of counsel on appeal has not yet been squarely decided by the United States Supreme Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.921" offset="17447058">An annotator says that such a decision in the affirmative would appear to be no more than a logical extension of the Griffin doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.543" offset="17485511">And then the judge, in a nutshell, places the case by saying whether this due be correct or incorrect is of course the question in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.589" offset="17533680">Now, there's your evidence, there is the record and there is the matter which was before the trial judge and which is before this Honorable Court today.</text>
