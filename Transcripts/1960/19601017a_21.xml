            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 21, on the docket Aro Manufacturing Company, Incorporated, Petitioners versus Convertible Top Replacement Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.386" offset="152952">Mr. Spritzer you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="15.608" stopTime="346.902">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="15.608" offset="165804">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.551" offset="177612">In the very few minutes remaining to me, I should like to attempt to restate briefly the propositions argued last Thursday and then to state concisely what we think is the appropriate test which should govern this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.492" offset="261308">My starting point was that we deal here with the combination patent by the convertible top assembly and that none of the individual elements, either the fabric, nor any of the other element, has been separately patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.839" offset="334764">From that, it follows that one can find infringement only if there has been an unauthorized creation or recreation of the entity, for that alone is the subject to patent taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.159" offset="411982">Now in this case, the court below found contributory infringement by the petitioner although the top fabric was supplied only for purposes of replacing worn out fabrics and not in any instance, for purposes of building a new convertible top assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.790" offset="502575">In support of its conclusion, the court below said that the fabric is sufficiently important, sufficiently expensive, sufficiently durable, though not nearly so durable as the cars hold, that a car owner would not rationally believe that he was making only a minor repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.035" offset="611558">Now, we take direct issue with this entire line of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.812" offset="630575">We urge that the patent on a combination does not give patent protection on unpatented parts, whether they be major or minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.980" offset="687313">And we say it further that any person reading the patent claim, which was filed in this case, was fully entitled to believe that he could repair or replace any individual component of the machine, when that component in ordinary course, wore out.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.747" offset="766412">I spoke the other day at the close of this Court's decision in Wilson against Simpson, which involved a combination patent on a planing machine and the Court in that case held that the cutting knives which were one element of the combination could be replaced as they wore out.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.029" offset="851466">And in so holding, the Court said "It is the use of the whole of the combination which a purchaser buys."</text>
            <text syncTime="199.184" offset="900159">Then the Court went on to say, that the purchaser may not be deprived of the right "To give duration to that which he owns or has the right to use as a whole."</text>
            <text syncTime="216.298" offset="968600">This Court of course, has followed that the same approach in other similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.299" offset="996603">The same view, we think, finds conspicuous support in decisions of the -- Second Circuit, although I must add that there are other lower federal court decisions which seem to adopt the approach similar to that adopted by the Firth Circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.050" offset="1091584">Among the Second Circuit cases on which we particularly rely, is a case called General Motors against Preferred Electric, which is particularly interesting in that, it, like in this case, involves replacement of automobile parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.534" offset="1173504">The patented combination in that case was on a circuit breaking system which was designed for incorporation into an automobile ignition.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.257" offset="1216449">The breaker arms and certain brackets which held those arms wore out and were replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.452" offset="1249155">The Court of Appeals said in that case that the breaker arm which had worn out was the very gist of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.700" offset="1282173">It then stated that nonetheless since the breaker arm was not separately patented but was one of the number of elements that the owner of the car could replace it at will, in order to restore the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.426" offset="1361063">And in still another Second Circuit case though not one involving directly the issue of repair versus reconstruction, Judge Learned Hand stated what we think is the gist of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.366" offset="1416861">He said, "The patent monopolist cannot prevent those to whom he sells from reconditioning articles worn by use, unless they in fact, make a new article" and I think that sums up the -- the test we urge.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.966" offset="1515186">We state -- say that true reconstruction means making a new article after the machine viewed as a whole has been destroyed or has otherwise deteriorated.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="365.803" offset="1566595">What do you say about the respondent's argument that -- that had been, is not the substitution of material here but that if the infringement is in the shape of the -- the distinctive feature of the -- this patent is the shape of this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.937" offset="1647156">I think that's what the -- that's the line that the Court of Appeals --</text>

          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="388.678" stopTime="435.311">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="388.678" offset="1658128">Yes, we say that even assuming that the -- the possibility that the material itself might've been the subject of a separate patent that it was not in fact a patent and no claim was made to a patent based on the shape of the fabric.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.369" offset="1728867">Therefore, we say that no more than a single element of a multi-element combination is being replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.121" offset="1767842">And at a minimum, we argue that replacement of an individual worn out part of a multi-element combination cannot properly be deemed anything more than the owner's right to maintain his property and to enjoy its (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="443.117" offset="1875884">They found that in some instances they were unattractive and in other instances they wore out and that the court put aside any question of the distinction between replacing it for reasons of taste and replacing it because its utility had completely disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.226" offset="1956237">It said -- the District Court said that it had no doubt that this constituted replacement of something that was no longer usable.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.217" offset="1996257">And the basis of its decision was that -- that this was a major replacement in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="500.893" offset="2106911">Do you think without disturbing the architecture of your argument is it stated the outset what legal proposition you are tending to the Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliot I. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="509.720" offset="2142229">I propose to do that Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.053" offset="2155604">In order to clarify our position in this matter and in order to be of assistance of the Court and the problems before it, I propose to divide my argument into four main sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.453" offset="2193220">First, I would like to explain exactly what the Mackie-Duluk patent is all about, what problems it was intended to solve and how it's solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.923" offset="2227075">Secondly, I will explain what the patent on err, what the both courts below considered to be an infringement of the patent and the other side of the coin what is clearly not an infringement of this patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.605" offset="2273782">Third, I will discuss the doctrine of repair versus reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.228" offset="2288306">This doctrine which we maintain has been in the law for over 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.336" offset="2304711">This doctrine which we maintain was reenacted by Congress in 1952 and this doctrine which was the very basis of both decisions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.415" offset="2341073">And finally, as a fourth section of my argument, I hope to demonstrate that what the Justice Department is here trying to do, is to change the law contrary to the intent of Congress in 1952 and that they are trying to do that on the basis of the very arguments which they presented to Congress and which were rejected by that body in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.693" offset="2422157">Is that --</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="579.876" offset="2422888">Your view -- but your view is that the Act of 1952 did not make a change in the law, but merely is declaratory of the old one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliot I. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="587.519" offset="2453400">Quite so; yes, yes and at such, as it will appear, we maintain that it has left intact as the Justice Department itself says, "Left intact, this entire body of law."</text>

            <text syncTime="599.732" offset="2502301">So you are on common ground would be of the petitioner at that point.</text>

          <turn speaker="elliot_i_pollock" startTime="602.687" stopTime="810.375">
            <label>Mr. Elliot I. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="602.687" offset="2514108">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.911" offset="2519019">Yes, we agree with the law that left intact in this question of repair versus reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.398" offset="2540962">Now let us consider this first question that I mentioned before what is the Mackie-Duluk patent all about?</text>
            <text syncTime="614.799" offset="2562591">Well, as has been clearly stated, it is not involved with the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.875" offset="2578892">It doesn't concern a car and it doesn't even concern a convertible car.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.760" offset="2594461">It concerns as its very title says, a portion of the car, a convertible folding top with an Automatic Seal at the Rear Quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.187" offset="2624136">It's concerned with one part of the car, the top structure and in that event, a special type of top structure, one, with an Automatic Seal at the Rear Quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.424" offset="2661021">Before proceeding, I think, we ought to have some definitions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.697" offset="2674186">The Rear Quarter section of the car is the section on the side of the car immediately to the rear of the side windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.317" offset="2700622">If you will picture yourself sitting in the rear seat of the car and if you look immediately to the right or the left that is the section of the car we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.561" offset="2733641">The section where this Court may recall convertible top structures in the past, used to have snap fasteners.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.907" offset="2759032">That is the very section of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.250" offset="2764361">And -- there's another term that may arise from time to time, that is the belt line of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.960" offset="2783169">That is the top of the middle structure of the car, the top of the lower body of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.426" offset="2805112">Now, prior to the Mackie-Duluk invention, fabrics which were used in inconvertible cars were typically shaped so that they terminated in his Rear Quarter section, immediately adjacent or above the belt line of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.108" offset="2855790">And they habitually had some sort of manual fasteners on them, like snap fasteners or a channel in top arrangement, so that after the top have been completely raised, this fabric in the Rear Quarter section could be pulled down and manually fastened to the belt line of the car in that region.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.134" offset="2919946">Perhaps, the Court will recall such structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.045" offset="2927574">They were the typical structure prior to 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.914" offset="2943039">Now these structures had been in existence for a long period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.424" offset="2961115">Perhaps at least, 50 years or so and over this entire period of time, everyone recognized that they had at least three major problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.492" offset="2993298">The first problem of course, was that they require, if you will, a manual seal in the Rear Quarter as distinguished on the Automatic Seal with which were concerned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.947" offset="3031124">It meant that even with the advent of motors, motor driven structures to fold your convertible top up, even after the top had been completely closed over the car, someone had to get out of the car and walk around in the side of the car and actually snap this fasteners in place to complete the closure and this often occurred under conditions of inclimate weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.924" offset="3111058">The second major problem was a problem of shrinkage in this region.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.248" offset="3128404">Since the fabric material in the Rear Quarter section was loose, we found that often after a limited period of usage, even though the top was in fine condition, the material had shrunk a little bit in this region so that even when you tried to pull the fasteners down, you just couldn't quite reach the belt line.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.881" offset="3190888">And as a result, you just couldn't make a seal at all in this region of the car and you had some loose flaps so that wind or snow or rain could come into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.844" offset="3222758">This was of course, a major problem and there was the third problem which had been discussed in the record this problem of so-called, unauthorized access.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.757" offset="3258389">A convertible car can never be reliably locked even now because the top can be slashed, but it was very easy to get into convertible cars prior to 1950, simply because anybody who wanted to get into the car, even when the doors were locked and the window's completely closed, could merely unsnap these fasteners and reach into the car at that region and open the door or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.891" offset="3338951">These three problems --</text>

            <text syncTime="830.954" offset="3427140">These three problems as they say were recognized for some 50 years and even though the engineers -- the best engineers in the industry have been working on it diligently, no solution came up until Mackie-Duluk finally came up with a solution which is the subject of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.011" offset="3491401">Mackie-Duluk solution can perhaps, be best appreciated by seeing what they didn't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.555" offset="3509582">In the first place, they made absolutely no change to the car body, no change to the folding top structure at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.404" offset="3532988">No change I should say to the bows and the pillars.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.795" offset="3546572">These were conventional linkages which were precisely the same in Mackie-Duluk's convention as they had been for years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.194" offset="3576142">What they did do, was to change the shape of the fabric in this Rear Quarter section.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.756" offset="3598399">They, rather than having the fabric terminate at the belt line of the car as was the case before, they caused the fabric to be shaped, so as to extend deep inside of the car, where it could be permanently fastened.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.907" offset="3646986">And while in retrospect, this seems to be a fairly simple approve -- improvement now, actually, it was quite a startling improvement in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.193" offset="3680110">It was an improvement which solved, if you will, 50 years of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.454" offset="3697142">And this simple change, this -- this one change in the shaping of the fabric, brought a complete solution immediately to all of these problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="2214.224" offset="8960293">In the same section of my brief, I have made reference to various pages of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.640" offset="8985893">Let us understand what this doctrine of repair versus reconstruction is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.373" offset="9008880">Many years ago, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a poem which the Court of Appeals referred to and I -- and I refer to that poem with no intent (Inaudible) because it -- it thoroughly illustrates the problem that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.359" offset="9056841">In that poem, The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay, Dr. Holmes discussed the deacon's building of a shay which had no weakest part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.780" offset="9098533">And he pointed out that after a hundred years of use these shays went to pieces all at once, all at once and nothing first, just as bubbles do when they burst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.389" offset="9132910">That's a quotation from the poem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.036" offset="9143568">Well in our common knowledge, in our common everyday experience, things just don't happen this way, neither a shays nor anything else we can conceive of, other than a bubble goes to pieces all at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.534" offset="9193514">In any arrangement of structure, in any structure which has more than one part, there's always some weakest part and there's going to be some part that is gone in advance of other parts for one reason or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.747" offset="9242311">Now the doctrine of repair versus reconstruction built on this common everyday realization that after a period of time, no matter what combination of structure might be sold, patented or otherwise, no matter what combination of structure maybe sold after a period of time, some parts of it are going to be gone for one reason or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.061" offset="9319633">And it may occur that the parts which are gone are so important to the true inventive concept, are in their nature, the heart of the invention or the vital component that the entire invention can be said to be destroyed even though some parts of the structure remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.561" offset="9401657">Let me give you some typical decided cases on this point here, I am going through them briefly because I think that it will illustrate the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.243" offset="9432377">One of the classic cases in this field, a case which has been cited time and again in many decisions is the First Circuit case of Davis Electrical Works versus the Edison Electric Light Company, which was decided in the First Circuit in 1894.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.034" offset="9491519">In that particular case, Mr. Thomas Edison, who's well known to all of us, invented a new filament for a light bulb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.183" offset="9520149">Now, a new filament is meaningless in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.692" offset="9530180">It has no functional utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.343" offset="9536763">It just can't -- can't even be described, if you will, in accordance with the rules of the Patent Office all by itself, but this new filament was of a use in conjunction with a glass -- glass envelop which surrounded it and with a socket for screwing it into a plug of sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.953" offset="9607189">And therefore, in his claims, Mr. Edison got a combination claim, if you will, which included not only the new filament, but these standard background elements which were necessary to its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.866" offset="9658807">He claimed in his claims, the glass envelope and the socket and certain electrical connectors, but there was no question in that case nor is there any in this case, that the true inventive concept was only in one part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.646" offset="9710007">Now after a period of time, Mr. Edison's bulb burned out, such things do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.478" offset="9725262">Well, the only thing that went bad was the filament, the new part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.371" offset="9740831">The rest of the envelope and the sockets and everything were perfectly good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.237" offset="9756296">And in these circumstances we found that the defendant would gather up these bulbs and he would replace the attenuated carbon filament with a brand new filament of precisely the type that Edison had developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.550" offset="9809586">He did, if you will, replace only one component of the patented combination albeit in that case the heart of an invention, the true inventive concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.913" offset="9846993">And in that case, the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit, noting that the true test was entirely factual; noting that it was a question of ultimate fact to be decided by juries and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.335" offset="9892760">In that case, the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit held that even though only one part of the combination was replaced, nevertheless, this was a reconstruction of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.861" offset="9934764">For it was a re-providing of the heart and essence of the invention.</text>
