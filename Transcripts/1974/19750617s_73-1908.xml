            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.934" offset="31660">This case is also here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.003" offset="59977">Petitioner Cort, who is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bethlehem Steel Corporation, he and his follow directors authorized the use of corporate moneys during the 1972 Presidential campaign to pay for political advertisements in various newspapers and magazines purporting to refute statements of the Democratic candidate, George McGovern, that corporations did not carry their fair share of the tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.505" offset="189962">Respondent, Ash, is a Bethlehem stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.414" offset="205636">He filed this suit before election day in 1972, charging that the use of corporate moneys to pay for the advertisements violated the criminal statute Section 610, prohibiting corporations from making expenditures in connection with any Presidential election.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.563" offset="290168">And he sought, both as citizen and stockholder, injunctive relief against those expenditures in connection, not alone with the 1972 Presidential election but also in connection with any future Presidential campaigns, and he also sought compensatory and punitive damages in favor of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.306" offset="393195">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that this private cause of action whether brought by respondent, Ash, as a citizen to secure injunctive relief or as a stockholder to secure injunctive or derivative damage relief is a proper remedy to address the violation of the criminal statute, Section 610, prohibiting corporate expenditures in presidential election campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.300" offset="509179">Well, we reverse on both aspects of the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.385" offset="533525">As to the injunctive relief which at this state of course concerns only future elections, we hold that the judgment must be reversed in light of the creations since the Court of Appeals decision by the Congress of the Federal Election Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.643" offset="598518">The Amendments creating that Commission expressly require that complaints of irregularities in the future campaigns must be filed with the Commission and empowers the Commission to decide whether to request the Attorney General to file a civil action for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.910" offset="671556">Since our duty is to decide this case according to the law existing at the time of our decision, respondent then must file with the Commission any complaints he may make of irregularities in connection with future campaigns and cannot maintain this action at this juncture for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.354" offset="753371">We also reverse the judgment insofar as respondent seeks damages derivatively as stockholder, although the fact that violation of a criminal statute is charged does not necessarily preclude implication of a private cause of action for damages, we can find no indication whatever in the legislative history of the 1970 Amendments that suggest a congressional intention to vest in corporate shareholders a private federal right to sue for damages for its violation if they have such a right they must seek it under state law.</text>
