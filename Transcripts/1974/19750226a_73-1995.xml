            <text syncTime="378.877" offset="1618840">It simply means that that evidence would be only relevant to the question of whether the minor should be retained in the juvenile system, or transferred to the adult system.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.716" offset="1758229">Now, just yesterday in opinion issued by this Court, United States against Jenkins, this Court in a unanimous opinion rejected the broad type of continuing jeopardy theory which has been espoused by petitioner and stated that that theory which was originated in a dissenting opinion by Justice Holmes in the Kepner case, has never been adopted by a majority of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.928" offset="3263091">But turning to some of these policy reasons concerning the juvenile court, which you brought up Mr. Justice Brennan, it's our position that if you apply the double jeopardy protection in this context, you will actually be enhancing the fundamental fairness of the juvenile court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.180" offset="3336129">Whereas in McKeiver, this Court felt that that system would be threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.641" offset="3353893">For one thing, this Court has frequently emphasized the absolute necessity of a juvenile court system operating in an informal manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.946" offset="3391195">And by an informal manner, I think that what was meant was that in most juvenile cases, the juvenile if he's indeed guilty will come in and admit his transgression.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.066" offset="3431633">There will not be even the necessity of a formal adversary hearing with counsel and all the other trappings.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.635" offset="3453889">And then the Court will get on with its primary business, which it is to rehabilitate the juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.516" offset="3477400">Now, that policy goal of informality is really largely frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.019" offset="3499447">If the juvenile contests the petition and decides to stand trial, in that case, he will be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.857" offset="3530794">It will be a formal adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.342" offset="3540720">Now, I would point out that if you hold the jurisdictional hearing first, the minor does not, at that point, know whether he's going to be retained in the juvenile system or ultimately transferred to the adult court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.588" offset="3589726">So he will, as a consequence, be extremely reluctant to admit his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.223" offset="3608221">As a result of that admission, he may later find himself in state prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.558" offset="3625566">Indeed the volume on juvenile court practice, which has been published by the California State Bar to advice juvenile court practitioners on how to handle these kinds of cases, advises counsel not to encourage the minor to talk freely with the probation officer until he knows whether the juvenile will be retained in the juvenile system or transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.877" offset="3718875">So that policy goal will be totally frustrated if you don't hold the fitness hearing first.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.386" offset="3740923">Secondly, the juvenile will be kept in a continuing state of anxiety, insecurity, unless you hold certification hearing or a transfer hearing initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.958" offset="3787212">We believe that from the rehabilitative point of view it's extremely vital that the juvenile know whether he's going to be treated as a juvenile or as an adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.908" offset="3830993">Certainly, this Court has found that the appearance as well as the actuality of fairness is crucial in terms of the rehabilitation of a juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.968" offset="3871222">And from a standpoint of a minor, he can't very well feel that he is being dealt with fairly if he is being exposed to a double prosecution, which he knows has been held to be repugnant in the case of even the most hardened criminals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.224" offset="4588231">For one thing, he realizes that he will have an opportunity to put on that defense later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.764" offset="4610382">And he doesn't want to tip his hand, so to speak, to reveal his entire defense to the prosecution at that early stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.014" offset="4763460">I think there's still the question of the juvenile's particular amenability to treatment programs available through the juvenile court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.409" offset="4800972">I think that in most instances, the judge would allow in some evidence pertaining to the crime such as he may want to consider whether the crime was of a particularly heinous character, or whether it's a very serious type of offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.270" offset="4868472">But in most instances, the judge will say “If the juvenile is charged with murder, he's charged with a robbery or rape,” that's a serious crime and that's enough from the standpoint of the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.480" offset="4909328">I point out in California, if the legislature has not written a probable cause requirement into the fitness statute, which they could've done, which has been done in some states.</text>
