            <label>Mr. Patrick Hardin</label>
            <text syncTime="34.080" offset="239679">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.331" offset="256711">This case like the one just argued presents the Court with the issue whether it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse an employee's request for the presence of her union representative at an investigatory interview which the employee reasonably believes will lead to disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.024" offset="335496">And I'd like to begin by pointing out to that there are no cross-petitions in this case, and that to the propriety of the fifth -- of the labor and the Fifth Circuit determination that the right to union representation, as a part of the right to bargain collectively arises at the point where discipline is to be imposed is an issue not directly presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.276" offset="436433">We are here concerned with a different part of the statutory rights conferred by Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.798" offset="466526">Specifically, they are the rights to act in concert from mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.558" offset="493589">The Board is held that that grant of statutory right, which is to be distinguished from the right to act in concert for the purpose of collective bargaining, does grant to the employee the right to be represented at an investigatory interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.243" offset="556387">I'm going to state the facts --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="128.148" offset="615946">The statute says to engage in other concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.620" offset="629844">Now, that's a little different arguably.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.398" offset="640920">In other words, if you're going to rely on the statutory language, I think it's quite important that we keep our eye on what the statutory --</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick Hardin</label>
            <text syncTime="141.873" offset="670908">You're quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.445" offset="673102">It must be concerted activity, and the Labor Board of course has found that one employee stretches a hand to the other to seek that mutual aid, they are engaged in concerted activity or are seeking to do so a right which the Board can protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.562" offset="733602">I think that a statement of the facts will help to illustrate for the Court very clearly the value to the employee of the right which the Board has recognized in this case as it did in Quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.284" offset="796505">J. Weingarten Company operates a chain of about 100 retail stores in the Houston, Texas area.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.410" offset="821060">Like most large retail and distribution enterprises, it maintains a centralized security apparatus, one of the purposes of which is to investigate suspected employee theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.403" offset="876962">Leura Collins is an employee of J. Weingarten and has been employed since 1961 in a number of stores working at lunch counters or in the lobby departments, a more sophisticated prepared food takeout arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.608" offset="945821">In June of 1972, Mrs. Collins was working at store number 98, and in June of 1972, information came to the company's attention which suggested that Mrs. Collins was engaged in dishonest activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.006" offset="1007365">The record does not disclose either the source of the nature of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.311" offset="1028577">The company reacted to it by dispatching one of its Loss Prevention Specialists, Mr. Hardy to conduct an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.786" offset="1058565">And on June 15, 1972, Mr. Hardy began two days of plain close surveillance of the operation of the lobby department at Store No. 98.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.807" offset="1106631">He saw nothing which indicated any evidence of wrongdoing by the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.198" offset="1124185">And on the third morning, which would have been the 18th, he introduced himself to the store manager at Store No. 98, Mr. York.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.397" offset="1156995">The two have not previously known one another, and the Loss Prevention Specialists identified himself as a member of the central security bureau of the employer's operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.248" offset="1200358">He reported that he had conducted an investigation into the lobby department, and had found no evidence of any employee dishonesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.026" offset="1231496">The manager responded by saying “why just this very morning, another employee in the lobby department reported to me that yesterday, Mrs. Collins took a $3.00 box of fried chicken from the lobby department, and put only a dollar in the till.”</text>
            <text syncTime="297.151" offset="1291995">Well, the Loss Prevention Specialists decided to check that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.467" offset="1309236">He summoned the employee who had so reported to the manager, Mrs. Moody, and he interrogated her about the allegation of -- that Mrs. Collins had stolen $2.00 worth of chicken the day before.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.132" offset="1359914">Mrs. Moody confirmed the story, and then, Mrs. Collins was summoned to an area near the manager's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.774" offset="1386454">There, she was confronted with the Loss Prevention Specialists from headquarters, who began to interrogate her about the general acts of dishonesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.520" offset="1421458">Mrs. Collins asked if she could have the assistance or the presence of her union representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.373" offset="1440893">The store manager said “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.725" offset="1446222">This is a private matter between you and the company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="339.846" offset="1462732">With respect to the questioning about the box of chicken on the preceding day, Mrs. Collins stated “We had been out of small boxes, so I took a small $1.00 quantity of chicken, put it in a larger box, paid the dollar for it and left the store.”</text>
            <text syncTime="355.247" offset="1524381">The Loss Prevention Specialists went to check this out and he determined that in fact, the store had been out of smaller boxes on the preceding day, and that the employee who had reported on Mrs. Collins didn't know how much chicken she'd put in the large box.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.793" offset="1582582">He went back to the interview and said “The interview is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.022" offset="1595434">Your story checks out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="375.033" offset="1603480">At that point, Mrs. Collins became very emotional and began to cry, probably tears of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.878" offset="1630856">But in any rate in her relief, she says “I've worked for Weingarten's for 11 years and I've never taken anything that I've paid for, except the free lunches.”</text>
            <text syncTime="393.596" offset="1677772">The Loss Prevention Specialists and the manager professed to be astonished that anyone was getting free lunches at Weingarten's, and they immediately resumed the interrogation. [Crowd laughing]</text>

            <text syncTime="413.009" offset="1755408">The -- Mrs. Collins again asked for the assistance of her union representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.339" offset="1776724">She insisted that she had taken lunches because it was the practice of all the employees, including the lobby department manager to do so, and she indicated that she would not sign a statement which the Loss Prevention Specialists was then typing by which she was to acknowledge a debt to the company of $160.00 for lunches which she shouldn't have eaten.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.155" offset="1863973">The Loss Prevention Specialists then made some further inquiries and discovered that no one at company headquarters could say for sure that there was or was not a policy permitting free lunches at Store 98.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.097" offset="2495718">The Board adopted the decision of its administrative law judge, which applied the then recent Quality Manufacturing decision and found that there had been concerted activity for the purpose of mutual aid and protection, and then addressed the question whether Mrs. Collins' fears that the interview might lead to discipline were reasonably based in all the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.031" offset="2607522">The decision takes particular note of the fact that these events occurred in the retail industry, and that Weingarten in common most members of that industry, most important is in that industry, regard employee dishonesty were proved to the employer's satisfaction to be an unpardonable offense the discipline for which ordinarily is discharged, unless there are exceptional litigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.304" offset="2708564">With that in mind and because the contract here provided that the usual system of warning notices was not available to an employee who was deemed guilty of theft to the employer's satisfaction, the law judge concluded that Mrs. Collins' manifest fears had indeed been reasonably grounded and objective circumstances, and that she was entitled either to have the assistance of her union representative at that interview, or to have the company terminate the interview and forgo the benefit of what information it might get from interrogating her.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.955" offset="2847222">The Fifth Circuit refused to enforce the order of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.473" offset="2869269">It noted first in apparent conflict or inconsistency between the result in this case and the result which that court had disapproved in the earlier Texaco decision noted the apparent inconsistency between the result here and its own earlier Texaco decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.089" offset="2947741">But then, coming directly to grips with the Board's rational in this case, that is the proposition that the language of Section 7 itself confers the right, the court rejected that rational apparently and the opinion is not entirely clear, but apparently, not because it regarded its own earlier decisions as controlling, but because it disagreed with the Board about the need to extend that kind of protection to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.018" offset="3067486">The court says and this is from page 7 (a) of our petition for certiorari in this case, the court says while a basic purpose of Section 7 is to allow employees to engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid and protection, such a need does not arise at an investigatory interview to extend to the scope of the act's protection to such preliminary contacts between an employee and his employer would be to apply an overbroad interpretation of Section 7, without explanation as to why or direct explanation as to why it regarded the protections as unneeded and the construction of the statute which the Board had settled on as being overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.980" offset="3259329">Now, the decision of the Fifth Circuit is defended in this Court, basically upon two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.583" offset="3289736">The first, there is the argument that the right conferred cannot be logically found within the confines of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.715" offset="3330278">And secondly, its argued that the Board's decision is basically unwise or that the cost of securing these employee rights will be so far outweighed by the -- the advantages of securing these employee rights will be so far outweighed by the costs to the employers but it's unwise to grant them in the first instance of varying on that last argument is that the Board hasn't really clearly told us it made that balance, and so you can affirm it even if it's the right balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.293" offset="5752560">And at that time, I think it is very pertinent to note, this issue had received only the least adumbration, only one decision from the Board had dealt in this area so far as our research discloses, and that was the case where the Board expressly pretermitted dealing with the question whether an employee has an individual right to representation, and of course was the Ross Gear &amp; Tool decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.340" offset="5872724">Well, the Seventh Circuit somewhat put the development of the law of the track by viewing the cases raising the issue which the Board had pretermitted, but then instead of remanding the case so that the Board could answer that question, the Seventh Circuit decided it and probably wrongly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.477" offset="6041266">So that we only return to this arena with the issuance of the Board's decision in Quality Manufacturing -- in Texaco, and that point, the Fifth Circuit because persuaded by the Board's view that at least at the point were discipline is to be imposed by the employer, the employee has the right under the collective bargaining part of Section 7 to have the union representative present, and the union representative has the right to be there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.264" offset="6664443">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.405" offset="6676982">In exploring upon what basis of the Labor Board now construes at Section 7 that creates an affirmative right for an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.559" offset="6717628">I believe it's interesting to look at what the Board does not cite as authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.447" offset="6737168">First of all, there is no citation or articulation of the legislative history as been stated before, the concentration the legislative history, both for the Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Amendment was directed at the inequality of employees before their employers on the basis of economic pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.455" offset="6821177">It is this thrust as Senator Wagner states say in the legislative history that was sought to be counterbalanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.538" offset="6853569">They were sought to be an adjustment of an employees and employer's right to deal economically one with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.978" offset="6883244">Admittedly, Section 7 does not protect all concerted rights or all concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.956" offset="6907173">No one would state that illegal concerted activities are protected by a Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.031" offset="6931519">Not every employer contact with an employee was sought to be protected by Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.811" offset="6954611">We submit that based upon the overall view of the legislative history, it is the economic pressure that an employee was unable to exert against his employer on an individual basis that is considered, and is this economic pressure that should be allowed to flow between parties under the statute of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.501" offset="7049383">As NLRA have stated, there is no collective bargaining in a pre-decisional fact-finding investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.603" offset="7081775">There is no decision here that an employer who deals with employee merely to elicit facts is circumventing the provisions of Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.066" offset="7131617">In fact, the legislative intent does not manifest an employee may control the employer's avenue of gaining information concerning his operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.396" offset="7184906">The idea of mutual aid or protection has been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.383" offset="7200893">What is a dichotomy and perhaps an anomaly is the fact that the Board is taking the position that these collective interest do not rise to a level sufficient to permit the union to be present, but do rise to a level who will permit the employee to institute representational assistance if he so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.491" offset="7285321">It's difficult for us to understand why if the union requests the representation, it is not permitted, and while the employee requested it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.622" offset="7321893">It seems to us that the same rights would be involved regardless of the party requesting representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.726" offset="7354284">The Labor Board has imputed or implied that an employee when he re-seeks the aid of his representative or another employee is engaged in protected concerted activity, this implies that employee is not seeking self protection or protection against questions which may be embarrassing or particularly proving that that he is seeking to in the future make a situation where other employees will be accorded similar treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.268" offset="7484479">Now, this is a factor which has not been explored by the record, but it is imputed to an employee by the Labor Board that when he does request that a union representative be present, it is for concerted activity, when in fact it may be for self-preservation as oppose to any effort or motivation on a concerted basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.790" offset="7582490">It's been stated that the contracts in many major companies provide for representation of an employee in an investigatory interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.026" offset="7635466">The fact that this is in industrial situations today, we believe to be evidence of the fact that the right to bargain collectively for the right of representation of employee at an investigatory interview has not been diluted by the prior position of the Board that no right existed in the context of a fact-finding investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.480" offset="7725328">In fact, the Board has not taken the position today that any of its prior decisions had been reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.703" offset="7754167">In a prior case of date and typographic where the employer is sought the question employees about errors that they made in proofreading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.559" offset="7785618">The Trial Examiner of the Labor Board found that there was no concerted activity and the Board adopted that position, yet the Board has not attempted to reverse that decision or other decisions which have created this dichotomy between investigatory and disciplinary reviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.515" offset="7857403">The idea that an employee is statutorily protected from interviews by his employee, presupposes that there is an adversary condition, that there is a situation where an employee is immediately placed under suspicion or under fear of adverse consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.898" offset="7934934">And to permit an employee's speculation as to what an employer may do with information that he gathers is to take the employer his unfair labor practice completely out of his intent or purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.233" offset="7984253">For an employee, may wrongly suppose that an employee's questions and employer's questions may result in disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.432" offset="8021138">The case that's before this Court involved a suspicion theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.943" offset="8039111">The case that involved the Labor Board decision of Texaco Los Angeles Terminal involved the situation where an employee refused to drive a piece of equipment which he deemed to be defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.226" offset="8088325">In that case, the Trial Examiner found that there was no violation of the Act because the employee on one point had no reason to believe that his job status was in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.244" offset="8136391">It is difficult for us representing employers to determine which belief of the Labor Board is to be followed, where they adopt decisions by administrative larger as use on a Trial Examiners that questions concerning insubordination do not raised the level of reasonable fear, whereas they say that questions concerning thefts do raise that fear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.344" offset="10120756">I mean it seems to me what you're saying is under the rule, you contend for under the statute, no finding could ever be made in favor of the employee, under the Board's rule occasionally it will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.720" offset="10162239">Now, if I were an employee, I'd rather have a rule that would occasionally benefit me than one that would never benefit me.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neil Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="2520.859" offset="10186794">Under the rule as you stated now Your Honor, the rule says where it may possibly result in the decision adversely affecting his employment status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.984" offset="10231306">That permits a broad possibility of may use and under that circumstance, it would be very difficult for an employee not to be entitled to protection because he could fear that it may possibly result in disciplinary action under even the most innocuous circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.645" offset="10325974">What we are saying is that in an investigatory interview, there is no coercive atmosphere automatically and imputed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.868" offset="10362859">The Board is further confused the issue by its decision in Western Electric Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.806" offset="10386578">There, the two members, Panelo and Kennedy who have voted that there was no statutory right or joined by Chairman Miller who found that where the employee had previously arbitrated the issue of whether or not an employee is entitled to representations at an investigatory interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.491" offset="10469334">That since, it had been previously decided adversely to the union in the prior arbitration cases that this was sufficient to permit the employer to deny the representation in this case, and he found that it was consistent with the statutory scheme to permit such a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.210" offset="10552195">So, where we have a situation where there is no basis upon which an employer's either purpose or intention or knowledge controls his own unfair labor practices, then we have a situation where speculation or subjective state of mind of the employee controls an employer's unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.650" offset="10653968">And the role of the union representative is largely unrefined as it is now stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.424" offset="10681031">Before the court at Mobil, the Board took the position that the representative of the Union was merely there present as an advisor, as a conciliator perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.685" offset="10730141">If you follow the logic of the Board's position and of the statute where the union is the exclusive bargaining representative of its employees, then perhaps the union would be in the position to preclude the employer from directing any questions to the employee directly, but would have to go through the union as the exclusive representative of the employee to direct any questions concerning the employee's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.054" offset="10847587">We would summarize by saying that investigatory interview is a premature stage at which the right of representation exists because the purpose is to merely elicit in a true fact-finding investigation the facts of the matter and not to pre-decide or to pre-seal a decision of an employer or the faith of an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.222" offset="10944240">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.755" offset="10982379">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.314" offset="10992619">I would conclude by pointing out to the Court that the statutory language “concerted activity” is more than just language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.904" offset="11026996">It defines rather broad concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.586" offset="11037759">This Court in the Jones &amp; Laughlin case upholding the constitutionality of the statute acknowledged that it granted fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.934" offset="11075062">And the Board's decision as to what that statutory language means and what content it should be given in the real industrial world, is entitled to great weight and should be accepted if the interpretation is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.183" offset="11148100">And it's reasonable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.043" offset="11155519">The Board has fashioned a rule which does not grant and absolute right, the right to the assistance arises only if there is a reasonable objective basis for the fear that discipline is to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.595" offset="11205778">And even in that event, the employer is given the option of forgoing the interview altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.674" offset="11230020">The Board has balanced the conflicting interests and has settled on a resolution which is well within the perimeters of the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.489" offset="11269308">Here to return to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question again, the problem here for the reviewing court is much the same as it is in the Linden and Wilder case this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.662" offset="11314030">The Congress has left it to the Board to define the reach of the broad statutory language in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.146" offset="11339943">We submit that in both these cases, the Board has reached a reasonable result, and that defines the limits of judicial review in both cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.970" offset="11519248">But that of course neglects the question whether Section 7 extends rights in this arena, not only to employees who are represented by union, but also to employees who are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.671" offset="11566059">And the statutory statement of the language in the disjunctive suggests Congress intended to grant some rights beyond the right to engage in collective bargaining through a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.170" offset="11612035">And the Board has given content to those words here by finding that the right exists where the employee reasonably perceives that he or she needs help and seeks it.</text>
