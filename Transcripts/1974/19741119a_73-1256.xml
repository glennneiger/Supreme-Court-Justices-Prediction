            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Canterbury, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="39.858" offset="262771">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.220" offset="276250">Your Honors, this case involves the Antitrust issues involved in an agreement between a Plumbers Union and a general contractor in Dallas, Texas, whereby the general contractor has been coerced into an agreement that he will refuse to do business with and will boycott all subcontractors for mechanical work unless so subcontractors in turn have a collective Bargaining Agreement with the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.624" offset="401847">Your Honors, this case involves no manner an employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.430" offset="433089">The petitioner in the case, Connell Construction Company, does not have or never has had a single employee represented by the respondent Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.385" offset="476871">The District Court below did not decide the Antitrust issues in the agreement but held that the proviso to Section 8 (e) of the Taft-Hartley Act protected the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.527" offset="533504">The Fifth Circuit in turn found that the Union's actions were Antitrust exempt, but failed to decide any of the labor questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.220" offset="584286">The Union filed for a declaratory judgment that the agreement was protected by the construction industry proviso to Section 8 (e) of The Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.770" offset="626500">I would point out Your Honors that the Fifth Circuit in very strong words admonished the National Labor Relations Act to decide the Labor issues involved in the case at the next available opportunity which has not been done even though the board in this case has filed an amicus brief where they admit that the issue of the Construction Industry proviso to Section 8 (e) of the Taft-Hartley Act has never been decided by the board, outside of an employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.156" offset="771950">The facts quickly are that Connell Construction Company is a general contractor and the construction done is in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.812" offset="810611">Connell obtains its work by competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.478" offset="829315">Connell in turn sub contracts mechanical work by competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.822" offset="850631">Connell is involved in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.180" offset="868080">The mechanical portion of any construction project, an equal to 40-50% of the project indeed on power plants, generating plants it can equal more than that, mechanical construction normally includes all of the piping, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and plumbing, in fact in some of our very sophisticated air-conditioning system, that even includes computers, includes a major portion of any construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.358" offset="1004753">The Union respondent in the December of 1970, sent a letter to Connell saying, “We want you to enter into an agreement with us that you will refuse to do business,” I am paraphrasing the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.582" offset="1069746">“You will not do business with any mechanical subcontractor unless they have an agreement with us, a Collective Bargain Agreement.”</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_f_canterbury_jr" startTime="260.490" stopTime="406.158">
            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Canterbury, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="260.490" offset="1145292">No Your Honor, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.475" offset="1149262">Mr. Chief Justice, the record shows that over the past 23 years, Connell has on a recurring basis, done business with both Union and open-shop mechanical contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.304" offset="1200567">In fact at the time that the Union sent the letter and the agreement and subsequently started picketing for the agreement, Connell indeed had a Union contractor who had a Collective Bargain Agreement with the Union on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.067" offset="1263679">The record clearly shows that Connell up until this time did not care what the labor policy of the subcontractors were.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.218" offset="1292204">He admittedly is in a competitive business, and he looks for competitive bids from qualified contractors and when the after Connell failed to sign the agreement the Union commenced picketing about one of Connell's projects where there was a Union Subcontractor, about a 150 man ordered to picket line brought construction to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.669" offset="1382066">Connell filed an action in the State Court in Texas alleging that the agreement was violative of the Antitrust laws, at the State of Texas, a restraining order was issued, the case was removed to Federal Court at which time Connell amended its pleadings and alleged not only it violated the Antitrust Laws of Texas, but also the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.844" offset="1470777">Your Honors, as to whether or not the Union has been a party and has been caused a violation of Sherman Act will turn upon the extent of the Union's immunity from the Labor Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.753" offset="1550399">I think if we can look at the agreement on its face, the agreement on its face is simply an agreement between two parties, a Union and a non-labor party Connell, whereby agreement is reached that, Connell will not do business with other people not just one subcontractor, but every mechanical contractor from Dallas to the Oklahoma border who does not have a Collective Bargain Agreement with the Union for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.957" offset="1679235">The Union did not seek to protect wages, working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.806" offset="1702640">The evidence shows nothing as to what open-shop or non-union subcontractors paid their employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.158" offset="1728031">But Mr. Canterbury I gather, it's not just a contract between an employer and the Union, it's a contract between an employer and the Union and the construction industry.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Canterbury, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="421.320" offset="1788635">Your Honor, you are referring to the proviso to Section 8 (e) of the Labor Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="425.212" stopTime="426.795">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="425.212" offset="1804204">I think you have to deal with that concern?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_f_canterbury_jr" startTime="426.795" stopTime="1308.367">
            <label>Mr. Joseph F. Canterbury, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="426.795" offset="1810578">Yes, I would deal with that Your Honor, I certainly will.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.686" offset="1826147">But on the face of the agreement on it's face, it's clearly a restrain of trade, clearly violates the Sherman Act unless the Union is exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.032" offset="1875466">Now, let's look as to whether or not the Union's actions are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.559" offset="1901589">I am well aware and we all are of course of the the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the Clayton Act and the exemptions which they grant to Unions for certain activities, not all from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.789" offset="1954565">The first theory is the Conspiracy theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.805" offset="1966582">It's been held from Allan Bradley and numerous cases since then, that if a Union conspires with a non-labor group or source to restrain trade, then there is like anyone else, it's just like two businessmen, if they enter into an agreement to restrain trade, if the Union enters into a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.916" offset="2055084">Your Honor, the conspiracy in this case is two-fold and I must step back into the facts at one important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.589" offset="2081729">Prior to the time that the Union came to the Connell, they entered into a Multi Employer Agreement with the largest Union as mechanical contractors in the Dallas area.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.616" offset="2129795">That agreement contained a Favorite Nation's Clause which prohibited the Union from giving any employer, any better terms or conditions than was contained in the Multi Employer group in that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.089" offset="2195728">The business agent at the trial of the case testified, I asked him, “Suppose Connell wanted to do business with a subcontractor, a mechanical contractor who is not a party to your Collective Bargain Agreement, could that mechanical contract coming and negotiate one?</text>
            <text syncTime="540.296" offset="2264586">Business agent says, no you can only sign our established agreement, that's the only agreement someone can sign.”</text>
            <text syncTime="548.309" offset="2296560">Now the Union, since this case was argued at the Fifth Circuit, the Union has dropped its Favorite Nation's Clause from its Master Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.158" offset="2335953">I submit that the facts are still the same that the Union only has one form of Collective Bargain Agreement, that's the Master Area Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.555" offset="2373569">Now who were the benefactors of this conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="571.311" offset="2388616">Connell is a conspirator.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.644" offset="2397915">He is an unwilling conspirator clearly unwilling, but the benefactors of the mechanical contractors who are a party to the Union's Collective Bargain Agreement, the Master Area Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.076" offset="2455698">If Connell is restricted, and Connell is just one contractor of meeting in the area, if general contractors are restricted from subcontracting out work to open-shop mechanicals, of course, the Union Mechanicals are the benefactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.911" offset="2519019">I believe that indeed a conspiracy by the Union first making this agreement with the Unionized contractors and then come into Connell and insisting that Connell place all those with whom he does business under the same agreement, but that is a conspiracy, Connell is a link.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.593" offset="2597700">Connell and other general contractors or the method in which it's transmitted but even beyond that Connell, even though he doesn't get a bit of benefit and although he is an unwilling conspirator, he is a non-labor party and the agreement clearly restrains trade outside of any employer-employer relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.985" offset="2683277">I believe that even if there is no conspiracy, we must look to see whether or not that the Union and whether or not this agreement fosters a legitimate Union interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.460" offset="2733223">This Court's decision in Jewel Tea clearly held that even if there is no conspiracy and if a labor-management agreement involves restrains of trade inquiry does not start with conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.310" offset="2796648">You look at the agreement, you look at the effects and you compare it with National Labor Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.102" offset="2823816">Indeed Your Honors from as far back as the Danbury Hatters case, Hutcheson, Apex, Allen Bradley, every labor anti trust case which has come before this Court, the agreement that is found in restrain of trade has been compared against National Labor Policy and I think that's what must be done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.719" offset="2930291">The agreement must be compared against the National Labor Policy which is primarily found in the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.654" offset="2961951">Even harder and one that I accept is the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.314" offset="2980655">I believe comparing the agreement with the Norris-LaGuardia Act itself shows that this type of an agreement is not legitimate labor activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.772" offset="3018480">The Norris-LaGuardia Act talks in terms of fostering collective bargaining, fostering the rights of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.427" offset="3053066">The Taft-Hartley Act in 47, the entire preamble of the Act is to foster collective bargaining and for employees to be free to choose their own representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.170" offset="3108028">The Act does not favor unionism, nor non unionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.853" offset="3130807">It doesn't favor unions or employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.789" offset="3142510">The Act favors the rights of the employees to select.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.933" offset="3163094">Let's look at what this agreement and what the effects of it do to first Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.844" offset="3190784">Union has no dispute with Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.540" offset="3201546">The letter they sent to Connell seeking this agreement said, we don't want to represent a single one of your employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.958" offset="3227251">They have no dispute whatsoever with Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.797" offset="3238536">Their dispute, alleged dispute is with open-shop mechanical contractors which Connell didn't have at the time of this whole -- all of this picketing started.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.049" offset="3291617">When they went to picket the project, Connell being a neutral employer, that was a clear cut secondary boycott, clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.763" offset="3334457">Further, he is being enmeshed in a dispute that is not his, and that's what the whole purpose, one of the main purposes of our labor act has been is to protect neutral employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.182" offset="3384090">Let's look at the Section 7 rights of the employees of the mechanical construction firms with whom Connell must boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.061" offset="3419617">Where their rights lie?</text>
            <text syncTime="831.287" offset="3428498">Section 7 of the Taft-Hartley Act says that the right to choose our own representatives to bargain collectively the representatives of their own choosing to engage in protected activities are to refrain from union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.028" offset="3491506">Let's look at these employees, what rights do they have?</text>
            <text syncTime="850.786" offset="3506552">They have none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.900" offset="3515016">As this type of an agreement that is involved in this case becomes broader and broader, they have no choice, their employer must sign up with the respondent union or go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.635" offset="3561932">It doesn't make any difference if they voted for another union, if they voted against a union or if they just don't want to belong a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.965" offset="3591189">They don't have a thing to say about it because the local union controls the construction market.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.486" offset="3625357">Either you sign up with them or you don't get work because if the general contractors who award the work are unable to subcontract, then they get no work.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.906" offset="3671019">Those rights are obliterated.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.076" offset="3679692">Section 9 of the Act gives the employers a right to an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.020" offset="3695470">They have no rights to an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.907" offset="3706964">I submit and it's set forth in our briefs Your Honor that if you compare this agreement to the Labor Act, you will find that indeed it is violative of numerous provisions of the Act and against just main purposes to foster collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.261" offset="3780420">Let's look at that and go back, is this a legitimate union interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="924.718" offset="3802258">Is it a legitimate union interest outside of the employer-employee relationship to force a boycott of the proportions which has been involved in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="934.385" offset="3840920">I submit that it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.173" offset="3848025">There is no way, this agreement when compared with the Taft-Hartley Act can measure up to be legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.007" offset="3887417">Now it is always anything that a union does for its members or that benefits its members, I am sure they were categorized as a legitimate union interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.858" offset="3930781">I submit, let's look at how they achieve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.454" offset="3945200">The Taft-Hartley Act gives them ample ways to organize subcontractors, mechanical contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.968" offset="3971218">They can go out and try to organize, they can hold an election, let the employees decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.544" offset="3997550">But as this type of activity which goes right to the source of the work, the general contractor, and says, you refused to do business with anybody who doesn't have an agreement with us then it has become a clear cut restrain of trade beyond any -- no way I think we could find any legitimate union interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.258" offset="4096397">Your Honors, the agreement also -- it's not limited any particular project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.552" offset="4125550">It's limit -- it has no limitation whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.320" offset="4140701">It's forever future on any construction project in which the general contractors involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.287" offset="4168495">I would like to direct your attention to the union's sole defense to this case and that is Section 8 (e) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.594" offset="4205798">The Union has taken the position that Section 8 (e) which was enacted in 1959 to outlaw hot cargo agreements, protects this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.425" offset="4249057">Your Honors when the Act was amended in 1959, it came about because really of two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.867" offset="4282807">I think that we must trace very quickly the history and what brought about 8 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.250" offset="4312377">We first go to two cases, Denver Building Trades, this Court decided in 1954 which clearly distinguished between the general contractor and the subcontractor as separate employers at the construction project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.517" offset="4373400">This type of agreement obliterates that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.403" offset="4388968">If the union can radiate these disputes from with a particular subcontractor and say, no, we have got a dispute with the contractor, we have got a primary dispute; all it takes is change in the wording on their picket signs and Denver Building Trades is gone, that's what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.401" offset="4460962">Okay, then we must go to the Sand Door case decided by this Court in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.747" offset="4486353">In Sand Door, it was held that a hot cargo clause with no defense to a secondary boycott, but the Court stated that if an employer and a union voluntarily agreed to a boycott, that is not a violation of the secondary boycott (Inaudible) If it's free of course, if it's voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.644" offset="4573915">That decision is what led to the enactment of 8 (e) to the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.494" offset="4593351">Congress wanted to overrule that loophole, which they considered loophole in the Sand Door decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.044" offset="4631594">Now when the amendments went in 1959, it was hotly contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.004" offset="4651342">Some Congressmen or Senators wanted to outlaw hot cargo agreements in all industries and introduce bills to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.771" offset="4686451">On the other hand, a group wanted to overrule Denver Building Trades and they wanted to wipe out all probations against secondary picketing at the site of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.032" offset="4751548">The bills that were designed to overrule building trades, Denver Building Trades were rejected by both houses of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.213" offset="4776208">The bills passed by the senate and the house contained no special rules for the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.331" offset="4800658">The bills went to conference, and out of the conference report we find that a proviso was added for the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.088" offset="4839737">The proviso to Section 8 (e), Section 8 (e) outlawed in all hot cargo agreements for proviso for agreements at the site of construction. On the face of the proviso one would believe that it could cover any agreement at the site of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.253" offset="4912358">Your Honors when you read that legislative history, it's set forth in our briefs and I believe I read every page of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.542" offset="4945586">The legislative history overwhelmingly shows that Congress intended several things about the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.563" offset="4977664">One, that it only applied to voluntary agreements, not coercive agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.376" offset="5000861">When Senator Kennedy reported back to the Senate from the conference report, he said that the proviso to 8 (e) is not intended to change the law with respect to picketing at an construction site, that Denver Building Trades is still good law, that Sand Door is good law, that the proviso was to preserve the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.661" offset="5089991">In other words, what was legal to a construction industry union prior to 1959 remained legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.897" offset="5118934">They came out with nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.349" offset="5128756">All it had was that -- which we brought out in Sand Door was the right to enter into a voluntary boycott agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.951" offset="5171179">Congressman Barden reported back to the House, said it preserves the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.171" offset="5200018">That legislative history indicates to me, and I believe it will to you that it envisioned an employer-employee relationship, not agreements made outside of the employer-employee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.994" offset="5259368">Congress never in their wildest dreams would have figured that to do so they would have wiped out for the construction industry which is what this agreement does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.925" offset="5295104">All of the secondary boycott bans, all of the employee rights under Section 7 runs contrary the whole act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.034" offset="11755499">They say if we are successful that means all the contractors will be union contractors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.915" offset="11959045">Well there is no suggestion that we were trying to create a monopoly for that favored group in this record; and that was the nature of the contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.356" offset="12004812">I suppose it would be foolish to say that its not conceivable if there were some spin off benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.151" offset="12031979">There is always to make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.157" offset="12035950">It seems me the argument is it's a direct benefit for us; one if we are -- it's our reason for being that is to protect the wages of our members, and to increase the work opportunities and, we are appropriately prepared to well community non-union contractor who wants to share in giving his employees those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.477" offset="12109302">I am not sure I have any more time -- I wanted to say one of things, it seems about the nature of the argument made by the antitrust, argument made Connell and that is it seems to what they really are trying to do is resurrect the primary secondary dichotomy as an antitrust determinant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.484" offset="12201357">I think what their reply brief says specifically that is the absence of the employer, employee relationship between Local 100 and Connell that gives rise to antitrust complications, but that precisely what, we did away with I assume in Norris-LaGuardia and what this Court has said, each time since then, or since Hutcheson that it is no longer relevant in the antitrust determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.027" offset="12303444">The interest of Local 100 is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.091" offset="12311698">Connell is the person who makes the decision about whether its members are going to get to work or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.769" offset="12326431">They can organize and organize as long as general contractors would not contract with unionized mechanical contractors, they have no work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.460" offset="12357256">And as I say putting back in focus for me at least, their argument, Connell's argument is a redefinition of the term labor dispute in Norris-LaGuardia and a redefinition of the term labor dispute which is identical in the labor act to insist once again that there most be a proximate relationship between the dispute of employers employee, is essentially what they are saying to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.529" offset="12461537">And stated on the other side of it, I can see -- the Chamber of Commerce has filed the brief here in support of Connell which it says it would be perfectly lawful for the carpenters union to enter a contract with Connell saying that Connell would not subcontract any work of any kind, plumbers work, electricians work through any but union contractors and that, that would be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.154" offset="12555995">I fail to see any significant difference in terms to add a competitive affect, if you were looking at for Sherman Act point of view, of that agreement which they concede to be lawful and ours which they attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.475" offset="12597269">In fact, I think ours is really more relevant to the needs of the people involved, that is the plumbers local is looking for its members' jobs and wages and yet the agreements that they would concede to be lawful seem to me have just as much, if not more danger of anti competitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.938" offset="12671143">It is not accurate to state that in 1959, Congress decided that it would be unlawful for 8 (e) agreements to be attained by coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.790" offset="12726523">Quite the contrary, and we didn't cite in our brief although we had should have, a post-legislative history by Senator Goldwater is explicit that this question of coercion to obtain construction industry agreements was one that Congress left unresolved intentionally in adopting 8 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.832" offset="12826728">The courts, the five circuits I believe now that have faced the question as well as a labor board and uniformly said that picketing to obtain such agreements is lawful in the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.891" offset="12890885">Historically this record contains testimony from the Los Angeles Building &amp; Construction Trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.268" offset="12924426">The LA Building Trades had sought and obtained the agreements of this kind, much like the one that I referred in the current board case, back before Taft-Hartley, that was the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.923" offset="12967058">The Building Trade's council is not a bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.943" offset="12975104">The bargaining agents are the various craft unions; and yet building trade agreements of this kind predate, Taft-Hartley, that's record evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.895" offset="13010944">The LA Building Trades Agreement has been before the NLRB in a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.493" offset="13037380">Church's Fried Chicken which we cite in our brief most recent case which I have just mentioned to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.523" offset="13061413">Looking back at old antitrust doctrines frankly I cannot see the difference between this case and the Teamsters -- Milkwagon Drivers v. Lake Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.335" offset="13096730">In Lake Valley the dairy drivers think they are being threatened by a system of vending milk in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.445" offset="13129122">So they go put economic pressure on retail outlets and say do not buy, by picketing, threats and coercion, do not buy any longer from these dairies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.994" offset="13167365">When they acquiesced, they take the pressure of and that has been no antitrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.278" offset="13188472">A Second Circuit case belaboring in Griggs, ones which was here at one point Supreme Court where the Iron Workers Union in New York threaten by what was called the Iron League a non-union open shop, Iron worker erections companies went to owner's contract, general contractors, architects, threaten labor difficulties, if they did not agree not to use, non-union iron working firms in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.395" offset="13296933">And this is just what -- this is the typical pattern, that has emerged in this industry, one which has been traditionally sought -- traditionally thought to be exempt from antitrust which Congress we think in specifically addressing itself to the problem of this industry in 1947 and in 1959 made the conscious choice, that what is evil here, we are going to define with precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.776" offset="13394526">And it did define with precision as well as the evil as well as a remedy specifically rejecting the arguments that Antitrust sanctions should somehow be employed here to remedy the secondary boycott which were -- took by construction industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.993" offset="13835368">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.464" offset="13849266">Mr. Richard is suggesting that there is plenty of available remedies pursuant to the National Labor Relation act is like giving Connell snow in winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.540" offset="13881553">It's well known that the general counsel will not issue a compliant and NLRB couldn't decide it if they wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.067" offset="13915617">No way they can decide the question because the general counsel would not let them so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.123" offset="13935888">Going to the board is a useless act and as I said in my brief, I might as well file in a waste basket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.878" offset="13962846">Now let's look what is this agreement addressed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.893" offset="13974967">Mr. Richard says the agreement is addressed to benefit union members directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.175" offset="14000044">The affect of the agreement is not to benefit members, union members direct, if it was look and take actions against those who employ their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.834" offset="14042676">The affect of the agreement is to drive subcontractors, our manufactures who furnish and install products at the construction site out of the market, unless they'll come into Local 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.202" offset="14100146">That is the affect of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.706" offset="14110177">If it were addressed to the immediate employer employee relationship they may well have a point, but it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.282" offset="14144449">Connell, if his carpenters should entered into a collective bargain agreement, which he has one with the carpenters, they have got their work to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.523" offset="14189484">And if they make limitations on subbing out their work and if he gives it up and collective bargaining for whatever scale of value he puts on it, that rises out of collecting bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.000" offset="14235355">There is something to trap back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.563" offset="14245595">And employer employee negotiations which the whole labor act is designed to falls to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.521" offset="14269419">Step it outside of the employer employee relationship with the 50 cent piece of cardboard and a picket sign either the contractor signs up and agrees to assist the union to drive all other, all open shop mechanical contractors out of the market or else the general contractor goes broke, of course he cannot resist for long.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.049" offset="14363564">So Your Honors I believe it when we really look at effective agreement let us look at who are they addressing it to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.368" offset="14388851">They are not addressing to those who employ their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.899" offset="14402957">They are going without, and going outside of that source to lock up this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.422" offset="14429080">No I do not care whether we call it a conspiracy, I do not believe you do either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.384" offset="14444857">There is still lot of secrecy in the term conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.505" offset="14457396">Let us just call it a contract, let us look at the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.530" offset="14473488">Our written contract, Connell will not do business with anybody that do not have agreement with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.358" offset="14504835">Call it a combination, we have got a labor party and non-labor party combining, our conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.009" offset="14535450">I do not believe this man makes this much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.086" offset="14543705">I think we have a clear cut contract in restrain of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.322" offset="14556662">I believe there is no immunity when you take and compare the affects of the agreement with National Labor Policy.</text>
