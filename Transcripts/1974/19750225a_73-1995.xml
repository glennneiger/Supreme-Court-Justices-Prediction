            <text syncTime="39.914" offset="262980">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.109" offset="275832">This case is a federal habeas corpus action brought by award of the California Youth Authority who is currently in constructive custody on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.429" offset="309060">It presents into Court in question under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and this question is whether a juvenile such as the respondent Jones is placed twice in jeopardy when the juvenile court orders his trial as an adult after an adjudication of delinquency and upon a finding that he's unfit for treatment as a juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.313" offset="412609">The facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.765" offset="422431">In a petition filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, respondent Jones was charged with the commission of an act which if committed by an adult would have constituted a robbery under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.437" offset="473109">At a jurisdictional or adjudicatory hearing on this petition, respondent Jones was found to have committed the robbery alleged in that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.854" offset="518771">We submit as far as this case is concerned to the Court that we treat this particular proceeding as a trial and I don't think there is any question of our agreement between the parties on that point that the jurisdictional or adjudicatory hearing is in every sense a Court trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.407" offset="592959">After this adjudicatory or jurisdictional hearing, a second hearing was held known as the dispositional hearing and at this hearing, the juvenile court had what amounts to four choices under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.027" offset="651473">He could place the juvenile on probation. He could commit the juvenile to a juvenile institution within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, in other words, a county camp for juveniles on one of the other county facilities available to a juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.520" offset="705494">He could order a commitment to the California Youth Authority or he could do what he did in this case, exercise his power under Welfare and Institutions Code Section 707 and that is transfer the case to the adult court for trial of the juvenile as an adult.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.629" offset="833912">I believe it was 21 at the time the statute was amended subsequent to this particular juvenile's transfer but he was 17 at the time of his transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.906" offset="902980">Well, I believe up until age 26 depending on whether or not there is a -- ultimately a proceeding under the -- if he was committed to the Youth Authority and he was ultimately came back at age 21 and was found that he's still constituted a danger to society under the particular sections involved in the Youth Authority, he could technically be committed up until age 26, I believe at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.008" offset="1015411">What type of hearing is the transfer hearing? Well basically, I think that transfer hearing is set out in the case of Jimmy H. In other words, there are number of factors to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.093" offset="1059715">The first factor, of course the factor that's expressly precluded is just taking a look at the gravity of the offense alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.666" offset="1086046">California statute expressly provides that that alone is not enough for transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.587" offset="1105690">What the Judge will look at are three factors under the Jimmy H. case and those three factors are, first, he takes a look at the circumstances of the offense that is involved and the circumstances of the offense, the circumstances that surround the offense in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.820" offset="1198686">He also takes a look at the juvenile's prior conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.498" offset="1209344">In other words, any of his behavior pattern whether or not as in this case he had committed prior crimes that came within the juvenile court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.975" offset="1239228">In this case, respondent Jones had committed two prior armed robberies.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.585" offset="1285726">Hence, providing all the California Juvenile Court proceedings and of course that isn't the mandate of course as we would read the combination of Gault and Kent.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.990" offset="1415293">In other words, in the sense of findings of fact and conclusions of lost such as you'd have on a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.242" offset="1436296">Basically, the report, the probation report if it's held at the end of the transfer hearing as in this case is before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.900" offset="1470986">He has the testimony and at that point he makes his decision and he may state the factors that guide him as far as transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.048" offset="1499512">I don't think there is any express requirement in California Law that all those factors be placed on the record at the present time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Russel Iungerich</label>
            <text syncTime="360.403" offset="1544965">Well, I think it's quite clear in this case as far as the disposition hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.007" offset="1563355">The findings were that the primary reason that he felt that this man should be transferred was the fact that he had committed two other armed robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.291" offset="1592508">That he had been committed to juvenile institutions in both of those cases and that basically, he wasn't amenable to the juvenile court process for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.108" offset="1623855">I think it's a clear case of non-amenability as under any standard that would be applied in that type of hearing.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="386.332" offset="1648724">I take it if there were dispute of fact as to one of these important notes, there would be a finding?</text>

            <text syncTime="394.021" offset="1679444">If there was a dispute of fact, I would assume that the judge would state his reason as to why he was finding one way or another but under the California rules as this would come up appeal of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.631" offset="1725942">If there was evidence on the record that would support the ultimate result that the judge reached, then of course those implied findings would be what the California Court would rely on in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.517" offset="1773484">I think though that basically, the point that you brought out here is one that I think is very important as far as consideration the nature of the question involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.730" offset="1810265">Basically, what double jeopardy means in this particular -- in the context of this particular case is that a hearing is foreclosed at any point except prior to the adjudicatory hearing on the question of transfer and the question that really come -- the double jeopardy issue really is determinative of as whether or not the state should be permitted the flexibility to have the hearing either before or after and I think arguments can be made for a preferential -- for a preference one way or another depending upon the individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.968" offset="1939205">I submit that where you have a serious felony as robbery or murder or rape, you have a likelihood a contest of fact and although technically we're not consider quilt or innocence at the transfer hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.026" offset="1999496">Nevertheless, the judge is going to want to know the facts involved in this -- the questions will need to go into the same question of fact that would be involved --</text>

            <text syncTime="499.783" offset="2102523">What we do is we save the possibility of having three proceedings and we only have two if we permit the alternative, the disposition or alternative of allowing transfer after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.332" offset="2144737">Basically what you have if you don't have the disposition or alternative after trial, what were the advantage of the disposition or alternative if there are contested issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.534" offset="2709504">I do not recall whether Bryan went off on California grounds and I don't think they did discuss the California constitution although that option was available to the court in applying -- in deciding the constitutional question before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.509" offset="2765406">But basically, the rule in California today is that the hearing may be held either before or after and double jeopardy really comes down to the question, must it be limited only before under the constitutional compulsion of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.299" offset="2840534">I submit that that question indicate -- the resolution of that question really turns on the fact that although respondent Gary Steven Jones was tried twice in this particular case and I submit that the submission on the preliminary transcript of the adult case, he was in effect tried twice and that is the equivalent of a trial under California law because the judge determined all the issues of fact based on the preliminary transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.507" offset="2953383">Nevertheless, although he was tried twice, he was not placed in jeopardy twice and I think the critical distinction here is what is the critical question is what is a jeopardy for the purposes of this case because even if jeopardy had attached to the point of transfer and even if double jeopardy applied in the extent of saying that jeopardy does attach in the juvenile court, respondent Jones was not placed twice in jeopardy under the circumstance of this case for the primary reason first that none of the policies behind neither the protections that the -- are incorporated in the double jeopardy provision were violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.624" offset="3097893">North Carolina versus Pierce, those protections were set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.329" offset="3116701">The first was that double jeopardy protects against the second prosecution after acquittal and of course I think subsumed in that ground is also what is tantamount to acquittal, the dismissal at some point prior to acquittal where there isn't manifest necessity for the dismissal and the termination of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.563" offset="3185664">In this case, there was no acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.976" offset="3195277">There was nothing tantamount if anything what we had here was something that was tantamount to a conviction without a sentence and there's never been a situation where the court has held that it -- where there actually has not been a termination of proceedings, that there was actually a jeopardy at a first jeopardy at that point and the commencement of a second jeopardy where you do have some sort of continuum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.044" offset="4163584">The difference between the proceedings of course and the reason why we have to conduct a second adult trial is that all of the basic rights that are recorded to an adult criminal defendant have not been incorporated into the juvenile court process, particularly under McKeiver, the right of jury trial and in order to accord the juvenile that those rights before he is actually convicted in adult court, we have to give him the second adult trial as California views the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.449" offset="4277164">But I think the important point here is that in analyzing the protections of the Constitution that we have no -- of double jeopardy and the protections that it gives, really, what we have here is a situation where if any of the protections that are mentioned in North Carolina versus Pearce apply, it would have to be the protection against a second conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.688" offset="4366085">But I think that basically the language, the understanding of that I have of the protection against a second conviction is this, that you actually have to have two separate and distinct risks of punishment and in this case there is one risk of punishment throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.518" offset="4445393">When the petition was filed in juvenile court proceedings, at the very beginning of this case in California, the petition -- the respondent was under -- on notice that the possibility of transfer and the possibility of an adult criminal sentence was in that case and until he was actually committed to the facilities of the juvenile court that risk did not depart the case, all at the point that the case is transferred, the only thing that departs the case is not the higher risk of punishment that's involved in the adult criminal proceedings but the lesser punishments that would be involved or the lesser disposition of being kept in juvenile court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.639" offset="4645909">Its really what you might say is the converse of the Green situation in Green versus United States where there in the initial case there was a verdict of guilty with regard to second-degree murder which meant an implicit acquittal of first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.108" offset="4727829">There after the state tried to retry Green for first-degree murder unless held that there was some type of implicit acquittal, you could not be retried under the Double Jeopardy Clause for the higher crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.259" offset="6468420">The point is, with those cases though is that the ones that are considered for transfer and we don't know how many, first of all, there are no statistics on the number of waiver hearings that are actually held in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.304" offset="6588583">I think there's no question, the both sides on this case agree on the fact that the juvenile courts already have overcrowded dockets and by adding this particular -- taking out this possibility of giving the flexibility to actually avoid two duplicate trials in this circumstance may really cut in to their discretion and actually lead to more congestion on their calendars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.710" offset="6694222">I think that as well as the indication that there is no violation of the principles of double jeopardy, I think as well the continuing jeopardy exception would give us an additional peg on which to decide that this case does not violate the double jeopardy provision of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.838" offset="7030680">Even the retrial cases, I don't think uniformly go off on the question of waiver and indeed I think Green rejected the waiver theory in its analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.060" offset="7595656">I would like initially to respond just briefly to a couple of questions that you asked my adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.817" offset="7626689">First of all, Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, in an answer to your question about how many transfers there are actually are in California of the latest statistics from 1972, shall ask if they're available indicate that there are approximately -- there are exactly 509 transfers out of 50,000 delinquency cases so only 1% of the cases result in transfer to adult court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.568" offset="7713625">Secondly, I would resist the characterization of the fitness hearing in California as a duplicate trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.476" offset="7753226">The cases in the statutes are quite clear in pointing out that a fitness hearing has nothing to do with the minor's guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.580" offset="7785723">Under California law, you're merely attempting to determine first whether the minor is over the age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.856" offset="7810800">Secondly, whether the minor is charged with a criminal law violation, and thirdly, whether the minor would be amenable to the treatment programs or training facilities available to the juvenile court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.434" offset="7861060">In fact, the statute says that a minor cannot be waived on the basis of his guilt or innocence of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.251" offset="7884361">It's not a sole criterion and cannot be used as a criterion for waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.266" offset="8616417">I suppose in most cases the court would hear although technically perhaps it might be considered almost irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.865" offset="8662810">This minor has been placed in jeopardy in two quite different respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.169" offset="8680051">First of all, he's been tried twice, the very same offense and this -- there's no dispute about and our basic position is and I think this is confirmed by numerous opinions of this Court that a Double Jeopardy Clause protects a defendant and let us not forget that this is a convicted defendant, a minor who's been convicted of a felony, although the Double Jeopardy Clause protects the defendant against possibility of two prosecutions for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.633" offset="8781928">Quite irrespective of the penalties that might be opposed, he suffered the anxiety, the insecurity, the expense, etcetera of two trials for the very same crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.208" offset="8824247">Secondly, he was exposed to a considerably more severe penalty at the conclusion of his felony trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.688" offset="8862072">The maximum penalty that could be imposed by the juvenile court in this case was to commit the minor to the California Youth Authority until age 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.184" offset="8896136">The maximum penalty that he faced in his adult trial on the other hand was a mandatory sentence of from five years to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.891" offset="8934902">So he is certainly in a position of having faced a very severe jeopardy in terms of the penalty that could be imposed by the adult court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.124" offset="8967920">Now, in this case, the adult court shows to commit him to the California Youth Authority and it's quite incorrect to believe that that means that he has the same sentence as an adult that he would have had as a juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.609" offset="9021837">As a juvenile, he could only be held by the Youth Authority until age 21, as a convicted felon, he may be held by the Youth Authority until age 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.362" offset="9060812">At present time, the minor is on parole, from the Youth Authority, he is 22 and a half years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.044" offset="9087561">If indeed he had been sent there by the Youth Authority, he would already be free, excuse me, by the juvenile court, he would be free of the juvenile court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.277" offset="9128521">There's another aspect in which he's been exposed not only to a more severe punishment but in fact a double punishment and that is, he has been held in juvenile hall for approximately three extra weeks as a result of his totally unnecessary jurisdictional hearing in juvenile court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.407" offset="9196962">Under California Law, he will receive no credit and has received no credit towards his commitment in the Youth Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.936" offset="9223084">So, we have three different respects in which this minor has been placed in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.766" offset="9242415">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you asked the question of my colleague over here before about whether a minor could be transferred after an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.277" offset="9276479">I think that that question is open under California law but I would point out that there's nothing in the transfer statute that precludes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.660" offset="9306049">And as far as I know, there is no California case that is directly on point.</text>
