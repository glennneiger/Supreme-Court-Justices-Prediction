            <label>Mr. Moses Lasky</label>
            <text syncTime="15.104" offset="163819">-- and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.621" offset="173850">This case concerns the jurisdictional requirements of interstate commerce in three Sections of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.581" offset="205720">Section 2 which is the Robinson-Patman Act, Section 3 which is the provision prohibiting certain tie-in arrangements and Section 7 which is commonly called the Celler-Kefauver Act or Amendment which has to do with mergers and acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.590" offset="277713">The case does not involve any question at all of what Congress’ has powers are.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.363" offset="300805">It involves no question what Congress can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.366" offset="312822">It only involves the question of what in fact it has seen fit to do by the legislation it has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.311" offset="340616">Now the starting point, I assume of any consideration of what an act of Congress means is the language of the Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.560" offset="373635">The jurisdictional requirements of the three Acts that I speak of are much the same and are to be contrasted with the provision of the Sherman Act because they are much narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.687" offset="422118">Now, each one of these three Acts, each one requires that the proscribed conduct have an effect and an impact on interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.331" offset="460675">Now, I'll use the word “commerce” hereafter for interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.108" offset="475826">The language of the three is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.744" offset="486379">It is required that the “effect maybe substantially to lessen competition or attempt to create a monopoly in the line of commerce” and in this respect these three are identical with the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.314" offset="544580">They require an effect or impact on interstate commerce, but the Sherman Act requires no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.845" offset="570702">Under the Sherman Act it makes no difference who commits the conduct or where it occurs if it has an effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.058" offset="603617">But here under these three Clayton Act Sections, much more is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.118" offset="623888">Effect or impact which is expressly spelled out and required is only one of several of the tests of jurisdiction mandated by these Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.169" offset="668087">Robinson-Patman requires, in addition to the effect or impact, that the discriminatory sale would be and I quote “by a person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce” and again a discrimination requires at least two sales to have a discrimination between it requires “either or any of the purchasers involved must be in commerce,” that’s in addition to the Effect or Impact Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.603" offset="781772">Section 3 has almost the identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.170" offset="792012">It requires that the tie-in conduct be that of a “person engaged in commerce in the course of such commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="181.243" offset="828374">In Section 7, the anti-acquisition section, requires not only that the effect be adverse on a line of commerce, but that the acquiring corporation be “a corporation engaged in commerce” and in addition, that the acquired corporation be a corporation engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.503" offset="909354">Now, before we go further to discuss the effect of the Act besides from this case, it's necessary to find out what product we’re talking about because that's the key to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.992" offset="951359">The product involved in this case is a substance known as asphaltic concrete, not asphalt.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.355" offset="976750">And I emphasize it is not liquid asphalt because liquid asphalt moves in interstate commerce and while this case started is one of what later became a consolidated as the Western Liquid Asphalt cases, the trial court carved out the asphaltic concrete aspects of it and left the liquid asphalt aspect still going, they're still in the Court, they're still proceeding with the rest of the Western Liquid Asphalt cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.161" offset="1076015">Asphaltic concrete, let me say when the Court carved it out, the Court said at the beginning there seem to be a jurisdictional element upon asphaltic concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.156" offset="1116035">It directed the plaintiff to take all the discovery he needed on the jurisdictional elements, come back and make a showing and when that occurred, the Court ruled out the asphaltic concrete elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.279" offset="1156472">Asphaltic concrete is a product made in California and which by its very nature cannot be sold across the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.252" offset="1192417">It's a bulky product, composed of 95% of rocks, sand and gravel which is mined in the local pits and the other 5% is liquid asphalt, also produced in California from California refineries.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.495" offset="1245393">This material is used as a topping, black top, streets, roadways, driveways.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.899" offset="1270993">In order to make it, you mix the rock with hot asphalt in a hot plant and the product has to be laid down before it cools.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.858" offset="1302758">Consequently, it has to be laid down within 35 miles from the plant where it's made.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.132" offset="1331911">That means it can't move in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.688" offset="1342151">The hot plants of all the parties in this case are located in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.848" offset="1362735">The hot plants of the plaintiff were all located in the Los Angeles basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.319" offset="1380603">The hot plants of the acquired corporation involved in the Section 7 aspect of this case, Sully-Miller are all located in the Los Angeles basin, that is to say Los Angeles County and the suburbs around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.850" offset="1438804">None of the asphaltic concrete made or sold involved in this case ever got within 200 miles of an interstate border of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.893" offset="1474957">Now, the Robinson-Patman in Section 3 accounts concerns sales of asphaltic concrete by the petitioner, industrial asphalt.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.006" offset="1503378">It is accused of having discriminated and yet none of its asphaltic concrete sales ever got within 200 miles from the California border.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.360" offset="1552802">None of never crossed the state line, none of never could cross a state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.717" offset="1574222">Now, the Section 7 count involves the acquisition by Union Oil Company which is not in the asphaltic concrete business of one Sully-Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.396" offset="1616959">Sully-Miller has its plants solely in Los Angeles County and the neighborhood of Orange County and makes asphaltic concrete from local materials, sells it within a 35 mile range from Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.351" offset="1668786">It also engages as a paving contractor and the complaint, the amended complaint in this case alleged that Sully-Miller's business was engaged -- being engaged primarily in the business of operating asphaltic concrete, hot plants and contracting street improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.123" offset="1739839">It's a street paver and all -- this appears at the appendix of Page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.945" offset="1763140">It is plants from the Los Angeles basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.570" offset="1773693">It's a contractor in paving streets in that particular area, all 200 miles or thereabouts from the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.556" offset="1801592">Now upon this state of undisputed fact, the District Court ruled that the jurisdictional requirements of Sections 2, 3 and 7 were absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.627" offset="1837850">It said that the Robinson-Patman Act did not apply because no sale by industrial of asphaltic concrete was in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.704" offset="1874213">No sale was made in the course of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.502" offset="1889364">For the same reason they held that the Section 3, the tie-in section did not apply and it held that Section 7 did not apply to Union's acquisition of Sully-Miller for the simple reason that Sully-Miller was not a corporation engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.727" offset="1950281">I may add that the District Court also found there wasn't any effect on interstate commerce and it had given the plaintiff, the petitioner every opportunity show their jurisdictional facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.019" offset="1995421">This case went to the Court of Appeals on an interlocutory appeal, allowed under 1292-B and that Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.031" offset="2027499">Now, until the decision in this case, it had been the uniformed decision of a mass of cases, the Robinson-Patman does not apply unless at least one of the sales, involving a discrimination crosses a state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.934" offset="2087058">The Court of Appeals dismissed this state line test and it did it because it said asphaltic concrete is used on streets and roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.673" offset="2122062">Streets and roads of all hook up and eventually something crosses the state line, so you have an interstate highway system.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.831" offset="2150693">Therefore, the roads and the streets are linked up to “an instrumentality of commerce” and therefore said it as a matter of law, the seller and the sale are engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.445" offset="2201161">As for Sully-Miller, it held that as a matter of law, it was engaged in commerce because it sold asphaltic concrete for use on roads and because it paved streets, as I say all 200 miles from an interstate border.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.570" offset="2257690">Now, the Ninth Circuit ignored the finding of no effect on the interstate commerce because it said that because an interstate instrumentality of commerce was involved a road, everybody was engaged in commerce and if you're engaged in commerce the effect for all those as a matter of law, I'm not going to discuss that.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.726" offset="2326235">This Court, we petitioned for cert -- on the certiorari upon the Sherman Act issue and certiorari was not allowed on that so that's not before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.448" offset="2365210">The proposition we advance now is that the judgment and decision was wrong because no sales were made in commerce by anybody engaged in commerce and nobody engaged in commerce was acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.013" offset="2411395">Now, just this year on May 24th, the Fifth Circuit in Scranton Construction versus Litton Industries reported in 494 F2d 778 referred to the decision below the very one I'm here on now, it referred to it as a “new deliverance” and refused to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.760" offset="2498435">Now, this Court granted certiorari to review this new rule of law and yet now that we're here, the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is barely defended.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.298" offset="2544515">The Solicitor General has filed an amicus brief the other day in which he urges that Sections 3 and 7 should be read as if they were coextensive with the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.040" offset="2591535">In other words, you delete all of the language above sales in commerce, but in the course of commerce by a corporation engaged in commerce and treat the Acts as if they required no more than the Sherman Act and curiously enough he says nothing about the Robinson-Patman Act, he just talks about Section 3 and Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.287" offset="2680560">We know of course that the Department of Justice in the antitrust division had never been lovers of the Robinson-Patman Act and apparently they don't seem to defend the decision, but the language of those Sections were all the same and whatever decision is made about 3 or 7, would of necessity have apply the Robinson-Patman Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.507" offset="2757360">The principal argument made in respondent’s brief is exactly the same as the Solicitor's General, namely that with respect to all of these Acts, Robinson-Patman 2 and 7, they should be read as expansively as the Sherman Act and that nothing is required other than effect on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.948" offset="2835205">Now, if I maybe forgiven to characterize them, I would say that these two lines of argument are, 1, would work surgery by excising the specific provisions of Robinson-Patman Sections 3 and 7 and the other, that of the Court below is applying LSD to the language and get -- arriving at a rather strange interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.463" offset="2937187">Now, let me turn to the reason in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.497" offset="2953383">The great Chief Justice Treanor of California once wrote about the use of magic words as if the use of a certain phraseology, somehow decided the case and I respectfully submit that that’s what the Ninth Circuit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.373" offset="3008867">It picks up the words, interstate highway which has an inflated sound divorced from reality, but tax -- a compulsive significance to that and then also we'll look for analogy to the Fair Labor Standards Act which is an Act of quite different language, purpose and background.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.271" offset="3084413">The Court below talks about interstate highways and if the Court please, that is not a legal term.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.337" offset="3108760">It is a loose terminology for roads, for whose construction the Federal Government under grant made statute, the Federal Highway Aid Act contributes money.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.121" offset="3151809">It does so for forest roads, trails, farm to market roads, local rural roads, streets, parkways, county roads, and also state roads selected to connect the principal centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.982" offset="3203323">Respondent called on the petitioners to admit by request for admission and we did admit that 98.5% of these funds received by the State of California went to county roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.137" offset="3247940">We've already observed that Sully-Miller was a street paver in the suburbs of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.595" offset="3277720">All roads for which Federal Aid is given are under the jurisdiction of the state, local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.860" offset="3298826">Federal Act, the Aid Highway Act does not presume to regulate highways or operations of those working on them or supplying materials for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.451" offset="3337174">It does do more than attached conditions with a gift and none of those conditions have anything to do with the problems of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.822" offset="3366640">And so I respectfully submit that what the decision of the Court below comes to is to advance this proposition, “since every street in every city and every road anywhere in United States unless it connects with other is part of an interstate network of highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.887" offset="3442918">Therefore, the seller of anything used in a street or a road is in commerce and by that reasoning the local society for the care over the blind that sells brooms made by the blind for use to sweeping the streets or the streets cleaner, or the tow truck operator who removes illegally parked cars on the streets, all are engaged in commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="856.128" offset="3527868">Now, this Court over and over again in its interstate commerce decisions has said that the conception -- the concept of commerce is guided by the most practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.813" offset="3582621">Commerce is an intensely practical concept drawn from the normal and accepted course of business, these are statements the Court has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.300" offset="3616580">Now, if this case concerned workers constructing a lock across the canal or a draw bridge across the Mississippi, one might see such an immediacy to their operation of an interstate facility that you might come to the conclusion there practically that the construction of that bridge was an interstate commerce, but I submit that from any practical reality, selling asphaltic concrete to put on a street or a road, 200 miles from the border simply is a horse of another color and so of paving a city street.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.194" offset="3772165">Now, if the Court please, we get back to our fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.851" offset="3782823">Our system of government is federalism, certainly where a federal statute plainly applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.767" offset="3810408">It has to be applied, but when to apply it is going to intrude upon local policies and to apply it requires some procrustean treatment, some stretching then we've been taught by the decisions of this Court that the hand is stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.648" offset="3881984">Now, the philosophy of the Robinson-Patman Act is a highly debatable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.199" offset="3900165">This Court has frequently commented how it is in conflict with the philosophy of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.034" offset="3919496">California is considered that Robinson-Patman and has deliberately refused to adapt the Robinson-Patman type statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.286" offset="3948544">California's Supreme Court reviewing the matter has said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.291" offset="3964531">California has no Robinson-Patman type of statute and has noted this conflict of policy and yet what has happened here is that a Federal Act has been extended in the California area to something local on misconception that asphaltic concrete is put upon a road.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.045" offset="4031509">Now if the Court please, California also has not adapted any general anti-acquisition statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.867" offset="4062856">The proposed uniform state antitrust law has deliberately left out a Section 7 type of provision on the idea that acquisitions at a local level have a different impact and deal with different kind of policies and on a national level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.328" offset="4136730">So we say again, the question here is not how far Congress could go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.436" offset="4153135">I think Congress could go to full length here if it wished to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.332" offset="4164733">How far has it gone and in deciding that question, respect has to be paid first to the language Congress has used and secondly, to the Federal structure of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.115" offset="5419865">That's a different case and the decision we asked the Court to render here is not going to be the last decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.253" offset="5444420">It’s going to be asked to rendering in questions like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.662" offset="5466049">Now, the second advice from the reasoning of the Court below is that it appeals to the analogy of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.435" offset="5501158">That Act provides for minimum wages not only to employees engaged in commerce, but also to employees “engaged in the production of goods for commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.985" offset="5547342">And this Court by a divided decision held that the last words even meant engaged in the production of goods for those engaged in commerce based upon the particular legislative history of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.810" offset="5606588">Amendments to that Act, divided definitions whereby if some employees who are engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, all employees of the same employer are deemed brought under the Act and Congress could do that sort of thing on Robinson-Patman in Section 3 and unquestionably on Section 7 if it wished to do so, but it hasn't done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.455" offset="5689240">Now, if the Court please, and this brings me to the Solicitor General's line of argument which I think I can answer very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.388" offset="5720900">Whenever Congress has got on legislate, conflicting views of politics, economics, sociology are pressed upon Congress, each one contending for an option and in the end Congress draws a line and makes compromises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.114" offset="5779832">Now, one can grant that legislation is to be given a scope commensurate with Congress’ purposes and aims, but Congress is the only judge not only of its goals but of the means it wishes to advance them and of the compromises it wishes to make among the contending factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.683" offset="5846079">And the only way Congress has to express the solution and the compromises that it's forced to make is in words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.976" offset="5875231">Now, here the words are absolutely clear, not to be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.134" offset="5891950">And talking about the Sherman Act, this Court for example in the Southeastern Underwriters case said the words of the Sherman Act were all comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.270" offset="5924446">Any person who restrains trade falls under the ban of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.269" offset="5948479">Here, we have an English language of body of terms each of separate meaning, each having an -- with an ascending order of reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.143" offset="5979930">We have in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.691" offset="5986095">We have production of goods for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.946" offset="5995186">We have production of a working on instrumentalities of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.549" offset="6009605">We have the words affecting commerce and each one reaches out a little further and the affecting commerce reaches out to the farthest extent of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.868" offset="6042833">These words compromise an armory from which Congress can draw when it wishes to express of its particular purpose and if the Court is to treat all these words as synonymous as you're being asked to do by the Solicitor General, I respectfully submit that corrupts the language, corrupts the law and it impoverishes Congress because it takes away from Congress words it can use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.810" offset="6142621">And if the Court should hold that the words selected so carefully by the legislative branch such as engaged in commerce, engaged in the course of commerce don't mean anymore than affecting commerce then Congress is going to be hard put to express itself when it doesn't wish to exercise the commerce power to its fullest extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.899" offset="6219003">It will be driven to circumlocution, negatives and provisos.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.366" offset="6236871">Now everybody knows the legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act demonstrates, that Robinson-Patman was the product of a complex series of legislative proposals ending up in compromises that have given many courts headaches in trying to resolve the meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.856" offset="6302804">I was quoting at that point from the Meyer Paving case in which this Court denied certiorari, recently in 414 US.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.550" offset="6381589">Approx -- yes, 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.577" offset="6397680">Enacted incidentally after this Court in the Bendheim Brothers case or the Darby case and the cases involving Labor Relations Act had explicated the far reach of power that Congress possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.414" offset="6448985">No doubt as to that this Court by the time Congress enacted this Act had told Congress that it had the most extensive power, nevertheless, there was no extension or change in these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.791" offset="6490572">Similarly, in Celler-Kefauver in 1951 -- 50, they didn't change the words that they used in 1914 despite the fact that they could have and gone much further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.946" offset="6539160">I submit the case with this submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.238" offset="6552325">The Congress of the United States still sits and if it is of view, the Department of Justice or others, these three Acts should be made extensive in their reach with the Sherman Act, they can go over to Congress and try to get them enacted and go through all the debates that will occur before the various legislative committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.788" offset="6630484">But in the time we just been going through a period when everybody has been much concerned that the several departments of the government stay within our own proper ambit and at a time like that that's where they should go to Congress not to this Court.</text>
