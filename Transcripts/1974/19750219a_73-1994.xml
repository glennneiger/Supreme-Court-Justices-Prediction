            <text syncTime="12.480" offset="153266">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.359" offset="160789">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.030" offset="171447">At the conclusion of yesterday afternoon's session, I was reciting the facts of this case and I will not go over those again for they are set forth in the counter statement of facts in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.157" offset="227976">I will continue by saying that in February of 1970, the petitioner filed a suit in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division with a count for negligence under the Jones Act and a count alleging unseaworthiness of the vessel under the General Maritime Law and a count for maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.129" offset="307911">The jury decided adversely to the petitioner on the issue of liability, finding the accident was due to his sole negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.768" offset="346467">They also found that petitioner was entitled to a maintenance and cure award for the period from June 29, 1968, the day he left the vessel until June 29, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.286" offset="400488">Respondent moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and petitioner moved for attorney's fees and interests and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.242" offset="436328">Both motions were denied by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.369" offset="456808">Petitioner then appealed to the Sixth Circuit as to the first cause of action pertaining to the negligence under the Jones Act and to unseaworthiness under the General Maritime Law of the jury verdict of no cause for action.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.916" offset="523055">Respondent filed with an appeal as to the propriety of the maintenance and cure award.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.037" offset="547506">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the jury verdict of no cause for action as to the liability question and reversed as to the maintenance and cure question.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.819" offset="602676">On appeal, respondent argued at the trial level that petitioner went to great lengths to show that he suffered the vestibular disorder or condition when he left the vessel on June 28 or June 29, 1968 and that such was due to the accident which he alleged occurred in early April of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.199" offset="696195">Quoting from the opinion of the Sixth Circuit which states respondent's position with succinctness, we read, “The defendant contends that the plaintiff’s injury was permanent from the date of the accident and was never susceptible of curative treatment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="167.683" offset="774144">Dr. Heil testified that although he could not determine from his examination what had caused the vestibular disorder, a severe blow to the head could have caused his problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.605" offset="821791">Presumably, the jury concluded that it was plaintiff's fault that caused the disorder and the disabling dizziness and headaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.428" offset="853034">However, the evidence clearly shows that a vestibular disorder is not a condition that can be cured or improved by treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.640" offset="889919">When asked whether plaintiff might be cured by treatment, Dr. Heil, testified, “No, not really.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.974" offset="919280">Treatment is primarily symptomatic for this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.506" offset="933386">That is, people with a vestibular disorder are apt to have intermittent episodes of dizziness which on occasion are somewhat more severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.249" offset="968391">Treatment is limited to those times when the patient is particularly dizzy.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.288" offset="984482">They can obtain some symptomatic relief with medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.960" offset="999215">Other than that, there is no specific cure or treatment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="228.777" offset="1018441">No evidence was introduced in conflict with this conclusion of Dr. Heil.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.481" offset="1037249">The record in this case does not permit an inference other than that plaintiff's condition was permanent immediately after the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.047" offset="1079568">It is not even alleged that plaintiff has ever received treatment for the condition itself although he has received medicine for the symptoms of dizziness and headaches, that one may require or be helped by treatment for the symptoms of a disorder does not qualify him for maintenance and cure, Farrell versus United Stated at 519.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard C. Jaques</label>
            <text syncTime="1559.881" offset="6342928">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.403" offset="6357034">In response to matters posed to my brother, in further response, in another situation where a seaman is inflicted with illness and is put ashore and under a circumstance such as this where a vestibular labyrinthine disorder is of a permanent nature, incurable and he is put ashore and incurs medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.485" offset="6493288">I think Mr. Mundell has indicated well the shipowner though his benevolence even though it had no obligation would make those payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.086" offset="6531741">I submit that I would not place much stock on the benevolence of a ship owner who had no duty to make payments for medical expenses and I think that that really is the crucial part of the issue of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.532" offset="6609481">When liability of a shipowner to pay a seaman's maintenance and cure commences and when it ends, the Sixth Circuit has taken the bold position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.148" offset="6671966">And the position which unlocks -- submit humanism that if the incident renders the seaman unfit for duty at the occurrence and if it is found to be prominent, then the shipowner has no liability at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.882" offset="6774888">The maximum cure occurred, in the words of the Sixth Circuit, the moment that the trauma was inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.228" offset="6816266">The shipowner has stated here in response to a question with regard to this Court having stated in Farrell versus United Stated that there is no payment for maintenance and cure when the cure is palliative treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.197" offset="6932146">Now, I say this, my brother has indicated in his brief on page 14 a quotation stating that the rule in effect as stated by this Court and then he cites -- and then he recites, “Now, I'm sure that this inadvertence on Mr. Mundell's part but this Court did not make ever that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.070" offset="7075610">As a matter of fact, that statement came from a Texas Court -- Texas State Court in the case of Rey Lewis versus Isthmian Lines and that was the State of Texas -- it came out of the 1968 AMC 1688.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.742" offset="7214373">And so I submit that this Court has not made such a pronouncement relative to palliative treatment not being within the purview of the duration of liability of a shipowner to pay maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.305" offset="7316564">Just further, the United State Public Health Service has a statutory duty to provide care for ill and injured seamen who are afflicted during the service of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.341" offset="7376750">There is, however, a policy of the United States Public Health Service that if they find the seaman fit --for duty, and then 60 days expires or 90 days or whatever period that they have established, expires where the seaman has not been active, then he is no longer eligible and that was a situation with Vella and Vella thus became ineligible after that period of days and at that time it could have been 60 or 90, but whatever, it was period of days, and he was no longer eligible for public health --</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.615" offset="7721880">The only thing that I can say, Your Honor, in response to that is there was a period, approximately in that period of time, when the seaman was examined, by Dr. Benitus who was comparable to Dr. Heil and he is a specialist, although it was a period of time earlier, actually it was a trifle earlier than that two year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.362" offset="7840789">Now, in response further to Mr. Justice Brennan, with regard to the seaman's right to an appropriate period of time and other matters that are sought as relief in the brief of the petitioner, I submit, first of all, that this Court has declared way back, following Justice Story's declaration, of this court being, well a seaman is a ward of the Admiralty Court and as such, I submit that it's not unprecedented for an award to be made outside of the area of issues raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.722" offset="8030229">In regard to the matter of the appropriate order to issue relative to judgment, to be consistent with the law that is established pertaining to the duration, maintenance and cure, not only is it not unprecedented that the court even on it's own motion could make such a determination.</text>
