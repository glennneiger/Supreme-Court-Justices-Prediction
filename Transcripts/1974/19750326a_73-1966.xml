            <text syncTime="58.371" offset="336854">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.853" offset="350751">This, I think is the third time this proceeding has been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.632" offset="369873">I hope I can persuade you that it should be the last.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.401" offset="388995">The present posture of it involves basically two questions, the jurisdiction of the lower court to enter an order and on the merits whether the order was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.246" offset="444374">Because it has been the position of the intervening railroads whom I represent that the lower court lack jurisdiction and we have urged that.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.461" offset="481259">I'm speaking first and I will try and confine myself to the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.091" offset="503724">Mr. Randolph will deal with the merits should the Court reach them.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.572" offset="521697">Mr. Horsky, are you going to cover the jurisdiction of this Court as well as of the District Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_horsky" startTime="109.232" stopTime="372.902">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="109.232" offset="540296">I had hoped that I could rely on our briefs for that but I'll be glad to comment on it if you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.521" offset="565478">Let me put this case in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.748" offset="582405">The proceeding -- this proceeding began in 1972 and the course of events that the Court and at the Commission since that time is set out in our briefs in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.521" offset="637471">I think I can make the present posture of it clear in a very few words.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.928" offset="663071">At the 1972 term, this Court dealt with the problem of a temporary emergency surcharge which had been proposed by the railroads in early 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.183" offset="716152">As the Court is aware as the Chief Justice indicated in the preceding argument in the railroad industry tear of changes are made by the railroads and subject only to a power in the Commission to suspend for a period of seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.667" offset="786056">The rates proposed by the railroads go into effect as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.347" offset="804760">And they remain in effect unless and until the Commission itself finds them unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.630" offset="837883">In 1972 when the Commission declined to suspend the temporary emergency surcharge of this District Court, the same District Court we have now, enjoined the Commission to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.445" offset="889187">This Court reversed that decision on the ground of Arrow Transportation Company that the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with suspension orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.632" offset="929938">In the meantime, the railroads had replaced the 2.5% temporary emergency surcharge with a general 4% rate increase which became generally effective in October of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.315" offset="1000678">With one exception as applied to recyclables, the Commission did suspend the increase until June 1973 while it undertook a rather elaborate effort to further explore the environmental problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.872" offset="1082911">Shortly before 1970's, June 1973 when that 4% increase was to take effect on recyclables, the respondents here sought an injunction and the District Court again enjoined the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.309" offset="1156577">Again, this Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.979" offset="1171310">While that appeal by our side from that injunction was pending, the appellees, the respondents here sought declaratory judgment in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.465" offset="1221256">They sought two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.580" offset="1225644">They sought first, a declaration that the environmental impact statement prepared by the Interstate Commerce Commission was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.298" offset="1260544">And that therefore, its order allowing the rate increase is to go into effect was invalid and that the Commission should be directed to prepare a new environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.632" offset="1313938">And second, that the rate should be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.322" offset="1336613">A divided District Court this time for the first time concluded that it had jurisdiction to review the general revenue orders by reason of a supposed NEPA exception National Environmental Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.973" offset="1403277">It's too hard to say, that's NEPA if I may and that on the merits, the environmental impact statement as applied to recyclables was inadequate and must be read on by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.119" offset="1467852">It declined however to enjoined the collection of the rates and they are now being collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.603" offset="1493765">Now, that's the posture of the case as it now before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.295" offset="1516544">The respondents do urge Mr. Justice that there is no jurisdiction in this Court on two grounds that the order of the Commission was phrased in terms of setting aside rather than in enjoining the Commission, and that the case may be moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.510" offset="1833462">It's clear under the Urgent Deficiencies back in 1913 that it would be jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.789" offset="1854568">The revisers note say, they didn't intend any change in the Electronic Industries case.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.325" offset="1876720">The same point was briefed and argued to this Court and the Court would have had decided it in our motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.117" offset="1899813">They made a motion to dismiss the appeal on this ground and you did not reserve a question of jurisdiction of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.233" offset="1924263">I think there is not very much reason why I should be worried about those arguments at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.891" offset="1958954">The question of jurisdiction of the District Court as I say is really a very important question and I do want to talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.703" offset="2002213">I can state it very simply for about 40 years since a decision by Judge Chesnut in Baltimore and the Algoma case.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.834" offset="2062712">The district courts -- the federal district courts had declined jurisdiction when asked to review general revenue orders of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.837" offset="2102732">That is orders which are so-called Ex parte orders in which the railroads proposed a general across the board rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.907" offset="2166993">And in which the decision of the Commission as to whether or not to suspend the order, suspend the increases for the seven months period is really based on whether or not the railroads need additional revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.516" offset="2237419">It has nothing to do with whether the rates are just unreasonable in such cases and in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.910" offset="2266990">The Commission makes very clear that the rates which have been increased by the general revenue order can be challenged in a subsequent proceeding before the Commission under Section 13 or Section 15 by any party on any ground that will ordinarily be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.631" offset="2337938">And in the Algoma case as Judge Chesnut pointed out, the consequences that challenging them in the general revenue proceeding is premature and that the people are properly remitted to the procedure where the rates that actual legality of the rates can properly be test.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="579.798" offset="2422575">What if one wanted to challenge the Commission's determination that the railroads in fact needed more revenue?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_horsky" startTime="585.923" stopTime="627.733">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="585.923" offset="2447026">That would be open if the Commission had relied on it in its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.110" offset="2467819">In other words, you file a Section 13 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.384" offset="2480880">I mean a Section 13 complaint against the recyclable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.538" offset="2501569">The Commission has a hearing. It's mandated to have an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.519" offset="2517452">It's not optional, it must do it and it must come out with the decision as to whether or not the rates are just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.798" offset="2546604">If the Commission's decision is bottomed on the needs of the railroad, that is reviewable by the courts just like anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.239" offset="2576280">If the Commission does not rely on that, if that isn't an issue as to justness and reasonableness then it need not be reviewed because it isn't relevant anymore.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="627.733" offset="2614314">So, that wouldn't be an occasion for reviewing a general rate?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="631.897" offset="2630928">I should think no.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.894" offset="2634898">No, that's not any reason why you need to review a general revenue order because if it becomes a matter of issue in a particular case where the real issue is presented that is, is this a lawful rate to the extent that the needs of the revenue -- needs of the railroads for revenues enter into that determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="653.756" offset="2718386">It is reviewable just like any other consideration which enters into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.044" offset="2743568">The Algoma rule really is very similar to the more familiar role in the Arrow Transportation case which this Court accepted and applied in the previous decision in this case in that earlier SCRAP case.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.424" offset="2809083">That decision was as I say that the Arrow decision that courts will not review suspension orders of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.328" offset="2868642">Because the ICC has no general power to get to give prior approval to rates, these Ex parte proceedings, these general revenue proceedings are handled essentially the same way as to the suspension power.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.993" offset="2939382">General revenue orders don't determine whether the rate is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.558" offset="2957563">They leave that as does as a suspension order to a further administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.279" offset="2984521">Now, in this case, Judge Wright writing for himself and Judge Richey concluded not to follow the Algoma rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.708" offset="3022242">He had in fact, in 1970 dissented from its application in a case that I'll come to in a moment that reached this Court from the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.670" offset="3070098">But in this case, he did not dissent from the Algoma rule; he found what he instead was a NEPA exemption to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.820" offset="3098624">That is that under, if the challenges under Environmental Protection Act, the Court has jurisdiction to review notwithstanding the Algoma rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.421" offset="3161004">We believe that that is directly in the teeth of the prior decision of this Court in the earlier case -- earlier hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.065" offset="3203636">Let me remember -- let me refresh your recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.197" offset="3212204">In that case, the lower court the same district judge concluded that although under the Arrow Transportation Company rule, district courts did not have the power to interfere with the exercise of the Commission's suspension order.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.697" offset="3290154">Nonetheless, because this was a NEPA case, they could go ahead and do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.556" offset="3313560">This Court reversed and it said in its opinion that NEPA did not contemplate any wholesale overruling of prior law.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.509" offset="3965367">Let me talk about the Electronic Industries case because I think you don't need to reach really the Algoma rule in this case because I think the Electronic Industries case applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.034" offset="4015522">In the other two cases in Atlantic City and Alabama Power, the challenge was as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has suggested to the whether the Commission was right in its determination that revenue needs warranted the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.751" offset="4078425">That cut across all the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.880" offset="4090859">In Electronic Industries, the challenge was to particular rates on television sets, radio sets, components of those sets just as here the challenge is to recyclable commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.144" offset="4143940">And we submit that the unanimous decision of this Court in Electronic Industries means that certainly you will not permit a challenge to particular commodities in a general revenue order proceeding which is what this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.257" offset="4212381">The Government, I'm happy to say, agrees partially with that but not wholly with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.214" offset="4240280">They agreed that the Electronic Industries case means what I have just said it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.141" offset="4259924">But they don't agree that this is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.204" offset="4272149">They say and I'm quoting from their brief that “the respondents broadly attacked to the Commission's general revenue order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.994" offset="4307362">I don't think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.506" offset="4313422">In fact, I think that did wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.681" offset="4322095">The general revenue order here decided essentially that the railroads need for revenue permitted the Commission to terminate the suspension which has originally ordered prior to the exploration of the suspension date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.279" offset="4388446">That determination isn't challenged by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.018" offset="4403493">They zero in on a few specific rates on a dozen or so recyclable commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.251" offset="4432332">They say that those are the ones that are bad and that seems to me to be just like Electronic Industries and if as I suggest Electronic Industries means that you can't take particular rates and challenge them in a general revenue proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.788" offset="4494503">I think that would dispose of this case but if the Court were to agree with the Government that this is not an Electronic Industries if you're back to Algoma and the problem that divided the Court in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.719" offset="4566288">I would like to take a moment or two to urge as strongly as I can that you do affirm the Algoma doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.452" offset="4601187">The basic point in that doctrine is that nobody is entitled to a rate which is less than just and reasonable and that there can be no resolution of that question, no divinity of resolution of what that question -- the answer to that question except in the Section 13 or Section 15 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.252" offset="4688332">You can't settle it in the general revenue proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.730" offset="4702333">In the Section 13 proceeding, the Commission can and it does take into account all factors that go into the reasonableness of the rate including of course environmental factors allowing a review of it in a general revenue order is really no different than reviewing a suspension order and it really is no different in reviewing any kind of an interlocutory order before there has really been a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.181" offset="4828139">But it's more than that, this would certainly encourage objections to all general revenue orders under our new legislation effective this year, those objections are now going up to District Court but the Court of Appeals but I would venture to say we have an appeal and each of the Eleventh Circuit Courts from every general revenue order by somebody.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.808" offset="4962617">Well, if a new order comes out, if the railroads asked for a new general rate increase, we're going to have objections, we're going to have injunctions the possibility of discriminatory decision -- different decisions and different circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.828" offset="5022699">And any decision that they make as this Court indicated in the previous reversal of the District Court in this case would have an impact -- the premature impact on the administrative procedure that violate what you had said should not be done in the Wichita Green case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.606" offset="5117785">Moreover, it seems to me that because one would expect these attacks and one would expect as we have had in this case injunctions after injunctions which have to be appealed to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.601" offset="5177762">The effect on the railroad's revenues were these orders are based on revenue needs would be substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.725" offset="5214229">The railroads are in need of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.569" offset="5233664">I don't mean that's the reason why the Court should have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.868" offset="5246830">But it does seem to me that that is a fact to be taken under consideration in by this Court in determining whether a rule which has been in effect for 40 years which is part of the framework of this nicely balanced system which is worked out as I say in the statute between the rights of the railroads to propose rates, the rights of the Commission to suspend them, the rights of the shippers and others to protest them, to be protected and get rebates or reimbursement if the rates are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.253" offset="5384338">Whether any change in a 40-year-old system should be made by this Court or if it is to be changed at all should not be made by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.538" offset="5533550">In the time remaining to appellants, I would like to devote my attention to the merits of the case as Mr. Horsky said in our position on the jurisdictional issue is set forth in our reply brief on pages 2 to 4 .</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.236" offset="5580361">The ICC and the United States have not taken any position against or argued against the exercise of jurisdiction by the District Court since appellee is invoked to District Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.312" offset="5628635">I'm sure that they will devote substantial attention to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.597" offset="5645772">The issue on the merits in this case is whether the Interstate Commerce Commission adequately complied with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) as it did the ICC in its final environmental impact statement in this case adequately consider the environmental impact of its actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.019" offset="5739499">In the first opinion that the Court rendered in this case in 1973, the Court remarked that the ICC, the Interstate Commerce Commission, had issued a report in October of 1972, which rather approximately 300 pages in length and gave extensive and I quote the Court “consideration to environmental factors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.994" offset="5823300">The Commission at that time did not issue an environmental impact statement as NEPA requires for a significant federal actions effecting the environment because the Commission believes that the action that they were then taking which was allowing a rate increasing to go into effect would not affect the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.429" offset="5905115">However, as Mr. Horsky has described when the Commission's report was issued, there were number of protest, number of critical comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.470" offset="5941269">As a result, the Commission reopened the proceedings in regard to one particular class of items recyclables and I think its well to define what we mean by recyclables here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.755" offset="5994350">It sounds like a one small group of class of commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.353" offset="6012740">In fact, it's a huge class of commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.182" offset="6024129">On page 13 of the appendix, the Commission drops a footnote and defines what is meant by recyclables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.007" offset="6059447">At least a number of classifications of different commodities, I emphasize the word “classifications.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.456" offset="6673220">So, from -- for the tens of thousands of commodities are moved on the nation's railroads everyday between hundreds of thousands of points of origins and destinations, you have different rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.431" offset="6733093">It is a large group of commodities and for every place, destination, origin there are different rates that are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.197" offset="6768201">The ICC, the Commission in trying to determine what environmental impact a rate increase would have on these recyclable commodities took a very general view.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.637" offset="6853883">And having reopen to proceeding to deal with recyclables and having issue of bibliography that is distributed to all interested parties of 500 different sources setting forth what effect could be expected of the rate increase and contacting by telephone, by mail compiling, analyzing -- the Commission finally issued a 200-page draft impact statement copy of which is reprinted in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.112" offset="6995780">After the Commission issued that draft impact statement, they received comments from various federal agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.677" offset="7134124">For example, went into great detail about the general classes that the Commission decided to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.324" offset="7160665">Let me take steel for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.076" offset="7167666">The Commission has a section -- scrap steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.239" offset="7180309">What effect will a 4.1% or 6% increase on the transportation rate for scrap steel have on the environment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.954" offset="7219179">Consider that, the Commission went through a review of steel making industry at large that reviewed steel making technology, how steel is made, what kind of furnaces are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.890" offset="7258885">It took a look at the steel foundry systems throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.974" offset="7271320">It considered the scrap industries structure, the various different kinds of scrap that are used then for scrap technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.560" offset="7301622">As a result through 200 pages of very, very detailed on clamp analysis, the Commission came to a conclusion and the conclusion was that perhaps this whole impact statement was mistitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.880" offset="7358882">Maybe it should've been called an environmental non-impact statement because the Commission's conclusion was that this rate increase would have no significant effect whatever on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.036" offset="7407470">If the Commission's consideration of environmental factors on October 1972 was extensive as this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.331" offset="7440697">By the spring of 1973, it was tenfold more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.290" offset="7456580">It pervaded this entire proceeding since this impact statement was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.170" offset="7480090">There have been five more general revenue proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.401" offset="7492942">They're coming now at the rate of one every six or seven months as the railroad's revenues declined as cost go up and the railroads need more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.006" offset="7531395">The environmental impact statement issued an Ex parte 295 which came after this proceeding was filed with this Court large with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.688" offset="7570160">Also an environmental impact statement was issued in a general overall investigation of the underlying rate structure of the railroads in this Country Ex parte 270 that was large in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.027" offset="7615509">If one reads the brief filed by SCRAP in this case and particularly the factual statement, one will come away with the conclusion on particularly on pages 10 to 11 of the sort of green color brief that everything the Commission has done since this proceeding, since this impact statement has contradicted itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.539" offset="7721566">Although, it found no significant environmental impact here in later proceedings through using more sophisticated analysis and greater study and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.887" offset="7770885">It came to a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.904" offset="7779035">Nothing could be further from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.192" offset="7788126">On page 10 for example in the SCRAP brief, appellees state rather than having no significant environmental impact is claimed in the Commission's previous boilerplate findings referring to this case that the Commission found in Ex parte 295 that the following would occur with respect to nonferrous metals and then there's a quotation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1965.287" offset="7964505">“However, the quantitative effects of the 3% rate increase will be very small.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.752" offset="7986343">In all case, only a fraction of 1% of the presently recyclable volume of any commodity as a result in environmental impacts in terms of the increase consumption of resources including energy and of pollution are expected to be insignificant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.152" offset="8055933">“Specifically, in regard to nonferrous metals, the decrease in scrap consumption is expected to be two one-hundredths of 1% of the present volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.795" offset="8102536">As a result of which and then the quotation picks up, “an estimated 3,000 tons of metal will be annually required.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.553" offset="8133569">The same is true for the quotation on page 11 what the appellees have set forth as seeming to be a great environmental impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.539" offset="8357491">This is the worst that could be expected at two one-hundredths effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.895" offset="8390928">The District Court held here that the Commission felt to give adequate consideration to the environment and must begin this proceeding allover again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.232" offset="8428335">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.550" offset="8433560">Because the Commission felt that issue and environmental impact statement hardly because the Commission did not comply with the NEPA's five requirements of what the Commission must look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.226" offset="8476296">No, the District Court said that the Commission did comply with NEPA as to form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.774" offset="8498448">Because the ICC's consideration of environmental impact was not extensive could hardly claim that because the Commission's conclusion of no significant effect from the rate increases was mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.601" offset="8553827">Curiously, there's no one in this case yet it says, the Commission was wrong back in 1973 when it issued this impact statement that that 4.1% rate increase would affect the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.403" offset="8605027">Nobody said that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.210" offset="8612237">What the District Court held is that the Commission didn't do enough that it should've study some more that maybe it was right here, maybe it was wrong but it had to “not limit its analysis as it did here” to the “marginal impact of the most recent rate increase” with no discussion whatever of the underlying rate structure itself as that is significantly effects the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.954" offset="8731146">I want to pause at this point and point out to the Court that everything that I have said so far in regard to analysis, you'll notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.993" offset="8759359">And also in regard to what the District Court held has very little to do directly with the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.421" offset="8781093">And the questions that I have talked about you could have a team of the greatest environmental scientist in the world sitting in a room with all the books.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.807" offset="8818604">Because what we're really talking about here is economic forecasting not and only derivatively the environment that is if recyclables do not move on the nation's railroads, then as a result more virgin ore will have to be consumed to produce the final end-product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.546" offset="8885582">But what we're engaged in here and what the Commission was engaged in is really of economic forecasting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.016" offset="9379401">The District Court's critic, we submit of the Commission's environmental impact comes down to simply this that the Commission could have done more.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.409" offset="9573021">The one thing that's clear under Section 157 of the Interstate Commerce Act is that Congress wanted the Commission to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.210" offset="9604263">The question, do the railroads need increase revenue?</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.680" offset="9618056">Not to say, did the railroads need increase revenue way back when which is what the Commission will have to do if they're ordered back to reopen this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.118" offset="9659852">And we submit as well that under NEPA what Congress wanted an agency to do is answer the question, will this action have an effect on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.399" offset="9696946">Not answer the question, did that action have an effect on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.698" offset="9718157">And the reason I say that it's because if the Commission does not act within seven months then the rates go into effect under the Section 157 of the environmental policy or of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.012" offset="9775417">Let me emphasize this again, the Interstate Commerce Commission cannot revise the entire underlying rate structure in a general revenue proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.272" offset="9812511">It can only consider the question whether the increase and rate is justified by the railroad's need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.429" offset="9837066">We submit in that situation the only thing the Commission has to analyze is whether that increase in rate will have an effect and adverse effect on the environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.895" offset="9918986">Now, the Commission did not say that, “Well, we're going to take the underlying rate structures are given to him, we're just going to ignore whether that has an environmental effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.992" offset="9955349">The Commission said that we're studying that in Ex parte 270.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.203" offset="9972172">We've hired a special counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.293" offset="9980531">We have these proceedings going on to consider the entire rate structure the United States is no small test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.698" offset="10002160">This is only second time in the Commission's history that has hired a special counsel and the Court of course knows who the first one was, Mr. Justice Brandeis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.126" offset="10039881">But I just want to say one more thing about the -- this question of looking into the underlying rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.495" offset="10065377">The District Court relied upon comments from other agencies and you have to read the District Court's opinion very carefully in this regard because the Court did not say that the Commission failed to respond to the comments of under -- of other agencies when it issued its impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.718" offset="10134235">On page 31 (a), what the Court said is the Commission did not order its conclusions in response to comments of other agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.859" offset="10174777">While the other agencies for example on page 706 of the appendix, the counsel and environmental quality gave a comment to the Commission when it issued its impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.815" offset="10218663">It said, “We are aware of the difficulties in accomplishing everything that we think you should do in a short time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.137" offset="10247920">And therefore, what we suggest is you postpone any rate increases on recyclables pending completion of Ex parte 270, the separate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.463" offset="10285223">The Commission's response to that suggestion was you're right, we're going to go ahead with Ex parte 270 but we can't postpone increases on recyclables because under 157 of the Act we can only -- we can't say that well, we're not going to allow this increase to go into effect to seven months because we're not sure what effect is going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.245" offset="10364322">Under 157 of the Act, the Commission has to say, “We're going to allow the increase to go into effect unless we have solid evidence that it would be unjust and unreasonable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.896" offset="10406954">Therefore, the Commission had to allow the increase to go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.356" offset="10424822">There are number of other comments that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.101" offset="10439764">I submit that the comments of other agencies here were answered, were responded to if you read through the impact statement it's replete with responses to comments of other agencies and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.642" offset="10493889">I'd like to conclude by just saying one word about the hearing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.319" offset="10508622">The District Court said that when this goes back, the ICC has to conduct in oral hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.868" offset="10530879">NEPA does not require oral hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.544" offset="10541537">157 of the Intestate Commerce Act does not require oral hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.485" offset="10557315">Somehow, the District Court put those two statutes together and came up with the requirement of oral hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.185" offset="10576123">We're not entirely clear why and we don't think that kind of analysis should be affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.818" offset="10598693">Therefore, we ask for reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.218" offset="10632234">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.426" offset="10649057">I respectfully submit that this is a case of which this Court lacks jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.142" offset="10671940">The case is here on direct appeals under 28 U.S. Code, Section 1253 from the grant of a 13-month-old declaratory judgment that the Interstate Commerce Commission was obliged to prepare an adequate environmental impact statement in Ex parte 281, this general revenue proceeding and that it did not in fact do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.045" offset="10771519">Now, if I had to depend for my information on this case on the jurisdictional statements and the briefs of the appellants, I would've thought that this declaration had deprived the appellant Railroads of millions of dollars in loss revenues and paralyze the Commission's ability to conduct general revenue proceedings and that this was why the judgment was appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.422" offset="10885099">But on closer examination that turns out that this simply isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.505" offset="10897429">It was left to us to bring the attention of the Court that the ICC has issued the whole serious of general revenue orders in the last 13 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.393" offset="10936926">Probably, more solved in that in any other year and recent history; this includes one that was served just yesterday which we've lodged to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.256" offset="10980394">And also something that I would never have guessed from reading the appellant's papers was that if we take the rates the actual rail rates that are allowed by the Commission in effect just prior to Ex parte 281 which is this proceeding is being 100 then it turns out that now the rates on primary commodities to find as all those that are not recyclables would be in the neighborhood of 140 and those on recyclables would be in the neighborhood of 120.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.241" offset="11116335">Now, I submit that the judgment from which these appeals were taken is certainly not an injunction and I would also point out that nobody claims that it is rather the claim is that there is unwritten exception to Section 1253 which authorizes direct appeals to this Court not only to the grant -- from the grant to denial of an injunction which is what 1253 requires but also from certain non-injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.794" offset="11246529">And I would point out that the appellants do not rely on any currently effective statutory language for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.055" offset="11279548">What they rely on is ghost language which was deleted from the traditional code 27 years ago in 1948.</text>

            <text syncTime="2809.543" offset="11341511">I was just about to answer Your Honor's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.129" offset="11355930">The answer to that is that if this case had come up under the Urgent Deficiencies Act on the surface of it, it might appear that the Urgent Deficiencies Act would confer jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.896" offset="11398980">But I think that there is some considerable doubt about that on the peculiar circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.791" offset="11430536">The Urgent Deficiencies Act allowed appeals not only from the grant or denial of an injunction but also from the final hearing in any case that was brought to suspend or set aside an ICC order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.040" offset="11491558">Now, I'd like to call the Court's attention very particularly in that context to a case that was cited to us by the railroads and which I regret that we did not pick up in our briefs but I certainly would if the brief were being written today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.392" offset="11548923">That is the case of United States versus Griffin which is in 303 U.S. 226.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.755" offset="11578389">And in Griffin, the Supreme Court in the unanimous opinion or unanimous judgment in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis construed the Urgent Deficiencies Act and held that it's grant of extraordinary jurisdiction, three-judge courts and direct appeals to the Supreme Court was not to be read even as broadly as its literal language on the result of that would be to authorize jurisdiction which had no substantial policy justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.699" offset="11702209">Specifically in Griffin, the issue was that the urgent Deficiencies Act on its phase authorized three-judge court jurisdiction in any suit brought to suspend and set aside and join or no any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.966" offset="11783189">And the court held that the words “any order” do not mean literally any order because there are some orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission which said Mr. Justice Brandeis are manifestly not of such public importance as to require this jurisdiction in the extraordinary procedure of a three-judge court and direct appeals to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.528" offset="11865527">So, on the construction that they quote on the Urgent Deficiencies Act in Griffin, I would say that it's doubtful whether even had that statute been in effect whether a case is highly unusual as this would want direct review by the Supreme Court and a fortiori there is certainly nothing in the Urgent Deficiencies Act which requires the or certainly on the current statutes which requires the Court to give literal construction to a statute which has been dead for 27 years in order to authorize an appeal here which has no substantial policy justification.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.772" offset="12106480">Well, I'm arguing Your Honor that jurisdiction in this Court it seems to me is a matter that's governed by statutes and it's governed by currently existing statutes and the rule for many years has been one of strict construction of jurisdictional statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.253" offset="12164368">And the -- I think a paraphrase of that rule is that if Congress wants to confer extraordinary jurisdiction on this Court for direct appeal but it has to do so specifically in terms and in literal statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.268" offset="12212433">And just last December, the Court had a case, the Gonzales case in which it was held that the 1253 which is the statute under which this purportedly comes up is not to be given its -- the full breadth that its literal language might imply if this leads to undesirable results.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.002" offset="12299368">Well, it's one thing I think for this Court to say something like that but I think quite another to say that Congress when it adopted a revision of the entire judicial code and to one section was put on somewhat different form intended the substantive change.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.755" offset="12438444">But I have looked into this, I've jeopardize Ryder, read the succeeding cases and I have never found the case and none has been cited to us by the appellants in which the Ryder rule was used to create direct appeal jurisdiction in this Court for that was interrogation of the then currently existing statutory language.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.775" offset="12710431">And on the first part, the words “vacate and void” which the Court also used sound certainly as they ought to mean something, but when we look more closely at this we find that they mean almost nothing even potentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.988" offset="12791306">Perhaps, literally nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.152" offset="12799979">We assumed in writing the brief that the lower court was cracked in its characterization of the effect of vacating the Commission's orders when it said that the only effect of vacating the Commission's orders is that the railroads may not rely in certain hypothetical subsequent proceedings on a Commission finding that the proposed rates in 281 were just unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.595" offset="12893706">And we took that at face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.963" offset="12911261">The appellants said nothing which intended to suggest that that was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.999" offset="12927352">I have since been persuaded that the lower courts vacating “of the Commerce Commission's orders” doesn't even have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.578" offset="12973641">And the reason is that the Interstate Commerce Commission specifically declined to make any finding that these rates were just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.222" offset="13008227">And there is also some ambiguity in the Government's brief which we picked up in ours about whether the vacating of the Commission's orders is going to have an effect on the burden of proof in hypothetical subsequent reparation proceeding should any occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.508" offset="13089416">And the way that we picked it up from the Government's brief was that the vacating of the Commission's orders would have the effect of shifting the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.927" offset="13127032">I've since been persuaded that that's not correct either that the burden of proof in a 13 (1) proceeding is always on the complainant and that nothing that happens by way of voiding or vacating the general revenue order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.370" offset="13412812">The word “injunction” as it appears in 1253 has always been subject for this canon of very narrow construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.663" offset="13586056">Here, of course the order is 13 months old, it has never had any practical effect in the railroads so far as I can determine on any rate charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.975" offset="13955323">And I think the reason that that has been blurred is that in those cases there was no practical distinction in all of these in putting Wichita so far as I can recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.193" offset="13988133">There were some direct immediate practical effect from the lower court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.506" offset="14009448">Somebody either could do something, it could not do something, or he was enjoined to do something or -- but it had an effect on what people could do on the real word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.729" offset="14058245">And here, we don't, we've had 13 months and it's had no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.323" offset="14084681">Now, I'd like to pass very briefly to the issue of the lower court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.569" offset="14117700">And on that I'd like to leave my argument principally to the briefs and specifically that some briefs that were not in this case but to the government briefs in the Alabama Power and Atlantic City cases that were before this Court five years ago in which the Commission took a long hard look as they say at the jurisdictional issue of the lower court and came out to a conclusion that is squarely in favor of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.191" offset="14224175">And the Government has reaffirmed that conclusion here saying that the Alabama Power and Atlantic City argument that it made is very applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.697" offset="14270151">The only thing that I'd like to say on that issue in addition to that is that it seems to me that the heart of Horsky's argument is that this suit is really just a backdoor effort to get rate reparations without going through the administrative procedure that is set up for rate preparations a 13 (1) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.822" offset="14366699">That, I would submit is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.662" offset="14382059">Nobody in this case has asserted that he has any absolute right not to pay the rates as raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.135" offset="14407868">What the argument is that if the Commission wants to raise these rates and we concede that its discretion to do so that the Commission has to comply with its statutory procedural mandates and we claim that that is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.080" offset="14463666">And that therefore, we are entitled to have judicial review of our claim that it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.985" offset="14487280">And I would submit that that puts the case on all force to deal with the Heart case that was here four years ago for the plaintiffs in that case did not assert any absolute right not to have a highway built through their park.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.899" offset="14539003">They simply claimed that if the Secretary of Transportation was going to approve such a highway he had to follow the proper procedures and the Court of course held that they were entitled to judicial review of their claim that that did not happen there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.549" offset="14593546">Now, I'd like to move finally to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.879" offset="14610892">The central contention it seems to me on the merits is that it's beyond the power of the lower court or of any court to tell the Interstate Commerce Commission that it is prepared and inadequate environmental impact statement in this general revenue proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.832" offset="14686751">And that that is so even when the clear consensus of comments from sister agencies with environmental expertise which the Interstate Commerce Commission is specifically required by statute to consult and attain the comments from in preparing its environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.663" offset="14758013">From the consensus of these other agencies is this is a sadly deficient statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.160" offset="14780061">In fact, I think we can fairly and conservatively characterize those comments as being scathing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.653" offset="14805974">And I'd like to call the Court's particular attention to something that was filed yesterday by Mr. Merrigan which I just saw yesterday new one for the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3935.081" offset="15843662">Page 39 of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.626" offset="15897893">And there the Interstate Commerce Commission makes the statement that it remains a basic economic fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.890" offset="15922970">This is so maybe 10 or 15 lines down in the second paragraph right after footnote 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.131" offset="15947943">It remains a basic economic fact that not granting a proposed rate increase for recyclables would generate a degree of positive environmental benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.165" offset="15983992">And then if you read down to footnote 5, you find that their expert authority for the effect of rate increases on the environment as the United States Environmental Protection Agency 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.516" offset="16037386">Now, also this proposition that it lies beyond the Court's power to tell the Commission that its impact statement is inadequate would require the Court in this case to disregard the history of the case which is the history of the ICC using the word “insignificant” like a rubber stamp to characterize the environmental impact of raising freight rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.669" offset="16142085">As we point out in our brief, the prior history prior to this impact statement is that the ICC had never prepared an impact statement on any rate regulation activity of its and its device for avoiding this was that it made a boilerplate finding in each of a great number of cases that the proposed action would have no environmental impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.172" offset="16240097">And the lower court found that this was qualified boilerplate, a mere stratagem and words to that effect and that of course is not challenged in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.319" offset="16284609">But the point of this is that the ICC kept using this word “insignificant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.857" offset="16306761">So, we come to the present impact statement and lo and behold we find our very prolix document.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.182" offset="16352110">And after each section, the ICC tells us that the environmental impact of what it proposes to do will be “insignificant” there is that word again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.616" offset="16393801">And it doesn't give any figures to tell what it means by “insignificant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.562" offset="16409579">Now, there's been some criticism of our use of the impact statement and Ex parte 295 but in Ex parte 295, the ICC finally got a round to saying what it meant by “insignificant” and it turns out that what they mean by insignificant is that a 3% rate increase on metal scrap alone not counting any other kind will have the effect of requiring increase consumption of electric power sufficient to supply a residential city of 130,000 people or 43,000 households assuming about 3 persons to a household according to the current census data.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.709" offset="16554193">And it turns out that the fuel cost of generating that electricity alone is going to be an excess of $6 million which is a figure that no one has contested since we've used it in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.426" offset="16601109">It turns out that the capital cost of creating the generating capacity for that is an excessive $39 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.965" offset="16639248">Now, the point of these uncontested figures is that maybe you think that these figures are insignificant maybe you don't but it's a point on which there can be disagreement and there is nothing and I emphasize this, there is nothing in the historical expertise of the ICC which automatically validates its characterization of an insult to the environment or cost as being insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.715" offset="16738200">So we have to know what they mean by insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.307" offset="16752619">Now, it's argued that the 295 and following impact statements merely reaffirmed the Interstate Commerce Commission's findings in Ex parte 281 that the impacts were insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.767" offset="16814477">But the difference is that we knew what in -- that we know what insignificant means now and we didn't know them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.144" offset="16839973">And as I said, you can defer as to whether that word ought to be applied and other agencies have deferred on the last page of the Ex parte 295 impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.582" offset="16881664">The -- I'm afraid there's only one copy, I think with the Court but the Department of Interior quite gently points out that the assumption that have changed of less than 1% metals consumption is insignificant can be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.835" offset="16954702">I think that's a very conservative statement and EPA in this material it's filed at the rear of Mr. Merrigan's brief on page 14 (a) looks at those figures and it looks at the conclusion insignificant and it says that the -- that in Ex parte 295, these are certain scrap commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.650" offset="17037981">The Commission has reached the conclusions contrary to those but its cursory analysis in Ex parte 281.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.251" offset="17068387">Now, in conclusion, I'd like to point to something that has greatly struck me about the briefs in this case that we've gotten from appellants and that's the distance traveled in those briefs between the jurisdictional statements in the original briefs and the reply briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.216" offset="17136201">I thought that the reason of this case was brought to this Court when I read the jurisdictional statements on the opening briefs was that the lower court's judgment was going to require things that were literally impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.435" offset="17189073">Now, in the reply brief, we find that well they are arguing that not only of these things not impossible but the deficiencies have been cured since and these supposedly impossible things have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.124" offset="17243826">We found that argued in the opening briefs that this would bring general revenue proceedings to a screeching halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.404" offset="17269008">We were not told that there have been four or five depending on how you count since that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.798" offset="17290533">We were not told that the rates are going up by 40% on virgin materials and 20% on scrap.</text>

            <text syncTime="4348.667" offset="17498049">And it's saying that when that language literally followed or blindly followed is going to lead to a result which has no policy justification then it will not be followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4432.554" offset="17833566">I appear here today for the National Association of Recycling Industries, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.417" offset="17857076">This industry represents the Trade Association represents all of the processors, collectors, and manufacturers who utilize waste paper, textile waste and nonferrous metal scraps such as copper lead, aluminum and so forth in manufacturing processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.389" offset="17928965">In area of course, it's been a party to the 281 proceedings before the Commission and intervened in the case before the District Court and has participated in all those proceedings since I think before this case was last before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.258" offset="17988420">I want to say from the very outset, Your Honor that -- Your Honors that this case clearly does not involved any complicated abstract environmental issues such as Mr. Randolph seem to try to indicate to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.160" offset="18044008">Indeed, I think that his description of the situation is pretty much the same type of approach the Commission has taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.818" offset="18078595">They really simply can't see the forest for the trees and they haven't tried to see the forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.137" offset="18099911">They've been climbing over tree after tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.845" offset="18110777">There are three statutes that this Court really has to look at when you approach this case to understand what Congress has been trying to get this Commission to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.660" offset="18142020">First, is NEPA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.822" offset="18150693">NEPA says that the very opening Section 4331 (b) that it is the duty of the federal government to use all practicable means consistent with other essential considerations that national policy to enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum attainable recycling of depletable resources, that's statute number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.002" offset="18243375">Statute number two, is the Resource Recovery Act of 1970 wherein Congress directed the Government to study the transportation rate situation and the picture covering recyclable commodities and to correct it where a discriminated against recyclables.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.601" offset="18309726">And then just recently, when Congress had before the Railroad Reorganization Act of 1973 which was dealing with the failing railroads in the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.859" offset="18350791">It again included a Section 603 which directly pointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission and directed the Commission to adopt the appropriate rules to eliminate discrimination against the shipment of recyclable materials in rate structures where such discrimination exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.003" offset="18427382">So, we start this case with an understanding that the Commission has been clearly directed by Congress and this Court has a legal basis to proceed from not a complicated abstract environmental basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.385" offset="18476910">You have a legal basis to proceed from to understand that the Commission is simply is not been doing its job in its area and that's what this is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.460" offset="18513168">Now, the history in this case is that right on through the rendition of its final order in Ex parte 281, the Commission plainly refused to file any impact statement whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.923" offset="18563114">Any impact statement that could be called an impact statement and they approved the increase on recyclable commodities without filing anything under NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.122" offset="18599894">It was only when an injunction was there and then threatened because they would've been clearly beyond the appeal of the law that they then reopened the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.111" offset="18631868">At that point and five months later after they had approved the rates on recyclables already, they issued a draft statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.492" offset="18665305">And seven months later, without holding any hearing whatever, they issued the final statement which is of course before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.667" offset="18698010">Now, Your Honors to understand the real essence of this case, I ask you please to look at pages 6 to 7 of our main brief before this Court which is the green original brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.111" offset="18747852">It sets forth what the real rate picture is and what Congress has been trying to get that with this Commission and what this Commission has been refusing to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="4736.204" offset="19048155">Also, I just want to briefly say Your Honor that when Mr. Randolph, the Solicitor General said that Section under that there are really a big in rates involved in this ex parte proceedings I would ask Your Honors to look at point 3 of our supplemental brief and understand that that makes a Section 13 complaint procedure absolutely no remedy whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.521" offset="19129448">Because that means that the shapeup in a case of this kind must challenge rate after rate after rate and we estimate on the basis of the railroad's own figures that it would take a thousand to 3000 case years to challenge just the rates in the eastern district alone, that's in our supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.965" offset="19207189">In his closing, the Solicitor General stated when Congress passed NEPA it intended to say while this Court what impact will an increase have, not did it have an impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.407" offset="19261001">In this case, we say that this is the -- none of this case that the impact statement was not made until after the Commission had approved the increase and then for the first time look at the impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="5155.875" offset="20726888">Mr. Justice White, I'd like to pick up for the question that you just ended with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.033" offset="20747473">Now, the fact of the matter is in this case, the District Court did not charge the Commission with failing to respond to the comments of other agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.992" offset="20779342">What the District Court said precisely on page 31 (a) of its opinion is that the Commission responded but it failed to order its conclusions, not that it didn't respond, it simply failed to order its conclusions because the fact of the matter is that throughout this entire impact statement the Commission responded again and again and again to the various comments of the federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.008" offset="20883414">For example, EPA, CEQ, Department of Commerce thought the Commission should engaged in a study regarding whether increases or cost justified for each recyclable commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.829" offset="20930644">On page 149 of the appendix, the Commission responded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.463" offset="20945272">It said, that burden with thrust to railroads -- thrust upon a railroads to cost justifying increase rates on each of tens of thousands of commodities between hundred of thousands of points “could ensnare the railroads in a morassic calculations from which they have never be able to instruct themselves.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.903" offset="21018937">GSA said that the ICC should keep transportation of recyclable commodities under continued surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.023" offset="21047463">At page 158 of the appendix, the ICC responded will do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.541" offset="21065540">It's doing so in Ex parte 270.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.424" offset="21077034">The Commerce Commission or the Commerce Department, EPA and CEQ all said, “Examine the present rate structure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.526" offset="21105455">At pages 24 to 58 of the Commission's environmental impact statement, the Commission said, whether the increases and rates over the years have cause the misalignment or discrimination against certain commodities as a matter we're studying in Ex parte 270 at which is on-going investigation of the entire rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.396" offset="21188942">Interior Department suggested that the ICC included table of contents to its impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.649" offset="21214020">You'll see it at appendix page 199, the ICC did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.263" offset="21232410">Interior Department or the CEQ said that the ICC failed to analyze the effect on investment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.017" offset="21263444">The ICC responded to that at page 157 on and on and on, this whole impact statement nocuously enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.158" offset="21291969">The ICC has responded to all these comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.455" offset="21301164">The one curious thing is that the other agencies haven't responded to the ICC's response.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.716" offset="21318196">I don't know where one cuts off to this dialogue back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.772" offset="21334497">But it seems to me as I stated originally that the point that the District Court made and said was the fundamental defect in the ICC's impact statement on page 34 (a) of the decision of the District Court was its failure to discuss the underlying rate structure and CEQ said to the ICC, you ought to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.377" offset="21432926">Now, we understand your time constraints said do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.643" offset="21445987">What you should do is hold down the rates on recyclables and continue investigation as other have proceeding Ex parte 270.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.103" offset="21475767">The ICC said we don't have any power to do that under the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.752" offset="21490395">I take that the ICC have all of these agencies as the expert on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.763" offset="21514428">I would also like in the time remaining to bring to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.433" offset="21529057">There has been a great deal of talk about supplemental brief that was filed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.892" offset="21550895">The supplemental brief was filed by counsel for NARI and it's a green sort of an off-green color.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.851" offset="21590810">And I would direct the Court's attention to pages 14 (a) to 15 (a) of that supplemental brief which is of buff green in color.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.852" offset="21634800">That contains the letter from EPA that was directed to the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.257" offset="21652355">The letters dated I believe February the 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.139" offset="21667924">If you take that letter and compare it to pages 10 to 11 of the SCRA brief, you'll notice something quite peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.393" offset="21712959">Beginning at the bottom of page 10 of the SCRAP brief which is the large green copy and carrying over the page 12 of the SCRAP brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.273" offset="21748485">There's a whole series of quotations that I pointed out originally in my opening argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.123" offset="21767816">We think we're taking completely out of context and distorted what the Commission found in later proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.547" offset="21793520">The exact same quotations appear in exactly the same form in the EPA letter to the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.756" offset="21826435">We think the EPA and I might add that the EPA letter came to the Solicitor General's office one week before the SCRAP brief was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.229" offset="21864260">I don't think I have to say much more about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.574" offset="21877635">The other point is that it's been great to have talked about what significance Ex parte 295 has here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.340" offset="21904697">The SCRAP people tell you that the Commission has now quantified its finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.312" offset="21920580">It's given you numbers but they failed to point out is that just last week Mr. Merrigan filed a suit almost the same as this challenging Ex parte 295, the Commission's later findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.454" offset="21969168">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.491" offset="21973347">Because in Ex parte 295 as in Ex parte 281, as in every general revenue proceeding the Commission's had, it has not been able to examine the underlying rate structure which is supposedly the fundamental defect that the District Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.647" offset="22033951">It would be impossible for the Commission to examine the underlying rate structure in a proceeding which is coming now at the rate of every six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.633" offset="22073866">The District Court said that that was the fundamental deficiency in the Commission's decision failed to examine the underlying rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.617" offset="22109811">I repeat that the point that we want to get across here most emphatically is that in a general revenue proceeding, the Commission cannot order the underlying rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.906" offset="22154951">All it can simply do is look at whether the increases are cost justified, whether the revenues that the railroads are bringing in as opposed to their cost justify an increase.</text>
