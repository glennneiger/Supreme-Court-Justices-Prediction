            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll resume arguments in number 73-2055.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.377" offset="140831">Mr. Caron, you may proceed, you have 17 minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wilfred R. Caron</label>
            <text syncTime="15.077" offset="163715">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.876" offset="174895">At the close of yesterday's argument, I was at the point of discussing briefly the supervisory powers of the commission and its Section 7 (b) enforcement remedy which is so directly involved in this particular case and from that point to discuss the cases which is sited by the respondent in support of his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.752" offset="278340">We have emphasized in the brief the overall supervisory responsibilities of the commission over SIPC.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.802" offset="314598">They're extensive and they are detailed at least 10 specifications at pages 10 to 12 of our brief and I would not burden the Court will a repetition of those items.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.522" offset="365484">I would illustrate one now to indicate the under the swipe the commission does have the power under the statute to disapprove any by law or any rule of regulation which SIPC might adopt and more than that it has the power to compel SIPC to adopt the by law at desire be adopted with the same applies to rules and has the power to require SIPC to repeal or amend any existing by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.551" offset="485543">So, that is one illustration of the pervasive control which the Congress has saw to lodge and properly so in the commission and there are other examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.689" offset="530160">And we find that Section 7 (b) which relates the enforcement of SIPC's statutory responsibilities to the investing public.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.892" offset="570911">We find that provision is part in puzzle of packages of supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.007" offset="595362">It's clear from the remarks of the members of the Congress or at least some of them and we report to some of those that Footnote 30 or page 11 of our brief that they well understood and intended that the commission assume on exclusive basis responsibility the suit was that the purposes of the Act would carried out in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.914" offset="695045">I would point to one just to illustrate one Congressman in these words, “The bill gives to the Securities and Exchange Commission continuing over side and rule making authority over the affairs of the corporation to ensure that the public interest is served.”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.166" offset="779995">In light of the receivers authorities cited in support of an implied right of action, I would focus just for a moment on the extraordinary character of the remedy and enforcement power which the commission has.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.513" offset="845406">Section 7 (b) in the first instance would authorize the commission to substitute its judgment for that of SIPC Board of Directors in the event that disagree and on the basis of that difference of view, authorizes the commission to go the Federal District Court where our principal office is located and commence an action, perhaps describable as in the nature of mandamus or mandatory injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.528" offset="969435">But not quite the one I don't believe and it authorizes the Court after reviewing the positions of SIPC and the commission to determine within some parameters not yet establish that either the commission is correct and that SIPC should be compelled to do something under the Act namely commission liquidation proceeding or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.092" offset="1083747">And if the relief is granted what is happening as I indicated yesterday is the compulsion of a proceeding on an involuntary basis to liquidate a broker dealer with all the impact that has and then the process triggering the release of the funds in SIPC for the purposes of the proceeding and in the event that its on funds should proven adequate either by reason of that case or a combination circumstances triggering a call by way of a barrowing on the US Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.462" offset="1221256">Those are the dimension of the remedy which the commission enjoys by express grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.717" offset="1250200">The receivers position, if I understand correctly, is that by reason of the broad purposes of the 70 Act an equivalent and duplicate remedy for precise in the same purposes should be implied and that's the term I believe should be implied in favor of the customers of a firm which may in their judgment feel that the firm is in certain -- die a circumstances and that SIPC should commence a liquidation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.373" offset="1388857">It brings to bare two principles cases really.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.748" offset="1418324">One on which, we rely and namely the National Railroad Passenger Corporation case driver forged and when the brief is the Amtrak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.476" offset="1457298">On the other hand, the receiver would focus on J.I. case against Borak reported at 377 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.034" offset="1499512">Borak is one of a line of cases, the receiver also site Allen against the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.062" offset="1527620">We in turn supply on that line of cases, Warned that Transportation Co. against United State, Bivens against Six Unknown Named Agents, Texas against and Pacific against Rigsby, Fleishman Distilling and we do that for the purpose of attempting an analysis of what these cases really mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.223" offset="1624273">So far as I can determine, that analysis indicates that they involve a determination of whether a remedy traditionally recognized by the judiciary should be denied a particular litigant who was agreed by the Act of another in violation of the statutory duty, a wrong and a traditional sense of tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.968" offset="1735241">Allen for example, involved a deprivation for a voting right, Bivens the violation of the Fourth Amendment right against search and seizure, Borak, a violation of the proxy requirements of Section 14 (a) of the 34 Act, Fleishman, a violation of the provision to the land of Act which prohibit infringement on trademarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.735" offset="1826356">Rigsby, a violation of federal Safety Appliance Act and wind that a violation by reason of the negligence seeking of a vessel, a violation in the Section 15 who delivers on Harbor Act, so on all these cases and I'm certainly there are others.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.999" offset="1891349">Essentially, what is involved is a wrong in the classic sense of Tort, committed against one in violation of law and the search in the cases has been whether be a constitutional provision as in Bivens or a statutory provision as in the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.294" offset="1980583">The inquiry has been has Congress accept from Bivens has Congress by prescribing particular remedies foreclose available traditional remedies for example, damages, recession, injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.672" offset="2062085">In Bivens, there was -- in my opinion this is because there was a right and no particular remedy prescribed hence on, I think traditional basis, a cause of action for damages forth injury committed and all the other cases I've cited except Fleishman.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.151" offset="2144005">While there were certain remedies of a penal of civil nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.203" offset="2160201">The fact was as this Court found that the prescription of certain remedies was on a sufficient indication of a congressional intent to foreclose existing traditional remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.087" offset="2227702">In Fleishman, because of what this Court describe as the prescription of intricate remedies, it felt that Congress had indeed intended to foreclose the possibility of considering in award for attorneys fees in an action under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.214" offset="2324250">So, that we have this suitable tread of rational; I would refer to some language in Bivens and Wind up for example in Bivens.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.062" offset="2367613">The Court stated historically damages had been regardless of the ordinary remedy for invasion of personal interest and liberty presiding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.514" offset="2405439">And elsewhere it was sudden Bivens the question is merely whether petitioner is entitle to address this injury to a particular remedial mechanism normally available in the Federal Courts and for that proposition siding Borak.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.060" offset="2475656">Wyandotte much the same just does the Court said referring to Borak case and Rigsby case which incidentally I believe is the first case in this Court to hold the existence of a private right of action when the framework of the Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.927" offset="2567084">The Court stated the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Wilfred R. Caron</label>
            <text syncTime="625.183" offset="2604074">There abouts I haven't taken somewhere to maybe earlier a case -- maybe early as matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.529" offset="2629465">But this language I find relevant again refer to Borak and Rigsby the Court in Wyandotte said that, “conclusion was in accordance with the general rule of the Law of Torts and elsewhere stated denial of such remedy to the United States will permit the result extraordinary in our jurisprudence of a wrong to a shifting responsibility for the consequences of his negligence on to a victim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="655.935" offset="2727163">I would submit to the Court of that the analysis of Justice Harlan in this concurring opinion, in Bivens represents a very sound and correct analysis and he said and we quote in our reply brief the notion of implying a remedy therefore has applied to cases like Borak can only refer to a process whereby the federal judiciary exercises the choice among traditionally available judicial remedies according to reasons related to substantive social policy embodied in the act of positive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.859" offset="2870836">There was an article which I've found of interest in preparation which is not cited in our brief that its historical development at 117 Pennsylvania law review page one, which was written in the wake of Bell v. Hood and it does in my opinion a good job of exploring the common law back to the 13th and 14 century England, and reaching the conclusion I believe that remedies recognized which I traditional are really the old form of action or rather two one action on the statute the other trespass on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.467" offset="3033213">And I think that this is really what is going on in the Borak line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.668" offset="3058082">Rigsby itself refers to actions on the statute on holding which common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.297" offset="3088593">We believe that the Amtrak case represent some jurisprudence of course this Court believes.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.534" offset="3121507">It involves the different proposition, a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.708" offset="3138226">It relates to a remedy entrusted to a particular federal agency to exercise supervision and a control over quasi public corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.354" offset="3176782">There are many implications and we believe that congressional choices clear and or to be given deference under accepted principles of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.164" offset="3220041">The test in Amtrak as I read it was that given the exclusive grant of such authority, absent any clear contrary evidence of legislative intent that a private remedy coexist thereby placing supervision of the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.861" offset="3302797">The statute must be deemed as grantly an exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.368" offset="3320874">And we think the principle applies here for certiorari for reasons we indicate in the brief one of which is that the commission by reason of his expertise and working with SIPC under this 33 or 34 Act and the 70 Act is most confident, most aware of situations, Congress repossess trusts in the commission, and we therefore think that guided by the authority in the Amtrak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.801" offset="3446575">But more important, on a common sense of appraisal of the 70 Act and what it attempts to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.172" offset="3488057">The act itself, the legislative history, the effectuation of a plan of congress, the recognition of the difference between the legislative and judicial branches and taking into account all the available Presidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.401" offset="3540929">We do believe that the Court of Appeals committed error and that a right might not be implied in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.468" offset="3573217">On the second point concerning the receivers standing, I would not develop that an oral argument, I think that the concessions in the receivers brief two.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.368" offset="3620864">One, that if he were successful there would no benefit to the state of guarantee bond; And secondly, guarantee bond had no right of action in its own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.751" offset="3658376">I think they make the Chaplin case which will rely upon perfectly applicable in sound -- I was only add that -- we believe that it's for customers to decide whether in a situation where both SIPC and the commission feel the statute should not be applied it for those individual to decide what are their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.158" offset="3751999">We think the receiver has obligations to win a state, his duties to marshal and collect assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.941" offset="3771120">He has other credit to be concern about.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.201" offset="3784182">The chance of victory probably is not that great, we do believe that it is on the customers right if it exist and that's the assumption for the purpose of the second point and that the receiver should be denied standing in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.512" offset="3833396">I'd like to reserve whatever time I have for rebuttal, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="943.908" offset="3878954">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.882" offset="3898911">The two issues upon which says certiorari was granted in this case were briefly first whether or not customers of a member of SIPC have an implied right of action to require SIPC to discharge its obligation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.690" offset="3994102">In spite of the provisions of Section 7 (b) which extend that right to the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.788" offset="4034539">Briefly, the receivers position on the first issue is that it is both necessary and appropriate under the facts of this case to the imply such the right of action, in order for the customers of guided by in Securities Corporation to receive and its benefits from the Act and in order for the stated and designated purpose of the Act to be effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.599" offset="4189811">In that instance, we rely upon the case of J.I. case against Borak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.614" offset="4217814">We also rely upon the doctrine of common law which is quoted in the Rigsby case which has been referred to the effect that in every case where a statute enacts, and this is the pertinent part, “enacts a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.980" offset="4347277">It is our position that in this instance unless the customers through their representative the receiver are accorded some remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.864" offset="4398791">They will not receive any benefits under the Act and the manifest legislative purpose will be frustrated as to the right of the SEC to do this same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.467" offset="4469217">Now, I call attention to the fact that 7 (b) is a part of a Section listing the functions of the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.427" offset="4513102">The legislative history of the Act indicates that the commission have a hand in the drafting and the sponsoring of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.696" offset="4558137">I suggest that that Section was put in there to make certain that the SEC did have the right to take such action if it shows but the Court will note that 7 (b) does not require the SEC to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.185" offset="4648103">If the SEC finds that SIPC has not met its obligations the statute does not say it shall seek an order of the Court but it may seek an order of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.233" offset="6728286">I submit that this is not the ordinary liquidation and that the truth of the matter is that this proceeding was very similar to SIPC liquidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.301" offset="7124616">We adopted a mechanism of the 5% assessment to create a fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.186" offset="7152097">At that time, we didn't have enough money to pay all the net cash balances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.275" offset="7168502">The first American National Bank there Nashville had set offer with $250,000.00 of the funds of this broker-dealer which we convince them what actually trust funds much of which with this net cash balances, so that when we went into this plan of 5%, we didn't now whether we going to get that money back or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.577" offset="7257631">Some people had net cash balances, some had deficits, some had large balances and so on, and are equalize them all we adopted this mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.702" offset="7294203">But it seems to me that having pursued this plan the receiver has an obligation to pursue whatever remedy the customers have under this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.336" offset="8176724">They say, “Oh no, It's too late now you've gone way down the road with the receivership, you returned bonds, you've done this and you've that, too late now we can't come in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.890" offset="8218937">Now, all of that is precisely what is happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.092" offset="8231790">The only difference being that they would not be this confusion about the original notice and the issue as to retroactivity of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.335" offset="8272750">So, that it does seem to me that it is important that customers have some remedy if everything else breaks down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.118" offset="8331891">I can understand that it would certainly make the administration of the Act more difficult if every customer along the line will bring a law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.675" offset="8386121">But in any event, a Court has got to make an adjudication as to whether it is the proper case whether the SIPC goes in or customer or somebody else, the Court has got to decide whether it's a proper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.619" offset="8441814">If the SIPC comes in and it says, “We don't want to liquidate this broker-dealer and now we think we can get somebody to put some money in it or we think we can work out in a merge."</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.904" offset="8482983">Then the Court can exercise its right then to hold offer a receivership and the flexibility of the Act is sufficient for that purpose, so that we don't that the granting to the customers a day in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.582" offset="8557693">When the facts justify will embarrass the administration of the Act and that in this case it's necessary and it could be important in some future case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.839" offset="8618715">Thank you sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.923" offset="8715055">I did say an objective view of the few facts which the pleadings disclose will not support the source of breakdown, some shout outs, and everything else has been disclose to here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.346" offset="8800737">Some formal procedure for hearing or something formal about this when they suggest that they'll force with afford most receiver and as SIPC an opportunity and so forth, if the you prevail?</text>

            <text syncTime="2190.368" offset="8864893">It's difficult for me to answer Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.808" offset="8874611">I had only brief discussion with the commission on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.366" offset="8896867">I really couldn't response to the detail of procedure whatever the special both to that informal and in formal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.192" offset="8920168">I myself have questions to whether or not formal procedures are appropriate in the situation where you have the sort of discretion large in the commission which is intended to be exercise in its supervision over us which I'm afraid that I quite honestly could not be definite on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.506" offset="9005432">I think if we must get into the equities, there is a fair enough indication in the record that part of the problem here was the dormancy of the receiver in communicating with separate for four months after we knew when we existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.002" offset="9075336">The fact that he carried the liquidation through the completion practically and then decided to write a letter and ask for the remainder to pay the fees involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.487" offset="9113370">I think though discussion of this sort is not appropriate for the purpose of the important question of legislative intent and the construction that ought to be brought to bear on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.819" offset="9170631">I simply suggest to the Court that issue were to be answered in such way as to hold the 70 remedy accordance to the commission was meant to be exclusive and that was a proper exercise of congressional judgment.</text>
