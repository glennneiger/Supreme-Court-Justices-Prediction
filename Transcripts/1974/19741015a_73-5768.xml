            <text syncTime="17.541" offset="173537">This case is here on writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and two questions are presented for the Court’s consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.066" offset="215646">First is, may a federal habeas corpus court decline to consider the merits of an issue already presented in a direct appeal to a State Supreme Court merely because the State Supreme Court in a later case has accepted the same position that was earlier urged upon them?</text>
            <text syncTime="45.658" offset="285968">Secondly, may a federal habeas corpus court decline to reach a fully exhausted issue merely because it shares a habeas corpus petition with an unexhausted issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="57.361" offset="332779">We submit that both for these questions should be answered in the negative and that petitioner should have a prompt adjudication of both of his habeas corpus issues by a federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.141" offset="439986">What had happened is in response to the District Court opinion which devolved upon the state the burden of going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.847" offset="478751">The Commonwealth had petitioned the Circuit Court of Fairfax County to initiate a habeas corpus proceeding on petitioner’s behalf at which the presumably the instruction issue would be raised before them and that's how that was said in motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.453" offset="557223">And other counsel were appointed by the Fairfax Court and when I received notice of those proceedings I both moot in the federal court to stay them and also when the federal court refuse to stay those proceedings appeared in the state court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.132" offset="635904">And I think Mr. Chief Justice, you focused on one of the issues that respondent has raised that is why didn’t I just go back into the state court have this issue -- this instruction issue adjudicated and done with.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.438" offset="697135">I would submit that there are numerous reasons for not going back.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.762" offset="718451">First of which, it is not at all clear that although Commonwealth through the Attorney General would be satisfied to have the issue adjudicated by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.470" offset="773204">It’s not at all clear under the state court rule of Hawks versus Cox which is cited in our brief that the state court would even hear the merits of the instruction issue because the instruction issue was raised on direct appeal and the writ of error denied and the Hawks doctrine states that absent change circumstances determination of an issue by a state or federal court is conclusive and there is no indication that the Sharp decision upon which the Commonwealth relies is a change circumstance within the meaning of Hawks doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.027" offset="2207431">I think it’s clear that they relied on their own line of cases and also in this Court’s decision in Leary on the federal issue on whether this is an irrational hence, an unconstitutional presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.738" offset="2290291">I think that this Court has indicated in Roberts v. LaVallee which has been cited in our brief that the mere possibility of successful pursuit of a state remedy that is open is not sufficient to send the petitioner back to exhaust that remedy again when he has exhausted once before.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.260" offset="2364374">This Court’s been fairly clear that repetitious applications to state court are just not required of a habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.731" offset="2398333">He is just required to once give the state courts a fair opportunity to resolve the issue and Mr. Francisco has given the state court in his direct appeal their opportunity to adjudicate the precise question which they later adjudicated in Sharp.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.688" offset="2562173">And the Fourth Circuit by a virtue of their abbreviated procedure in habeas corpus matters did not call for full briefing on this case but merely sent petitioner a letter asking him to informally inform that court what complaint he had of the District Court’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.414" offset="2633017">He in turn forward that letter to me and I responded in somewhat informal fashion in light of the Circuit Court’s request and did not cite any cases in that letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.068" offset="2835623">However, I think if you look at the petition, you'll see that it was verified by the petitioner in September which was prior to the October 3rd decision in Sharp.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.943" offset="2879195">So, it wasn’t a case were the Sharp decision came down he said, there's a great decision let’s run with it in the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.633" offset="3025899">So, at the time the petition was actually sent to the District Court both I and petitioner were unaware of the existence of the Sharp decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.972" offset="3079293">I think also we have to look not only to the instruction issue which was involved in Sharp but we have to look the search and seizure issue which was by everyone’s notion fully and completely exhausted absolutely right for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.811" offset="3162572">And what the Fourth Circuit did and the District Court did not do was to say, well, the District Court is right in sending you back to the state courts to have your instruction issue adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.716" offset="3218265">But what the District Court should have also done is state its hand on a completely independent search and seizure issue and not even reached the merits of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.133" offset="3259956">And accordingly, the Court of Appeals vacated that portion of a District Court opinion which did deal with the search and seizure issue and I would submit that that's wholly inappropriate way of treating a multiple issue habeas corpus petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.202" offset="3440201">There's very little point in saying if we’re going to make a choice on issues and say because we reached one issue, we’re not going to reach another.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.505" offset="3481370">Reaching the instruction issue and not reaching the search and seizure issue seems to be putting the cart before the horse because if you say, let's leave the search and seizure issue ride for awhile, let's allow him to be retried, allow him to have another state appeal wherein that instruction presumably will not be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.562" offset="3553573">And then some two or three years later will be in a position to rule on a search and seizure issue which would have been dispositive in the first instance and would’ve not required any further proceedings in the state court of any character.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel C. Kaufman</label>
            <text syncTime="887.366" offset="3652838">Well, I would first say that I believe as a matter of judicial economy and the fundamental nature of the habeas corpus writ that a court should always pass on all issues presented to it and right for adjudication because they will in many instances control a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.654" offset="3729951">But I think in an individual case, you also have to examine -- make an examination of what else is there beside this particular issue that could come up in a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.629" offset="3769866">Now, if you had a Miranda issue and a search and seizure issue for example and if excluding the confession would not as a practical matter -- preclude a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.338" offset="3824724">Then, I think you want to reach -- and the search and seizure would then I think you want to reach that issue which would as a practical matter preclude a retrial because otherwise you'll wind up with a retrial that may proof fruitless.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.447" offset="3881148">You'll also -- what you also be doing is interfering with the fact-finding process that will ultimately have to be made on a search and seizure issue or Miranda issue or any kind of an issue where we have to go outside of the record or we could go outside of the record to determine the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.964" offset="3947186">What you're doing by permitting a retrial with an issue unresolved is at best you're delaying it and you may impair the fact-finding process when a federal district court is ultimately called upon to decide it.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.456" offset="4001207">But conceivably on a retrial the state court might hold the factual hearing again on the search and seizure thing that might be adequate under the 1966 revisions to Habeas Corpus Act, might that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel C. Kaufman</label>
            <text syncTime="985.729" offset="4046242">It might well be but it might also be that the state court would say that the prior decision on a prior motion to suppress is the law of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.247" offset="4092322">We were simply in a very murky procedural area and what we’re doing is it seems to me going to and snare a petitioner this on procedural murkiness areas and sort of in the hope that the case will go away which is the Fourth Circuit seem to say what might be that this case is going to be moot one day and will never have to rule on this search and seizure issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.273" offset="4188453">And I simply don’t believe that a federal court should speculate as to mootness on this kind of a record where there's simply no reason to believe that Francisco would not be retried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.218" offset="4228263">There's simply no reason to believe that he could not be again convicted by the state at least of the lesser included offense of simple possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.429" offset="4281135">And it’s plain that the search and seizure issue relates altogether with whether they can convict him possessing a controlled substance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.868" offset="4318856">Instruction issue merely goes to whether there is sufficient evidence in state court under proper instructions for the jury who was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.291" offset="4372564">I think this interference with the fact-finding process is the same kind of concern this Court expressed in Barker versus Wingo, the speedy trial case as the reasons for not delaying the trial -- the initial trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.399" offset="4428988">And I think the other aspect of prejudice alluded to by this Court in Barker is that of anxiety is still present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.021" offset="4467440">Petitioner still has no way of knowing what the ultimate outcome of his Fourth Amendment issue is going to be if this Court says that the courts below were right and that we should go back into state court thrash out the instruction issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.126" offset="4531911">If we win have a new trial maybe have him convicted to a more severe sentence to a more time by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.996" offset="4563362">And then he can have his Fourth Amendment issue finally resolved by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.731" offset="4590320">I think if we also adopt the Commonwealth’s position in that regard where you have a multiple issue situation and assuming arguendo that this Court decides the instruction issue has not been appropriately exhausted and that the instruction issue is really properly before this -- the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.370" offset="4660851">I think what you wind up with doing is encouraging petitions for certiorari to this Court because people who were convicted in state court who have, let's say a federal constitutional claim which they have directly raised and have fully adjudicated in direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.572" offset="4741622">Yet, they have other constitutional claims which have not been so adjudicated would be discouraged from seeking intervention of the lower federal courts by habeas corpus petition but it would instead be encourage to petition this Court for review by certiorari on that very issue that was in fact decided by the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.076" offset="4827721">And I think as this Court recognized in Fay assert petition on a direct appeal is an unnecessarily burdensome step in vindication of federal constitutional rights where it can be relied upon that the federal -- the lower federal courts will be in a position to hold hearings if need be or would be in a position to adjudicate these federal constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.205" offset="4940152">If the Court has no further questions, I would reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.223" offset="4988217">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.714" offset="5006190">As Mr. Kaufman has pointed out, there are essentially two issues involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.452" offset="5029177">The first relates to the instructional issue which was based on a Virginia statute at that time that indicated that a conviction of possession of drugs could be based solely upon evidence as to the quantity of that drugs conviction of possession with the intent to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.271" offset="5120502">An instruction based on that statute was given in this case in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.873" offset="5150908">I might point out that the objection that was made at the time of that instruction was and I quote from page 129 of the transcript of trial “we object to instruction ‘G’ Your Honor, we realized that this is merely a quotation from the statutory language.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.807" offset="5234604">However, it is my opinion that this instruction does not in any way guide the jurors and may tend to confuse them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.739" offset="5266369">Now, this is not in the appendix -- this portion from the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.732" offset="5286327">Subsequently, in other words, the objection at that point was on the basis of the possible vagueness of the instruction or on the basis the instruction might tend to confuse the jurors rather than really guide them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.079" offset="5351737">When the petition for appeal was filed in the Supreme Court of Virginia, the nature of the issue had somehow been re-characterized and it was then based on the several federal constitutional issues including the validity of the statute upon which the instruction was based on the basis of vagueness and also on the basis of this Court’s decision in Leary versus United States in that it was an impermissibly unconstitutional presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.754" offset="5490395">So we would submit that even initially there might be some threshold question of exhaustion as to in light of this Court’s decision in Picard versus Connor based on whether the federal constitutional issue was ever precisely presented to the Virginia courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.142" offset="5575973">In other words, the Virginia Supreme Court takes the position that the only issues that will be dealt with be effectively on appeal are issues that were properly and timely raised at the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.816" offset="5882650">Yes sir, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.467" offset="5897279">The petitioner and there's no question about the fact that the issue on search and seizure was properly raised and properly characterized both at the state level and the lower courts and in the Supreme Court of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.709" offset="5958196">A writ of error was denied as to both issues which in the Virginia Supreme Court is considered to be a ruling on the merits -- the order denying a writ of error states that it is denied for the reason that the judgment of the court below is plainly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.755" offset="6030399">The petitioner then filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia and Alexandria raising principally these two issues as Mr. Kaufman has pointed out the Sharp decision intervened before the District Court dealt with this case and the District Court took the position that the intervening decision in Sharp necessitated that the petitioner exhaust his available state court remedies with regard to the instructional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.039" offset="6191522">In that, this intervening decision did present a new state of law and the Virginia courts quite possibly and perhaps probably would feel compelled to grant petitioning a new trial based on the intervening decision in Sharp versus Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.759" offset="6270412">The District Court though did proceed to deal with the search and seizure issue on the merits and rule that the issue did not have any validity that the search and seizure in this case was indeed proper and that the evidence was properly admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.369" offset="6360900">The District Court took the somewhat unusual procedural stands that as to the unexhausted instructional issue -- the burden was on the respondent represented by the Attorney General’s office to present the issue to the state courts in some manner for a re-adjudication of the Sharp issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.233" offset="6456299">The respondent of course objected to this procedure on the basis that the rational of 28 United States Code Section 2254 with regard to its requirement of exhaustion of available state court remedies places that burden of exhausting the state court remedies on the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2790.676" offset="11266069">First, on the objection in state court I would freely conceive that inexperience trial counsel namely me in the heat of a hotly contested trial just overlooked that grounds for objecting to that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.071" offset="11327613">But I point out to the Court that the constitutionality of that instruction was plainly unmistakably raised in the petition for writ of error as demonstrated on the pages 31 and 32 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.038" offset="11395532">The Commonwealth in responding to that petition the abstract there is page 34 of the appendix addressed the merits so that there was no question at that time of any procedural default in raising the constitutionality of that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.974" offset="11463241">And neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals level has the Commonwealth asserted procedural default in raising that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.016" offset="11643486">I would tend to agree that that would certainly be an open question had the Commonwealth in opposing the petition called the Court’s attention to some defect in the objection but they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.033" offset="11691551">They went right to the merits of the instruction itself, there was no question raised at that point as to any procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.078" offset="11731675">And in that regard, I direct the Court’s attention to a recent the reported decision of an en banc panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Harris versus Superior Court which appears of 500 F.2d 1124 where the court there said a state court decision which could have been procedurally founded will not be presumed to be procedurally founded in a habeas corpus case unless the state court in its decision expressly states that it’s declining to reach the issue of the claim on a per procedural matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.839" offset="11890709">Also on, Mr. Shepherd would have send this back to the state courts because there's something different about the way the state court and the state habeas corpus proceeding would handle it than the Federal Court would mention this concept of harmless error and I would suggest the Court that harmless errors always present in any habeas corpus petition whether it be state or federal and it’s present in the direct appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.273" offset="11988511">I don’t see any difference between the kinds of question and the ability of a court to consider the kinds of questions whether it’s a state court or federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.037" offset="12039502">And if there are no further questions from the bench, I would submit.</text>
