            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Three opinions to be announced by Mr. Justice Powell are 73-6848, Bowen against the United States, 74-114, United States against Brignoni-Ponce, and 73-2050, United States against Ortiz.</text>

            <text syncTime="21.159" offset="84532">These three cases come to us on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.798" offset="111177">Each presents a different issue concerning the United States Border Patrol's operations for apprehending aliens to enter the country illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.717" offset="154854">In 1973, we held in Almeida-Sanchez versus the United States, that Border Patrol officers on roving patrol may not search private vehicles without probable cause to believe that they contain aliens who are illegally in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.887" offset="235520">We did not decide in that case whether probable cause would be required for similar searches at established traffic checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.715" offset="278779">In United States against Ortiz, No. 73-2050, respondent's car was searched without probable cause at a Border Patrol checkpoint near San Clemente, California and three aliens were found in his trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.393" offset="353489">The Court of Appeals held this search illegal under the principles of Almeida-Sanchez.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.098" offset="380343">We agree that the ruling of that case cover searches of private vehicles at traffic checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.477" offset="409809">Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.227" offset="424856">Mr. Justice Rehnquist filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.768" offset="439066">The Chief Justice joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.223" offset="464875">Mr. Justice White joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
