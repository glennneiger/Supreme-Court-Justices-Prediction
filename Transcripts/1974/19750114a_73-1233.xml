            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in number 73-1233, National Labor Relations Board against Sears, Roebuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.173" offset="308015">Mr. Friedman, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="54.142" offset="319927">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.596" offset="333720">The question in this case here on the writ certiorari to the Court of the Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is whether the Freedom of Information Act requires the disclosure of certain documents generated by the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board so-called Advice and Appeals Memoranda which relate to the prosecution of unfair labor practices before the Board by the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.743" offset="450330">And order to put the issue in context, I would like at the outset to describe briefly the procedures that are followed within the General Counsel's office in the deciding whether or not to prosecute an unfair labor practice charge before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.330" offset="516681">As this Court is aware, the National Labor Relations Board itself has no authority to bring an unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.378" offset="556910">It can only act in response to a charge that has been filed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.174" offset="580106">If a charge is filed and any person can file a charge, then the General Counsel if he wishes to may prosecute the charge but only in response to someone else bringing a matter to the attention of the Board formally, may the Board issue an unfair labor practice complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.210" offset="668191">Now, the General Counsel of the Board, who is a presidential appointee, serves two functions in connection with the having of cases before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.911" offset="707062">First, he is the one when a complaint has been issued who prosecutes the case before the Board, but secondly he has final authority to determine whether or not a complaint should be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.893" offset="758993">That is, if after examining the case, the General Counsel decides not to issue a complaint that is the end of that case as far as the Board is concerned.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="173.354" stopTime="174.851">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="173.354" offset="796818">And it's wholly unreviewable, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="174.851" stopTime="473.111">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="174.851" offset="802774">Wholly unreviewable held by a number of courts to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.815" offset="818657">Now, the General Counsel in turn has delegated to the Board's Regional Directors of whom there are some 30th, the authority initially took process unfair labor process charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.021" offset="867453">When a charge is filed with one of the Regional Directors he investigates that he ordinarily will interrogate witnesses, look at documents and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.597" offset="905801">And after he has completed his investigation, there are three possible things he may do.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.853" offset="922833">First, he may conclude that there is nothing here that warrants the issuance of a complaint and he decides not to issue a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.893" offset="958986">Secondly, he may conclude on the basis of his investigation that there's enough here to warrant the issuance of a complaint and he issues the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.577" offset="985631">Or third, he may submit the merit to the General Counsel's Office in Washington for advice on whether or not he should issue a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.032" offset="1023457">The General Counsel has put out instructions to the Regional Directors that they are to refer two categories of cases to Washington for advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.374" offset="1064835">One, case that present novel or complex problems or two, cases that involve certain issues which the General Counsel has specified should be submitted to him in Washington in order to assure a uniform prosecutorial policy with respect to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.136" offset="1143933">Now, when the General Counsel receives from the Regional Director a request for advice, the matter submitted to something called the Office of Appeals in the General Counsel's Office where the case is thoroughly and carefully reviewed by a number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.561" offset="1217599">And this review process culminates in something called an “Advice Memorandum”, in which the General Counsel sometimes act himself more frequently acting through the man in charge of the Office of Advice, advices the Regional Director on whether or not he should issue a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.202" offset="1300146">This Advice Memoranda, the General Counsel gives the reasons for his decision, discusses the evidence of the case, analyzes Board precedents and if the advice is that a complaint should issue generally gives the theory upon which he believes the case should proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.861" offset="1378826">Now, although the representative examples that are included in the record of Advice Memoranda contain nothing making any reference to the possibility of settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.939" offset="1431176">The report -- the two reports in this record presented by the Practice and Procedure Committee of the Labor Law Section of the American Bar Association on which Sears relies very heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.708" offset="1482167">And in one of those reports, set forth at page 71 of the appendix, the Committee which represents of course the experts in this field both on the labor and the management side, recognizes that not infrequently, this Advice Memoranda will refer to settlement possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.349" offset="1564818">It's in the middle of page 71 and the statement is, “the response to the region will sometimes include specifics with respect to the kind of settlement or other action and will set forth the theories upon which such cause of action is based.”</text>
            <text syncTime="380.903" offset="1626990">And I stressed that because the ultimate question in the case is what these things are.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.891" offset="1646947">Are they just a statement of legal position or do they involve something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.243" offset="1676309">They basically reflect to the strategy, the litigation strategy of the General Counsel has recommended be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.291" offset="1708492">And we think the fact that they refer to settlement negotiations and suggest a basis upon settlement, to us is very clear evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.593" offset="1741720">Now, if the Regional Director should decide not to issue a complaint either because of the advice he has received from the General Counsel or because his own investigation indicates that a complaint is not appropriate, then the charging party has the right to appeal that determination to the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.078" offset="1827715">The matter is then similarly reviewed except by different office by something called the Office of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.043" offset="1855509">If the Office of Appeals upholds the Regional Director's determination, it so advises him and the parties that there are rather brief statement giving the reasons for his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.222" offset="1900231">If however, the Regional Counsel is reversed and the General Counsel concludes that a complaint should issue, they then prepare something called an Appeals Memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.176" offset="1944116">And the Appeals Memoranda is similar to the Advice Memoranda and that it too describes the case suggest theories, gives the reasoning of the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.794" offset="1990510">Now, it's these two categories --</text>

            <text syncTime="504.749" offset="2122376">And I'd like to just make one other point of here, because the claim is that somehow, these Appeals Memoranda represent the law of the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.688" offset="2162082">They are not the law of the General Counsel, the General Counsel makes no law, all he does is applies the law as the Board and courts have developed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.769" offset="3466428">Let me just come back if I may if one more thing to talk -- describe a little bit about these Appeals Memoranda and the Advice Memoranda here.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.562" offset="3513657">All that they really decide, all that the General Counsel is deciding when he either recommends in the Advice Memorandum when he authorizes a complaint or in the -- at the Appeals Stage and the Appeals Memorandum when he tells them to go ahead and file it, is that this is a matter that ones presentation to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.121" offset="3591816">He is not deciding that there is a violation and that is shown rather explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.546" offset="3621595">In this record, there are at least three examples in the Advice and Appeals Memoranda and also in two letters sent to counsel for charging parties in which it explicitly stated that, this is a matter that warrants passing on by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.747" offset="3694320">Let me just refer the Court to two of these and then I'll cite the others at page 191 as Advice -- an Advice Memorandum which ends up that authorization of complaint was warranted to place the issues of the case before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.663" offset="3758059">And then at page 206, which is an Appeal Memorandum in the second full paragraph under reasons for actions it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.987" offset="3791287">“Issues were raised with respect to various issues which warranted Board determination on the basis of record testimony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="930.777" offset="3826500">Another example of that is at page 211 of the record and then at page 32 and 199 of the record, letters sent by the General Counsel to counsel for the charging parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.353" offset="3884805">Now, let me come to the facts of this case very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.682" offset="3898075">In this case, Sears filed -- Sears, Roebuck the respondent filed with the Regional Director a charge against a union alleging that the union had refused to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.509" offset="3949380">That alleged refusal of the bargain whether there was a refusal to bargain turned upon whether Sears had properly withdrawn from a multi-employer unit prior to the time that bargaining began.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.885" offset="4010924">This is a matter of some dispute within the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.807" offset="4022627">There's a lot of Board precedents on this, a lot of litigation on this as to just when an employer or a union may withdraw from multi-unit bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.035" offset="4063483">The Regional Director referred this case to the General Counsel for advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.730" offset="4090337">The next thing that we know by the record is that the Regional Director advised Sears that he was not filing a complaint on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.592" offset="4141746">Sears then appealed this to the General Counsel and the General Counsel reversed and advised Sears that a complaint would be filed stating and as again, coming back to what I said a minute ago that this case raised issues warranting Board determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.409" offset="4213008">That's at page 32 of the appendix and then the Board, the Regional Director subsequently issued a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.839" offset="4242683">Now, prior to the time that Sears appealed from the Regional Director's refusal to issue a complaint to the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.714" offset="4286255">It requested the General Counsel to furnish it under the Freedom of Information Act with three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.302" offset="4312586">First, the Advice Memorandum that the General Counsel had submitted to the Regional Director advising it not to issue a complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.679" offset="4358040">Secondly, all Advice and Appeals Memoranda relating to the same subject that is the timeliness of employer withdrawal from multi-employer bargaining units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.555" offset="4401612">All of those Appeals and Advice Memoranda rendered within the past five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.531" offset="4425540">And third, an index or a digest to the Advice and Appeals Memoranda, what it stated was it needed this information in order to successfully prosecute its appeal to the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.681" offset="4486144">The General Counsel refused to furnish these memoranda under the Freedom of Information Act relying on exemptions 5 and 7 of the Act which is that I will discuss shortly, and also saying that these memos were not a final disposition of the case but were merely guides to the Regional Directors on how to prosecute the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.465" offset="4573184">Sears then filed this action in the District of Columbia District Court to obtain this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.771" offset="4602441">While the case was pending before the District Court, the General Counsel of the Labor Board announced that as a matter of discretion and not because it was required by the Freedom of Information Act, that he was going to make available to the public copies of all of the Appeals and Advice Memoranda in so-called close cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.112" offset="4695855">That is cases where the Board proceeding had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.042" offset="4711528">He stated that he was doing this in order to provide the public and the Labor Board with further information as to how this office was functioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.661" offset="4749981">Both sides in this case moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.819" offset="4762624">The District Court granted Sears motion and entered a rather broad order set forth at pages 9 to 10 of the record which directed the Board's General Counsel to provide all Advice and Appeals Memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.298" offset="4820616">Sears had broadened its claim in its complaint so we were directed to produce all Advice and Appeals Memoranda for the past five years including anything incorporated by reference and those things, that is if for example as we read the order, if the order directed them to produce an Appeals Memorandum and the Appeals Memorandum said for reasons stated in the Regional Director's Memorandum, we conclude we will not -- it was not to authorize complaint in this case, that would have to be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.018" offset="4943496">They also -- it also said that where it used some vague language such as in the circumstances of this case, the General Counsel have to explicate that and explain exactly what was meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.204" offset="4988217">Now, let me say that this kind of thing in the circumstances of this case as set forth and the reasons given in the Appeals Memoranda or the advices of the -- the request for advice from the Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.108" offset="5035760">This is just some kind of shorthanded phrases within in the informal administrative procedure that is followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.156" offset="5060002">What is done in this situation is the parties the General Counsel is dealing with the people in the Regional Director's Office and the region they are familiar with these things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.958" offset="5491231">The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed on the basis of the decision of the District Court and also cited its opinion in the Grumman case, which is another freedom of information case to be argued immediately after this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.553" offset="5561553">Now in the Freedom of Information Act, what Congress has done is to provide three different categories of information that are subject to production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.014" offset="5599378">First is one category which has to be published in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.018" offset="5615470">Then there's another category consisting of three components which has to be produced and indexed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.784" offset="5642533">Finally, there is a third category of identifiable records which just have to be produced. But then the Act goes on in subsection (b) and list nine specific categories to which it says the Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.534" offset="5701465">Our submission to this Court is that three of those exemptions cover this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.431" offset="5729050">And if we are right in that, if we are right on any one of those, if any one of those exemptions covers this material, that of course is the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.198" offset="5756113">You never have to reach the argument upon which Sears relies so heavily that these documents are comprehended within the three subcategories which are required to be published and indexed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.222" offset="5804283">And so I will addressed primarily and perhaps exclusively depending how the time runs the reasons why we think the exemptions cover this and we have discussed the other issues fully in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.683" offset="5858095">Our principal reliance and our reliance in the lower court was on exemption number 5 which was before this Court two terms ago in the Mink case which provides for interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.617" offset="5949837">There's no question that these are intra-agency memoranda.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.026" offset="6895470">And we also think finally that these are not administrative instructions to staff because the legislative history shows that administrative instructions -- that administrative instructions was put in there that specific modifying word was put in there to make it clear that this dealt with administrative matters and not instructions relating to law enforcement or litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.158" offset="7008005">Let me just come to what the Court said in Mink about exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.996" offset="7027336">What the Court said in Mink in exemption 5 was that, “their Congress incorporated the special and subtle rule that confidential intra-agency advisory opinions are not privileged from inspection and that the question in each case is whether production of the contested documents would be injurious to the consultative functions of Government that the privilege of nondisclosure protects.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.248" offset="7124407">It also said that, “Congress in this exemption was intended to permit discovery of purely factual matters appearing in Government documents that could be separated out from the nonfactual.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.940" offset="7167143">Now, we think that these documents, we think of the essence of Government consultative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.805" offset="7190549">This is the way within the General Counsel's Office advice is set out to the field on whether to prosecutor case, how to prosecute a case, what theory is to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.719" offset="7234226">The documents -- these are not documents in which you can separate out the factual from the nonfactual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.306" offset="7260557">They are intertwined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.145" offset="7263901">They are inextricably intertwined because of theory of the case is tied with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.684" offset="7282082">Indeed, when the people in the General Counsel's Office marshaled the facts, explained the facts, that itself is the essence of a lawyer's job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.816" offset="7314683">He looks at the facts, decides how to present the facts in a way that will be most effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.612" offset="7337775">It's really either is or is certainly analogous to the lawyers work product which traditionally is not available in discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.648" offset="7385945">And indeed, I think it's very revealing at page 131 of the record in this case, that Sears itself apparently recognized that these documents are being sought for something more than just information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.541" offset="7441533">They wanted them as they've said in order to help prepare to litigate this case, first to take the appeal and then to litigate it before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.254" offset="7472358">At page 131, a letter in which Sears requested the General Counsel to extend the time for its hearings stated, “that we need this material to prepare witnesses prior to the Board hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.931" offset="7535052">Well, any lawyer would be delighted if he could have access to the material in his opponent's files showing how his opponent was going to try the case, what its strategy was, how he feel the evidence, how we would marshal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.494" offset="7585311">That we submit is precisely the kind of information that Congress intended to protect against disclosure in exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.184" offset="7848103">But perhaps, I ought first to give the Court just a basic outline of what our position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.863" offset="7866807">And that is, it is our position as opposed to the position of the Solicitor General that if the documents in question fall within 2 (a) (b) or (c) of the Freedom and are required to be disclosed as either final opinions in adjudication statements of policy or administrative instructions affecting staff?</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.244" offset="7952384">Then, you never reach the exemptions because they are -- the exemptions in so far as the kinds of documents involved here are mutually exclusive for the reason that Your Honor, if in fact, these are declarations of substantive law and obviously, I have to develop that whole point, and if this is an agency which has been conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.809" offset="8026572">And these are the declarations of this agency then it would be contrary to the very basic principles of the Freedom of Information Act to permit an agency simply by passing documents back and forth to create the very kind of secret law which the Freedom of Information Act was designed to avoid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2012.510" offset="8153422">I must confess to begin that in terms of the specifics of all of the various agencies that might or might not be affected by a decision here, I cannot speak for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.941" offset="8187173">But I can answer it in this fashion, that the record does reflect what types of documents are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.875" offset="8214862">And the kinds of documents which you admitted, the documents -- the procedure that we follow here was before the Mink case that we agreed upon representative samples of the kinds of documents after 12 weeks of going through the documents in the General Counsel's Office and the Advice Memos when in fact documents that he gave us and the Appeals Memos were documents that we found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.544" offset="8289573">These very documents however, do not deal with the kinds of information that Mr. Friedman speaks of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.717" offset="8318203">Perhaps, except in rare occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.621" offset="8325831">They do not speak of trial tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.239" offset="8332309">They do not speak of settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.772" offset="8338474">They do not -- they do one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.047" offset="8347564">They informed the public or the parties as this presently the case as to what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.395" offset="8372955">Now, I would submit and ask you a question Your Honor, if the Justice Department as a prosecutorial agency were to inform people as to what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.286" offset="8404511">In other words, only the basis of their proceeding, not the how, not the witnesses, not how they are going to try the case, that's what's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.527" offset="8441501">And maybe, that in the nature of Justice Department, other agency proceedings, the instructions or the trial tactics or the names of witnesses, or the facts may be so intertwined that for that reason, those agencies documents may not have to be produced and may fall under one of the exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.814" offset="8510673">But in this case, where the documents are pure and pristine, questions of law and where the district court judge quite correctly and affirmed by the Court of Appeals struck and said that settlements, discussions, names of witnesses or anything else that's exempt can be eliminated from the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.149" offset="8575979">And they can in the nature of this documents then I submit that we don't have a problem in terms of the very kinds of fears that Mr. Friedman quite properly sets forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.346" offset="10784789">And then there is the Appeals Memorandum which is essentially the document in the chambers brief in the Bonner case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2691.988" offset="10871306">The Fifth Circuit was critical of the General Counsel for not acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.024" offset="10895444">Now, he has it within his prerogative and unreviewable discretion whether to proceed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.633" offset="10909863">But the fact remains that until this memorandum was published and this General Counsel in his grace had decided to make it available to the bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.132" offset="10963884">And in this instance, he of course gave it to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.647" offset="10973915">Now, in an advice situation, the Advice Memorandum is every good as final Your Honor as the Appeals Memorandum if the party chooses not to appeal because that it the law whether or not the party chooses to appeal, in the underlying Sears case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.569" offset="11025638">For example, we presented all argument I did myself to the Office of the General Counsel, and it was because of that oral and the first time around it was no avail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.090" offset="11063777">The Advice Memorandum was against us and we never did see exactly what was in that we have seen it recently because the case is now closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.054" offset="11095542">But we never did see the Advice Memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.896" offset="11102960">As a result when we filed the appeal, we were arguing in the dark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.177" offset="11116126">Now, the General Counsel attempted to give us some more information as this process went forward in this case again as a matter of grace and I think the appendix reflects the letter of the Regional Director which is exhibit page 21 where the Regional Director after we made the demand for the Advice Memorandum the first time, indicating that we're proceeding with respect to the Freedom Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.447" offset="11233155">The first paragraph of that letter states, “This letter sets forth with greater particularity my reason for refusing to issue complaint in the above caption case, and is sent pursuant to the teletype of July 21, 1971 from acting General Counsel Goslee to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.742" offset="11290311">I think that's very significant that letter for number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.995" offset="11303372">First of all, it shows that the Director is an essence a minister -- acting in a ministerial capacity and Judge Corcoran below quite correctly made that finding based on the facts of these case and these facts are not unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.076" offset="11359692">The records include the operations of the General Counsel which is his statement to the House Committee in 1961 which continue to be so and includes the lengthy ABA reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.747" offset="11402324">I think also this underlying case, and again this page 21 of the appendix points out the fact that the General Counsel on three occasions changed his theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.914" offset="11435029">Now, he is permitted to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.172" offset="11440044">We ultimately won because he issued a complaint in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.352" offset="11452792">But in no time did we really know what his theory was the first time, had it no time then we really know what his theory finally was when he was going to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.392" offset="11480900">So, it was very difficult to act and it certainly would be very difficult for the other side if they were in disagreement with the basis of his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.168" offset="11516008">And yet, if we had chosen not to file the appeal or party chooses not to appeal, that is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.552" offset="11541608">It's final not only as to that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.263" offset="11548400">But moreover, it's final because the law of the advice, that is the law of General Counsel if its not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.661" offset="11574000">And it's interesting to note that while parties are informed of an appeals decision, parties are not informed when the matter goes to advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.326" offset="11604720">Now, I think sophisticated practitioners before the Board know to ask the right questions and if they do ask they tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.308" offset="11628648">But you might not ever know when you get a letter from a Regional Director that it was pursuant to an advice determination unless these advice determinations are made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.236" offset="11664280">Now, I also -- in terms of how the procedure works while we're on the procedure, I would call the Court's attention to appendix, the appendix attached to the respondent's brief in the case here and particularly 3 (a) the second paragraph in that appendix --</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.912" offset="11779009">It says in the second paragraph, secondly, the Advice Branch does not ordinarily review the Regional Director's factual determination and conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.584" offset="11813700">It does not interfere with the investigatory duties of the Regional Director.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.537" offset="11849540">And going on, Your Honors to page 4, the top of the following page, there are four consultative functions that take place and I talked about advice but it's been ceded that the judge found and this Operations Memorandum, it's been ceded that the appeals function essentially the same way except that's on appeal rather than on advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.849" offset="11918817">And there are four steps before this final decision is rendered by the General Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.853" offset="11934804">Step one on page 4 (a), the reviewing attorney researched his all cases in point and ascertains the applicability of prior advice determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.324" offset="11972629">And I should add that while the General Counsel in the quarterly report in which is published at page 150 of the regular appendix, in one of the cases specifically cites to a prior quarterly report to a prior decision in a prior quarterly report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.418" offset="12105017">I can't find it this moment, Your Honor but it is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.939" offset="12119124">The second thing that happens in this procedure is having reviewed the case, it is then submitted for further consideration to an advice agenda and then it goes on to explain all the people that are at the agenda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.885" offset="12162905">And this is essentially a conference where the legal issues are better drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.284" offset="12180459">Then it goes on to say depending upon the complexity of the case, cases may be submitted to the agenda orally or by written memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.835" offset="12206686">I should add at the time of this agenda takes place, the oral argument of counsel would have been presented not face to face but separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.849" offset="12234794">The legal positions of the region were presented and the submission of the parties to the case would have been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.562" offset="12261648">Then the agenda decision, there's a decision rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.424" offset="12273037">The decision is submitted to the General Counsel and then finally the second paragraph on 4 (a), the General Counsel's final determination is communicated to the Regional Office by a way of memorandum from advice and that's a memorandum we're talking about and the record reflects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.556" offset="12329566">There is no instance nor instance in this record where Regional Directors ever not followed that advice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3092.402" offset="12473031">First of all, it was essentially conceded that this is a stipulated record and it was there -- it was the Government's burden and there is no instance in this record where they produce any evidence to show that it was not followed -- into the advice decision was not followed and moreover, the General Counsel has conceded in his brief on page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.889" offset="12566967">And it was also conceded earlier in the open court that rarely, if ever, does a Regional Director disregard an advice decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.818" offset="12594657">And I think if you think of the nature of this whole process, the General Counsel indicates it requires, I don't want to spend all the time going through it, but the words are that it's required that certain things be submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.851" offset="12638751">And there are instructions that return from Washington, it is for the purpose of the General Counsel administering his 41 regions so that a uniform --</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.996" offset="12739375">It's first of all I think it's been conceded as a separated agency and an agency under the APA not just under the Freedom Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.204" offset="12768214">And interestingly of course, that Mr. Friedman tries to suggest perhaps there might be some difference in the definition of adjudication of the Freedom of Information Act but of course it's all one Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.540" offset="12805517">The APA is a part of the Freedom of Information Act and the APA defines adjudication to mean agency process in the formulation of an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.836" offset="12838745">And an order to mean in whole or in part, any part of the final disposition of an agency, I'm turning to Your Honors' decision with respect to the ITT case at page 15 of the slip opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.656" offset="12885974">Your Honors state, when Congress define order in terms of a final disposition, it required that final disposition to have some determinate consequence for the part to the proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.149" offset="13367986">And the General Counsel in his quarterly report at page 150 of the appendix specifically publishes that adopted policy and he states at the opening -- at the opening of that report in my judgment, this publication produces a better informed labor bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.304" offset="13432560">Now, presumably he thought publication would help not to interfere with law enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.183" offset="13492120">I think that is certainly one of the critical policy questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.884" offset="13922931">A good part of it just the General Counsel's interpretation of the Board's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.555" offset="13941635">I mean, presumably, a series has its own legal department they can interpret the Board's decision, can't they.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.932" offset="13963055">Certainly, we can but there are no Board decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.208" offset="13972250">That's really the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.274" offset="13976430">The last decision of the Board here was probably 10 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.741" offset="13994297">Well, take a look at the thing on page 83 through 85.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.544" offset="14045497">But Your Honor, the point is this is how he interprets them and he will decide to proceed or not to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.963" offset="14063261">In this particular case, he decided not to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.538" offset="14073501">As a matter of fact, until our case came along, the General Counsel just refused to proceed on re-litigating the issue of what constitutes withdrawal from multi-employer bargaining on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.063" offset="14107669">And there was nothing you could do to get him to proceed in that fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.264" offset="14232430">I think the test Your Honor is that there's no question this is the law of this agency, that's how he proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.599" offset="14257716">And I think the test has been said by the Hawk's Court, the Sixth Circuit as to whether or not it will promote or impede law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.408" offset="14281017">And there's nothing in these documents that in our view, will impede the enforcement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.468" offset="14297213">In fact, the General Counsel himself believes they promote the enforcement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.121" offset="14315813">Now, let me turn very briefly if I may to the exemptions and why we're not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.660" offset="14333994">I have already said that the exemptions are mutually exclusive because if in these final substantive opinions of an agency then for the agency simply if able to pass them between itself intra-agency would create the very body of secret law which is not desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.151" offset="14407973">And Mr. Justice Bazelon of the DC Circuit in the Sterling Case which is cited in our brief essentially drew the distinction between formulations of policy and substantive declarations as to whether the exemption deployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.666" offset="14458023">And we submit these are clearly substantive declarations of policy rather than the formulation of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.689" offset="14478085">The formulation is what I described in going through the Advice and Appeals Memoranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.821" offset="14494699">So far as b (7) is concerned, the Congress recently amended b (7) of the Act to specifically take out what's an issue here because they indicated and I'm reading from the new amendments of the Freedom Information Act b (7) investigatory records are exempt but only to the extent such records would interfere with law enforcement proceedings which is again the as the Hawk's test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.545" offset="14589576">And more importantly, in the Conference Report on page 12 describing that language the Congress says, “nor is this exemption intended to include records falling within the scope of subsection 52 (a) (2) which is (a) (b) (c) which is the very thing that we're talking about here.”</text>
