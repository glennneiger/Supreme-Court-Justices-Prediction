            <text syncTime="38.740" offset="258382">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.657" offset="278026">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review the judgment of that court, reversing the Environmental Protection Agency's approval of a implementation plans submitted by the State of Georgia pursuant to the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.102" offset="359737">The case is before the Court of Appeals on a petition for review, direct review pursuant to that Act filed by Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.605" offset="417834">The Court of Appeals set aside the approval on several grounds, only one of which is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.645" offset="445942">That ruling concerns the substantive standards and the procedural requirements governing EPA's consideration of a variance from a requirement of a state implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.310" offset="508635">The Court of Appeals accepted NRDC's argument that all variances regardless of circumstances must be treated as involving postponements plan requirements, and therefore subject to the provisions of Section 110 (f) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.977" offset="587316">EPA disagrees and has from the outset, construed the Act as authorizing it to approve variances in at least some circumstances without reference to Section 110 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="133.927" offset="639039">EPA's position has been upheld by the other four Court of Appeals to consider the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.359" offset="664848">You're going to tell us what those circumstances are?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_p_norton" startTime="142.802" stopTime="364.408">
            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="142.802" offset="674565">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.441" offset="681148">The -- both the circumstances and the distinctions, the differences that follow from these two approaches because they are substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.527" offset="721481">The case arises under the 1970 Amendments to the Act which substantially revert the Act and established a very wide-ranging, complex, and innovative program to try to deal with air pollution, and imposed on newly graded EPA in the states a variety of new duties to be satisfied within a fairly unusual system of statutory deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.234" offset="832345">Before discussing the particular facts concerning the Georgia plan, I think it would be useful if I review the statutory provisions involved here and with some care.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.956" offset="875186">The case is principally concerned with the program under the Act to try to deal, control and reduced air pollution resulting from emissions from existing stationary sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.185" offset="924087">I'm not dealing with motor vehicles or other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.933" offset="947075">Section 109 of the Act required that EPA promulgate what are called national air quality standards for certain pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.381" offset="992946">The so-called primary standards under the Act which are the ones of pertinence today where to be set by EPA at a level requisite to protect the public health within adequate margin of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.095" offset="1051773">I'll refer to these as the national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.594" offset="1065775">These standards had to be issued by EPA after rulemaking proceedings within 120 days from enactment of the Act in December 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.513" offset="1109452">They're subject to judicial review and are also subject to revision by EPA, but the same time, Section 107 of the Act required EPA within 90 days of enactment to consult with the states and to designate air quality control regions covering the entire country.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.986" offset="1183326">This could be either entirely within the state or they could cross state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.882" offset="1206941">But the states also have important obligations and responsibilities under the Act consistent with the findings of Congress that it was a primary responsibility of state and local governments to deal with air pollution at its source.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.734" offset="1266291">Section 107 provides that each state shall have the primary responsibility for assuring air quality within the state by submitting an implementation plan which would show how that state would attain and maintain the national standards within each region, air quality region in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.316" offset="1352600">More specifically, Section 110 (a) requires that each state within nine months of EPA's promulgation of a national standard hold public hearings, adopt and submit to EPA such an implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.695" offset="1422190">Under Section 110 (a), EPA is required to approve that plan within four months upon determining that it satisfies a test set forth in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.363" offset="1472867">One is of principal interest here, and that is that the plan must provide for the attainment of national standards as expeditiously as possible, but in no case later than three years from EPA's approval of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.862" offset="1538800">We refer to this as the attainment date.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.891" offset="1554892">Attainment date, the date of attainment --</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="367.240" offset="1572342">The plan is also to include emission limitations, compliance schedules and other measures necessary to attain and thereafter maintain national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.285" offset="1620511">Congress anticipated that one approach of state could take in its plan was to include emission limitations which would be effective at or near the attainment date, which would give the sources affected a lead time within which to try to comply with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.616" offset="1693863">Now as the effective date neared, if it seemed that a source might still not be able to comply, a remedy was provided under Section 110 (f), one of the provisions involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.294" offset="1744541">That Section provides that prior to the date that a source of emissions is required to comply with any requirement of a plan, the Governor of the state can submit to EPA a request for a postponement of the applicability of that requirement to that source for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.318" offset="1816639">EPA is required to approve such a request if it makes four determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.724" offset="1842239">First, that good faith efforts had been made to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.537" offset="1857494">Second, that the inability to do so was because the necessary technology or methods were unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.162" offset="1884035">Third, that interim measures had been taken to reduce the impact of the source on public health. And fourth, that the continued operation of the source is essential to national security or to public health and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.796" offset="1942549">Such a determination by EPA --</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="480.898" offset="2026977">That is for postponement and it subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.377" offset="2048920">Now, Congress recognized that the available knowledge of air pollution problems and the resources of state and the federal agencies in 1970 were not necessarily equal to the task, of striking the most refined balanced in the formulation of these plans, accordingly, provided for research, training and funding programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.457" offset="2129168">In addition, lest these initial hastily reached judgments or possibly misjudgments be immutably cast and steel, the Act also provides for revision of the state plans in Section 110 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="521.798" offset="2190608">A revision could be approved by EPA only if the state is held the public hearing on it, and if the revision like the original plan itself complies with the requirements of Section 110 (a) for plans, most significantly, the revision like the plan must provide for attainment of national standards within the three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.611" offset="2285798">If it does so, EPA must approve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.575" offset="2301680">Upon approval by EPA, the state plan becomes the applicable plan for the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.723" offset="2334281">Requirements of the plan are then enforceable not only by the states, but also by EPA and through citizen suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.972" offset="2367300">Now without a revision of the plan or a postponement, a source that does not comply with the requirement of a plan once it becomes effective would be subject to an enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.476" offset="2417246">Now to assist the states in this ambitious and cooperative federal state venture, EPA promulgated detailed guidelines for the states to use in formulating their plans, covering both technical and procedural matters set forth in 40 CFR Part 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.238" offset="2496345">Now, EPA recognized that many states were not prepared at that point to engage in the sophisticated tailoring of the requirements of their plans to the variety of situations presented in the various regions within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.797" offset="2554546">Therefore, the states where initially permitted to develop emission limitations and other requirements more like a butcher than a surgeon if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.061" offset="2595610">For example, a state could determine what was needed to bring the worst source in a region into compliance or to permit attainment of national standards in view of that source.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.108" offset="2659767">And then to generalize those requirements and apply them to all sources within that region or to other regions, such approaches, and this is not the only one, built in to plans a degree of overkill in that many sources would be required to comply with the requirements which were not necessary to attainment of national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.101" offset="2763734">Now if a national standard were not being met in a region in 1972, the practicability of attainment within the three-year period or sooner might well be governed by the ability to reduce or control emissions from a single source or a limited number of sources, power plant or a steel mill or smelter refinery, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.495" offset="2861328">In a period of up to the full three years might be required in order to develop a necessary technology, acquire the equipment, install it and so forth, obtain regulatory approvals.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.846" offset="2922768">If such sources could not attain or could not comply and attain national standards prior to the three-year period, then that became the attainment date for those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.498" offset="2977416">This is mid-1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.223" offset="2992253">There's also provision for extension of those dates in some circumstances, but they're not presently of great moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.488" offset="3025272">Now where attainment prior to 1975 was not feasible for these reasons, a state still had some choice as to when to make the requirements of its plan generally effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.429" offset="3081070">It could make them effective near the attainment date or sooner or perhaps immediately, as it might well be feasible for many sources to comply in a shorter period of time, even though such compliance was not necessary in order to attain national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.492" offset="3145331">There's no dispute that the Act permits and indeed encourages these efforts which go beyond the minimum requirements to attain standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.895" offset="3186918">Now, EPA anticipated that there would be inevitably a need for some provision for variances, exemptions, or deferrals, either because the state adopted plan requirements that were effective too soon or overly strict or unrealistically ambitious or for other reasons or because of problems that were simply not anticipated in 1970, 1971, and 1972 when the plans were developed, the energy crisis, the unavailability of equipment and the capital problems of various companies being good examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.028" offset="3343444">Therefore, EPA concluded that where a variance would not interfere with the timely attainment or the maintenance of national standards, it need not be subject to the postponement procedures of 110 (f), and instead could be treated as a revision of a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.283" offset="3432469">EPA included this interpretation in its proposed guidelines which published and after receiving comments by NRDC and hundreds of others, none of which criticize this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.115" offset="3483878">EPA included this interpretation its final guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.986" offset="3503313">Now, while EPA was considering the plans submitted by that states on the basis of these guidelines, NRDC even agreed in congressional hearings that this interpretation was correct as we have noted at page 31 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.358" offset="3572799">Having no reason to question its interpretation, EPA went ahead and approve plans containing variance procedures which did not necessarily require resort to the postponement procedures, and this --</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="993.239" offset="4076335">Well, I'll get to that, there was a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.245" offset="4104338">By the time NRDC changed its position however, the EPA's interpretation had been relied on by the states in developing their plans by EPA and approving them, and by the various sources in determining whether to challenge the state plans or to seek variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.660" offset="4174033">With this background, I'll turn to the specific facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.084" offset="4187721">In April 1971, EPA promulgated national standards for some six pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.622" offset="4213844">Georgia submitted its implementation plan in January 1972, having developed to the intervening nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.468" offset="4245295">In Georgia like all but five states, there was at least one air quality region in which the national standards for one or more of the pollutants was not being met as of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.220" offset="4312273">And like all but three of the states were at least some of the standards where not being met in some region, Georgia concluded that it was not practicable to attain those national standards until the end of the three-year period, mid-1975 should note that since EPA has approved those attainment dates, we must accept here, the fact that it was simply not practicable to attain national standards any sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.118" offset="4439855">Now, like the majority of states, Georgia made many of its initial limitations effective immediately or much sooner than the actual attainment date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.649" offset="4477994">It either gave no lead time or a limited lead time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.972" offset="4499310">As a result, compliance problems where inevitable and Georgia adopted the variance statute which is an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.583" offset="4529716">EPA approved the Georgia plan, including the variance statute in mid-1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.057" offset="4559600">Now as I mentioned, Section 110 (a) contemplated that the plans submitted by the states would include compliance schedules which would be adopted to assure that sources which in 1972 were not in compliance with the requirements needed for attainment of national standards would be by the attainment date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.605" offset="4649775">This is whether or not the requirements were immediately effective or not, and they could either cover categories of sources or individual sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.896" offset="4690944">If they had been submitted as part of the original plans, they would have been subject to approval without reference to 110 (f), and subject to the standards of Section 110 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.798" offset="4738591">However, because of the enormous demands imposed upon must states by the task of preparing the implementation plan, Georgia like most states, simply was unable to complete the work of developing compliance schedules completely and submitting to EPA with its plan a full array of such schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.463" offset="4841200">As a result, after the state submitted their plans and indeed after EPA had approved them, they continued working on the development of compliance schedules and submitted them to EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.946" offset="4895117">They submitted them as revisions of the plans that had already been approved, not as postponement request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.726" offset="4922284">There are some 800 of these in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.934" offset="4931062">They're total of 3,000 in the states in the Fifth Circuit, and many more in the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.964" offset="4959274">Many of these variance request compliance schedules have already been approved by EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.618" offset="4989889">I should note, there's no reason to believe that this process has resulted in any abuse or undermining of the purpose of the Act because they would not be approved unless they would not interfere with timely attainment of national standards in many or limited periods of time which have already elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.461" offset="5073168">So in practical effect, the basic question here is whether such schedules and variances could only be approved by EPA in accordance with the procedures of Section 110 (f), or whether EPA properly construed its Act as permitting it to treat them as plan revisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.171" offset="5152057">That's important to emphasize in view of NRDC's claims that the case does not involved merely attempts to extend the deadlines of previously negotiated compliance schedules, but possible rare exceptions, these variances and compliance schedules are the initial submissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.583" offset="5225723">They are not kind of going around for a second bite of the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.320" offset="5248606">NRDC claims and the Court of Appeals held that the only procedure available for EPA's consideration of these belatedly submitted compliance schedules and variances is the postponement procedure of Section 110 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.093" offset="5311718">They would apparently require compliance with 110 (f), even if the variance would not interfere with timely obtainment of national standards, and even if the problems calling for the compliance are result of mechanical breakdowns or tornados or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.616" offset="5385801">Now, they assume that 110 (f) is always an available alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.017" offset="5407431">But as I noted earlier, by its terms, its available only prior to the time that a source is required to comply with the requirement of a state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.364" offset="5448808">In the states that imposed immediately effective requirements, without a revision of those requirements, 110 (f) would not appear to be available at all, even if compliance was unreasonable, unnecessary, or severe hardship would require closing the plant down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.252" offset="5536371">Now, the Fifth Circuit's position has been decisively rejected by the other Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.866" offset="5562807">In the cases we've cited in our brief, the First Circuit followed by the Eighth and the Second held that 110 (f) is the exclusive procedure for considering variances only in the period subsequent to attainment of national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.538" offset="5621530">And even then, the First Circuit held that limited variances could be granted without reference to 110 (f) to account for mechanical breakdowns, acts of God and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.763" offset="5666461">Now as for the pre-attainment period of principal concern here, these courts held that compliance with 110 (f) was not necessary, unless a variance would interfere with timely attainment of national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.176" offset="5736051">Of course, only rarely in the pre-attainment period would a variance threaten national standards because it's going to run out before the deadline comes, and since air -- even if a source work producing emission above the standards, once its stop in compliance, the air disperses and value compliance state, it would be at national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.823" offset="5850676">Now, these courts found such authority for variances without reference to 110 (f) implicit in the very structure of the Act, and the essential need of flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.820" offset="5890696">Having had its authority sustained as to the most important period, the pre-attainment period, EPA did not seek review by this Court of the limited adverse aspects of those rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.847" offset="5942732">Then in September 1974, EPA revised its regulations to accord with the First Circuit ruling, so as to disapprove all state plans insofar as they authorize variances, including Georgia's and post-attainment period beyond the limited range permitted by the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.572" offset="6033638">Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit held that EPA could approve what it called minor variances, those which would not interfere with timely attainment or maintenance of national standards at any time, even after the attainment date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.442" offset="6093093">Now without reference to Section 110 (f), they found this authority necessarily implicit in the Act, and like the First Circuit but unlike the first, so no reason for curtailing that essential flexibility of the attainment date.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.913" offset="6990973">Now, EPA's interpretation is consistent with the legislative history limited though it is as we've indicated in our brief that interpretation was brought the Congress' attention, explicitly without any sign of disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.427" offset="7049070">It's in accord with the premise of the Act that states have substantial responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.393" offset="7072893">As we've indicated in our reply brief, it will not threaten public health as EPA's suggest, and I believe it's a classic interpretation of specialized agency's reasonable interpretation of its own statute in an effort to make its pieces work and set the programs in motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.145" offset="7159933">It's entitled to the traditional and great deference particularly where it's been so heavily relied upon.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard E. Ayres</label>
            <text syncTime="1783.289" offset="7236524">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.359" offset="7244779">My name is Richard Ayres and I represent the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.587" offset="7261706">This case involves the interpretation of the language of the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, a statute which was passed to expand markedly the Government's program to control air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.532" offset="7305488">The question presented is whether the Act requires individual sources of pollution who seek more time to comply with the requirements of state plans, to seek a federal postponement, and when if ever, they may approach state governments for state law variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.168" offset="7372048">In other words, the question is when does the federal procedure preempt the state law procedures?</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.696" offset="7398170">We believe the statutes clear on its face the federal preemption occurs as of the time certain and the time certain is the date that the state plans where approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.049" offset="7443519">EPA on the other hand has argued that preemption occurs or has triggered only by its own judgment that there would be a violation of air quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.784" offset="7486464">Now, I think it's important at the outset to understand why petitioners or respondents before the Court here object to the EPA proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.216" offset="7540276">What EPA proposes to do whenever a source comes forward asking for additional time to meet a compliance schedule is to go through an entire analysis of the impact of that source on the air quality, that is the air generally at ground level, as it would be affected by that variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.588" offset="7629720">In practice, the way this is done is by feeding data concerning the given source into a computer model which is a very complex set of assumptions essentially mathematical form about what will happen here under certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.700" offset="7694190">Cracking this through the model, and then coming to a prediction on the basis of the model of what the impact would be on air quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.333" offset="7728671">In most cases, it's just that, a prediction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.288" offset="7740479">Now, that prediction is subject to a great deal of error as you might imagine and EPA had said as we've indicated in our brief that it may be subject to error of as much as a 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.779" offset="7786454">At the same time, it also means that there is fruitful ground for objection to any conclusion EPA draws on the part of any source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.778" offset="7830444">The source may come forward with its own data from monitors and say the prediction was wrong or it may come forward and say it's the wrong model or the wrong factor was put into it, whatever these possibilities are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.948" offset="7883212">There's a fruitful opportunity there for dispute over whether or not the air quality standards would be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.035" offset="7919470">The second reason why this approach seems to us is one that should not and was not chosen by Congress is because it violates the fundamental scheme of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.988" offset="7991359">The Act is built on the premise that the state plan begins with an evaluation of air quality throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.151" offset="8019989">State does that on an aggregate basis on the basis of monitors throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.446" offset="8041200">Second stage is that the state then determines how much reduction is necessary in the emissions; that is the pollution coming out the stacks, in order to meet those air quality standards, again, a general judgment for the state as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.721" offset="8098252">It then applies to each individual polluter, a formula to require reductions and emissions from that individual, and essentially as you can see, the ideas to spread the burden of reducing pollution across sources all over the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.365" offset="8164812">Now, if you go about looking at each individual polluters affect on air quality when it comes into request a variance, you are then reexamining these general decisions, but on the individual basis, and the result will be if you hand out a lot of variances, you will end up with a very unequal burden being placed on the polluters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.980" offset="8283303">Those who have not received variances will be left with complying and they don't have to pay the cost to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.322" offset="8312665">Those who received variances because they've been able to convince EPA that they won't violate ambient air quality standards will be left with no requirement to reduce emissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.717" offset="8354252">The result we think would be fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.007" offset="8367417">Now, that -- these I think are the reasons why Congress chose in the first place to require any individual change, any change in an individual compliance schedule or any other requirement of the state plan, with respect to an individual source to go through the postponement procedure and not to be judge on the basis of its effect on air quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.619" offset="8461876">That was too iffy a judgment and it was too unfair to go about it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.822" offset="8482670">I think we shown in our brief that the language of the statute is totally an unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.205" offset="8512240">It states that any source that seeks a change in any requirement that applies to it must go through the postponement procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.105" offset="8559783">In fact, the importance of this -- of going through this procedure, the importance of the strictness in the procedure is demonstrated over and over in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.941" offset="8611088">As you may notice in reading in the appendix, Congress originally consider requiring sources to go to a federal District Court to obtain this kind of postponement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.858" offset="8662810">Ultimately, they left to an administrative adjudicative hearing as in the final Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.528" offset="8693530">But this does reemphasize the importance in Congress mind of this procedure as a way to prevent easy escape from the requirements of state plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.489" offset="8737311">Now, EPA has put forth an alternative interpretation, which is that somehow through the revision authority of the law, it has the authority to allow states to grant variances rather than having sources go through this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.013" offset="8803453">We've canvassed this issue rather thoroughly in our brief, but I think can be summed up in a rather simply way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.399" offset="8832920">Revisions clearly are and I think it's clear on the statute, something which is set up to allow general changes in the state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.276" offset="8872521">If a state for example should determine that it had required stiffer requirements, then, it really needs to meet the ambient air quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.770" offset="8914422">It would be free to go to EPA in a general way and ask for general change in its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.672" offset="8942111">But the burdens of that change would have to be distributed equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.652" offset="8957994">It can't go to EPA and ask for individual changes, which would unequally distribute the burdens of meeting the national ambient air quality standards</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.590" offset="8997700">The primary purpose of the revision authority, I think it's clear in the statute, was to allow for situations where changes had been made or could be made that will allow for earlier compliance rather than later compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.506" offset="9053393">But in any case, the revision authority is something which is to be used to make general changes in the state plan, not changes applicable to a specific sources; the distinction we think is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.714" offset="9106265">Now, this distinction has also been agreed to by five Court of Appeals; they reviewed the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.670" offset="9142000">All five of those courts who appeal rejected EPA's claim that it had authority under the revision authority to allow specific sources of pollution to have more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.874" offset="9190902">Four of those five Courts of Appeals agreed with us that the trigger after which the postponement procedure became applicable was a date certain, not a judgment about air quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.615" offset="9249834">The Fifth Circuit chose what we think is the correct interpretation that the dates certain was the date of approval of the state plan, which of course was in 1972 in those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.194" offset="9444185">Well, four others have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.397" offset="9456933">The three courts, the First, Second and Eighth Circuits agreed with us as to the concept, that is it's a date certain that triggers the postponement procedure, not an air quality judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.939" offset="9503117">But they chose to set that date as the date of the attainment date specified in the state plan for meeting air quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.914" offset="9539062">This is confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.801" offset="9542614">I think the crucial figure to notice is that it's the date set for attainment, it's not a question of whether an individual source will affect attainment; that's the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.951" offset="9595173">The other three courts said, it's a date certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.988" offset="9607293">It's a date certain that the state chose to attain the national standard, which in most cases is mid-1975, although there are some cases where later dates were chosen through another procedure which is not at issue before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.994" offset="9687333">I think it's important also to look at the suggestion EPA has made that strict construction of 110 (f) as it's written would be burdensome because I think that's a false argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.093" offset="9751698">110 (f) does not always require a hearing, 110 (f) requires an opportunity for hearing, requires that there'd be findings in a adjudicative proceeding, and that those findings relate to the availability of technology, the uses of available alternative measures in order to reduce the effects of the continued pollution during the interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.868" offset="9858800">And the judgment about whether the source is sufficiently valuable so that it's continued pollution at those levels is cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.874" offset="9902895">EPA has in effect admitted that this is not a terribly burdensome procedure by promulgating the September 26 Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.450" offset="9937168">Those regulations required that in the post-attainment period, the only means for attaining more -- for obtaining more time is through the federal postponement procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.382" offset="9976874">And obviously, if that procedure was burdensome as the agency has made out before this Court, it would not been willing to publish those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.855" offset="10018774">In fact, the scheme that EPA proposes, the revision authority is more burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.789" offset="10038523">It involves the states making an original judgment upon the requested variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.311" offset="10064645">A judgment which includes additional factors besides the once that are included under 110 (f) such as the question of the effect on air quality which is a difficult inexpensive determination to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.908" offset="10123055">These proposed variances then go to EPA, which goes over the same set of information, comes to another judgment on air quality as well as other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.884" offset="10162866">And if it disagrees with the state and decides that the air quality impact would result in a violation of ambient air quality standards, since the proposed variance back to the state where the state begins at that point through the postponement procedure, this in our view is a recipe for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.318" offset="10240606">It's much more burdensome than the 110 (f) procedure, which is a single procedure with a smaller number of issues to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.336" offset="10280730">In our view basically, the difference between the two schemes with respect to burden is that the revision procedure suggested by EPA shift some of the burden to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.786" offset="10334542">That maybe an EPA's bureaucratic self-interest, but it's not necessarily in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.138" offset="10367875">And finally, I think it's important to realize that EPA's statements about the burden of this 110 (f) procedure ignore the whole purpose of the 110 (f) procedure of making it a stringent procedure, which was to discourage sources from seeking additional time rather than compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.180" offset="10440077">And if the 110 (f) procedure works as it was intended, there will be fewer requests than there will be if the -- if you use the revision procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.617" offset="10473827">In that case, the burden on the agency will of anything be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.425" offset="10505070">I think it's important to realize that EPA has brought this case before the court because essentially when error that was made in 1972 by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.208" offset="10544253">When the states first adopted their plans, EPA consented to a confusion in some state laws between what a compliance schedule was and what a variance was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.480" offset="10593259">Compliance schedule being a schedule set at the time emission limitations where adopted, which gave the source time to comply with those emission limitations, as oppose to a variance which adds more time on the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.683" offset="10650102">As a result, EPA now has several thousand in the Fifth Circuit state law variances which are in effect compliance schedules under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.866" offset="10710810">Now, this obviously creates a burden if you continue to operate on the premise that this will continue to be dealt with these variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.541" offset="10749576">In our view, we have no interest or desire in forcing the agency to go back through a whole process which amounts to essentially changing the name of what was called the state variance and calling it something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.952" offset="10811225">The court stayed the order of the Fifth Circuit knowing at that time that it would result in EPA's approving several thousand variances in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.863" offset="10850826">Those variances are approved and --</text>

            <text syncTime="3667.496" offset="14773373">Very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.275" offset="14776508">If I may respond just to the standing question first as been raised, I think the statutory problems here demonstrate why the agency's interpretation should be entitled to great deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.100" offset="14827813">The Act is not a really cohesive piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.653" offset="14842023">There are different wordings in the different standing or judicial review provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.153" offset="14863966">I don't know whether the briefs in the lower courts include all of the cases that had been decided on this question but we'll see what they do say in submit something appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.783" offset="14914539">EPA's position, as I understand it comes down to the proposition that if a state failed by one day to submit a compliance schedule as part of its implementation plan, it would be completely out of the picture his concept of federal preemption would totally take over and it be nothing left for the state to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.964" offset="14991235">We don't see the Act is reading that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.217" offset="15000221">It would stand the principle of cooperative federalism on its head to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.397" offset="15020910">On the question of the efficacy of the analysis of the effect of a particular source on air quality in a region, first, that comes up only in the post-detainment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.167" offset="15076080">A pre-attainment variance is not going to have any effect on the attainment of various standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.273" offset="15100426">As to the post-attainment period, we've indicated in our reply brief at page 4 that the other side is failing to distinguish between analyzing the effect of an existing source and analyzing and predicting the effect of a future source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.686" offset="15170121">And finally on the question, the suggestion that somehow the case is no longer alive because of what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.926" offset="15211081">First of all, we don't know the consequences of the Fifth Circuit's ruling on variances which were granted pursuant to EPA's longstanding interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.026" offset="15247444">I don't suggest the Court has to resolve those issues, but it does present a live issue for the sources in the state's in question, and notices of citizens who's had been filed in at least some suits states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.446" offset="15297181">In addition, some attainment dates extent as late as 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.026" offset="15319437">Thirdly, the cycle that we've gone through here of pre-attainment period and attainment date can be repeated because the statute provides for the possibility of the promulgation of new national air quality standards when EPA determines that there are additional pollutants that need this treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.830" offset="15402715">In addition, they can revise the existing standards which would again set in motion the same cycle. And then finally, the decision as to the pre-attainment period does have a bearing on what the law is for the post-attainment period as I've indicated.</text>
