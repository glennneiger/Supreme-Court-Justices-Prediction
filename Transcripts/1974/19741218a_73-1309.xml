            <text syncTime="49.661" offset="303083">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.919" offset="316040">This case is here on appeal from the Virginia Supreme Court following a remand from this Court after the decisions here in Doe v. Bolton and Roe v. Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.801" offset="359612">The question, the principal issue that the Court has to decide in broad terms is whether the First Amendment which extends a special and explicit protection to the press allows a newspaper editor to be held criminally responsible for publishing in his newspaper an advertisement for lawful abortion services.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.482" offset="450309">The facts are straightforward and were submitted by agreement on stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.419" offset="490120">The appellant, Mr. Bigelow is -- was the director and managing editor and responsible officer of a newspaper called the Virginia Weekly.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.422" offset="526064">Would it make any difference Mr. Wulf to your decision you have asserted in your briefs if that were explicitly an ad which solicited, actively solicited -- you say this is just an announcement of service, but suppose they solicited and fixed prices and set credit terms can be arranged in an extensive treatment that usually associated with solicitation of business?</text>

            <text syncTime="157.279" offset="733477">This was not an advertisement by the physician that was performing the abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.067" offset="752703">This was an advertisement by an independent institution organization which referred patients who came to them for the medical services.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="176.804" offset="811635">It surely is.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.691" offset="819158">No, I don't say at all that the state cannot regulate profession conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.567" offset="838698">I say -- that was your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.196" offset="849147">I say that this was not that, one; two that it can't do it in this case because they can't act against the press in this situation; and three, they can't do it in this case because the service was that was to be performed as outside the territorial power of the state, because the advertisement was for and the service to be performed in New York where Virginia has no power over medical services, and it was lawful in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.612" offset="966802">As I say, the facts consisted in this case of the advertisement, which on page 4 of our brief, which announces that abortions are legal in New York, that there are no residency requirements there, that the agency will provide placement service “at low cost”, and provides New York address and two New York phone numbers where the services can -- where the information about the services can be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.805" offset="1099609">Defendant, the appellant went to trial on those facts and was convicted under Section 18.21-63 of the Code of Virginia which is also on pages 4 and 5 of our brief, which states that “If any person, by publication, lecture, advertisement, or by the sale or circulation of any publication, or in any other manner, encourage or prompt the procuring of abortion or miscarriage, he shall be guilty of misdemeanor” was convicted fined $500.00, $350.00 and that was suspended on a condition that he'd not violate the statute again.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.402" offset="1230012">The Virginia Supreme Court in its decision held that the ad satisfied the terms of the statute, because it amounted to the encouraging or prompting of the procurement of an abortion and that it was not merely informational, then went on to say that in petition it was a commercial advertisement offering services for fee relying on Valentine v. Chrestensen and the Fourth Circuit's decision on Hunter versus United States very generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.463" offset="1354250">And went further and in particular siad that where the regulation of medical health practices are concerned, the public should be free of commercial practices and pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.411" offset="1414019">And also finally held that appellant had no standing through his -- the overbreadth argument because appellant's conduct was in the commercial zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.892" offset="1455919">I shall address myself to the first two issues my co-counsel Mr. Lowe will address the overbreadth argument on his portion of this argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.911" offset="1712024">You got to get at least one of them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melvin_l_wulf" startTime="403.433" stopTime="831.904">
            <label>Mr. Melvin L. Wulf</label>
            <text syncTime="403.433" offset="1718084">Well, what I do with Pittsburgh Press is to try to persuade at least one of the members of that majority but this is not commercial speech that's involved in my case, and I will deal with that because I think it's pretty clearly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.796" offset="1779628">Before getting to the commercial speech, question though, this statute -- the first argument is that the statute has to be struck down on its face and as construed in this case by the Virginia Supreme Court, because it, it does not bend any of those categories of speech which this Court has held are prohibitable nor does it require the -- nor in this case was there any clear and present danger that any evil which the state might prohibit would in fact be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.877" offset="1967919">We also argue that as far as the Virginia Supreme Court's medical health interests, asserted interests goes that insofar as that invites the application of balancing test here, that in the balance, the appellant must prevail, and we also argue that the statute is overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.555" offset="2046600">But arching over all of those arguments which I make is the fact that the appellant here was a newspaper editor convicted solely because of a -- words printed in his publication, his newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.265" offset="2109503">And the specific protection extended to the press by the First Amendment and the construction application of the free press provision by this Court at least since Grosjean and on through Mills, New York Times v. Sullivan, Pentagon Papers case, Tornillo, requires that the conviction in this case be reversed and that the appellant not be allowed to be convicted of a crime merely for printing material in his newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.841" offset="2243772">And indeed even Pittsburgh Press assured us that the First Amendment protections of the free press would not go so far as to allow the appellant here to be convicted, because Pittsburgh Press, the majority opinion, distinguished between the material involved there and the advertisements -- and advertisements which expressed position on matters of social policy and also distinguished between the situation regarding the classified ads and the Pittsburgh Press case and the exercise -- distinguishing it from the exercise of editorial judgmental discretion in the content of advertisements.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.857" offset="2379818">And the Pittsburgh Press majority indeed promised, and I quote “that we reaffirm unequivocally the protection afforded to editorial judgment and to the free expression of use on these and other issues however controversial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="584.587" offset="2442721">This speech cannot be banned because it does not fall into any of the standard categories which this Court has allowed to be prohibited namely obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.448" offset="2478143">It's not obscene, it's not libelous nor does the advertisement constitute fighting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.499" offset="2502384">Nor does it present assuming that the state may prohibit this prohibit abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.050" offset="2548569">This statute does not require that advertisements for abortions satisfy the clear and present danger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.215" offset="2593290">In effect, it's clear that the mere advertisement allows ample time and in Mr. Justice Brandeis' words for a full discussion of the question whether the woman citizen of Virginia will in fact undergo the abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.018" offset="2676464">But that rests -- but that argue -- even that argument rests on the duties assumption that the State of Virginia has any power at all to prohibit Virginia residents from being informed of the availability of lawful abortions outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.011" offset="2744487">There is a District Court -- three-judge District Court case in Georgia, the Atlanta Cooperative News case cited on our brief which the facts struck down what is the federal equivalent of the Virginia statute in 1972 are precisely on the grounds which I advance here in our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.871" offset="2823899">And another District Court case in Michigan that supports the application of the clear and present danger test to abortion advertisements, in that case it was a ban on billboard advertisements of lawful abortions, abortions lawful in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.330" offset="2885757">As far as the regulations of the medical health field interest of the state is concerned it has no merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.685" offset="2927135">The Virginia Supreme Court put forward the reason describing its interest in terms of assuring the pregnant citizens of Virginia received proper medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.325" offset="2981679">But that, in this case, although generally of course, a fair interest of the state where medical care is concerned, doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.930" offset="3020131">First, the First Amendment is involved in this case on behalf of the appellant who was an editor of a newspaper, and for the reasons I have already briefly canvassed that is one of the other ingredients that has to go onto the balance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.910" offset="3076033">There is the correlative First Amendment right of readers of the newspapers to receive the information about the availability of lawful abortions in New York honest and on a subject which concerns the right that held by this Court to be fundamental to choose whether the right that women have to choose whether or not to bear a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.178" offset="3169134">There is an addition in the balance the constitutionally protected right to travel across state borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.950" offset="3188151">There is the constitutionally protected right to privacy which I have alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.570" offset="3202675">And there is finally, the absence of power in the State of Virginia at all to regulate the contrary in any state -- the absence of power in any state to regulate the conduct of its citizens out of state in ways that have no contact with Virginia at all except the fortuitous fact of residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.111" offset="3276863">And I think in fact that the last reason is virtually dispositive of this case, because it seems to me unarguable that the states cannot forbid its citizens from engaging in acts which are lawful outside the state, and if it cannot forbid that then it cannot forbid it advertising of those activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.478" offset="3362335">Didn't I correctly understand you to concede that the State of Virginia or any state could forbid members of the medical profession from advertising to perform any kind of services including abortion, specifically in abortion?</text>

            <text syncTime="907.031" offset="3732543">Your question was specifically whether the states could totally ban physicians from advertising their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.178" offset="3765144">The Court's never decided; it's come close to it perhaps in the Head case although that there were no First Amendment issues raised there.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.352" offset="3805790">I suppose I'm affected by our culture in thinking perhaps that states can prohibit physicians from doing it because they do, but I don't know that there's ever been a serious First Amendment objection to that to present to this Court or any other court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.490" offset="5146394">First, we certainly contend that this advertisement was not pure commercial advertising, and I will address that specifically in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.531" offset="5186518">We believe that there is ample evidence in the record of editorial position being taken within the advertisement and that this is a part of the editorial position of this paper.</text>

            <label>Mr. John C. Lowe</label>
            <text syncTime="1295.442" offset="5286201">Your Honor, I am most certainly suggesting that in the context particularly of an underground newspaper where it's a hand to mouth operation where a dollar here and there helps to keep the paper going that they do accept fund from whatever source including accepting advertisement which follows their editorial policy and supports it, but which will provide some revenues, and in fact this is the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.345" offset="5373764">And I think that one of the points that has been raised is that this was a paid advertisement for a commercial profit organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.415" offset="5414097">Now, the fact that it was paid has been disposed off in New York Times against Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.430" offset="5430084">That clearly does not remove the First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.677" offset="5443145">The fact that it was allegedly a profit-making organization is only in the record because of the May-June issue of the Virginia Weekly which is in the record in kind relating to an acknowledgement by the Weekly Staff on page 5 where it states, “The weekly collective has since learned that this abortion agency, as well as a number of other commercial groups aren't charging women for a fee for a service which is done free by Women's Liberation, Planned Parenthood.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.196" offset="5569160">In other words, this -- and this was submitted by the Commonwealth and yet does support factually the contention that at the time this ad was inserted, at the time the offense took place, the staff of this newspaper thought that they were simply one more group of the radical left wing or whoever it is, it is urging the editorial policy of this newspaper which was supporting it and was doing a free service to people that they genuinely felt needed abortion counseling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.049" offset="5676575">Only later they find that these abortion advertisement services, Women's Pavilion, was actually making money on it, and to their great chagrin they announced it here with some anger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.541" offset="5722551">I think that points out graphically that this was not a commercial advertisement in the sense that they knew this was a profit making venture, but rather was a part and extension of editorial policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.775" offset="5823488">In fact, in the May-June issue, there is editorial writing and I might point out Mr. Chief Justice that the Attorney General of Virginia has stated that this is not an underground newspaper or at least that there is nothing in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.828" offset="5879704">I think within the limits of the English language in the minds of man to create an underground newspaper, the May-June 1971 issue is such a newspaper if there are any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.450" offset="5918156">It has all the revolutionary rhetoric, all of the anti-establishment epithets, the whole spectrum of underground newspapership, and in fact it has, in many issues, and I believe in this one also, little boxes of information.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.600" offset="6014809">No, Your Honor, and one of the reasons and again I have to state that in the trial court in the initial two trial courts we have a two-tier system in Virginia of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.008" offset="6052425">The issue of commercialism was never raised by the Commonwealth, never raised by the court and did not come up and there was no record made on it other than these two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.718" offset="6087220">The issue which is in whole and of course the advertisement itself, but in fact, the editorial policy is supported by advertisements by notices which you might call advertisement but which are really insertions of little boxes of information where you go for certain types of information if you want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.658" offset="6159005">Now, in the context of the case of Broderick against Oklahoma which we have cited in our brief, this Court discussed the overbreadth doctrine, but in fact, I think Broderick really related more to a changing view where the First Amendment activity was conduct rather than speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.714" offset="6227237">There, of course the Court stated that conduct would have to be real and substantial overbreadth if it were going to be overruled rather than in a pure speech where a defendant or an appellant could assert hypothetical rights of others in overturning a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.843" offset="6295782">Now, the Attorney General in this case does not really contest the idea that this might be overbroad if it is a First Amendment issue, but merely contests the standing and says there is no First Amendment issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.832" offset="6343743">We have of course a pure speech question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.537" offset="6358580">I don't think there's much question that we're not involved in conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.303" offset="6369656">This is an advertisement, it's a mere advocacy insofar as it had editorial content and we believe that the, as I have mentioned before, the commercialism does not really get in the way of a fact that it is pure speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.171" offset="6429111">We believe that the record itself shows that there's an editorial policy which is supported by the advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.039" offset="6456592">Now, in the context of Broderick, we do have a very substantial overbreadth here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.115" offset="6476863">The hypothetical situations we have outlined in our brief are very substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.136" offset="6492954">Under the Virginia law, a doctor could not advise his patient to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.148" offset="6508941">A husband could not urge his wife to have an abortion if they had an unwanted pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.472" offset="6526286">An editorial in a newspaper could not urge abortions to cut down on population explosions, speeches, the zero population group, all of these groups would be illegal if they so much as urge abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.509" offset="6578427">This was a very burning social issue particularly before the Roe against Wade and Doe against Bolton decisions, and it is still a very burning issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.856" offset="6619805">Now, the fact that there is a substantial chill on First Amendment activity is pointed out by the Commonwealth Exhibit number 3 in the record which is a Cavalier Daily, University of Virginia newspaper of 1970 in which there was an article attributing to the Attorney General of Virginia a warning to the Virginia Commonwealth University School Newspaper that they better not publish any abortion advertisements for abortion referrals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.886" offset="6731922">I think that clearly when the Attorney General of Virginia issue warnings you must have chilling effect on rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.950" offset="6760239">Now, we again following, the Broderick type of analysis, we do not have here an ordinary criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.950" offset="6784167">This is a law which is specifically designed and aimed at abortion advertisements and not illegal advertisements in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.619" offset="6810917">And in response to your -- further response to your question Mr. Chief Justice as to whether a state, for example, could not prohibit absolutely advertisements with rates listed in there, I think that Pittsburgh Press teaches us that if the advertised information is itself illegal, such as discriminatory sex hiring, then that is a different category entirely and if the state, for example, prohibited physicians from advertising rates or from posting rates or from telling people rates of abortions, then I think clearly they could then under Pittsburgh Press find the advertisement to be an illegal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.989" offset="6976324">Now, we disagree with Pittsburgh Press but that I think I have to concede if I can see that the court is talking about Pittsburg Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.301" offset="7005581">In addition, I think the real danger there is that the state would come up with law that says, it shall be unlawful for a newspaper to publish an ad which is illegal, and leave it up to the press to worry in advance of every advertisement it put in whether it might violate some hiring law or might some housing law or some professional law at the risk of publishing at all to where newspaper perhaps would have to restrict greatly the type of ads that it took.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.278" offset="7873473">The question in this case is not whether 18.1-63 denies a woman, a right to have an abortion or interferes with the right of a woman to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.269" offset="7913493">Clearly it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.290" offset="7921539">This is not an abortion case; it is a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.550" offset="7938570">It's important to note at the outset, however, that the appellant does not contend that the statute was passed with intent to muzzle or curb the press or that the statute has the effect of threatening the financial viability of the newspaper or that the statute in pass in any significant way, the newspaper ability to be published or distributed or that the statute infringes upon the layout or organizational decisions of the newspaper, nor where the record support any such contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.852" offset="8075766">The appellant was convicted for running in his newspaper, a purely commercial advertisement for a commercial abortion referral agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.884" offset="8111919">The question in this case then is whether the state is barred from prohibiting purely commercial advertisements for the sale of medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.354" offset="8149849">The Supreme Court of Virginia found the advertisement to be purely commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.831" offset="8171687">This finding is amply supported by a fair reading of the advertisement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.630" offset="8198959">As stated by the court below, the advertisement constituted an active offer to performance a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.781" offset="8227485">It clearly does not have the attributes nor does it serve the vital function of constitutionally protect of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.140" offset="8256951">The court below correctly recognized the fact that they had clearly exceeded in informational status, while the appellate would have this Court extract a few line here and there from the advertisement and be blinded to the remainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.799" offset="8327586">This cannot be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.522" offset="8338453">The advertisement is a single document contained within four corners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.626" offset="8362904">It appears on page 3 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.097" offset="8380771">Each line, each statement is geared to making the offer sufficiently attractove to entice would be purchases of the service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.300" offset="11913571">I would also draw the Court's attention to the fact that when Mr. Lowe was up he called the Court's attention to an editorial on abortion which appeared in the subsequent issue of this very paper published by the appellant, and for which the appellant was never arrested or convicted or any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.550" offset="11994551">The statute is not meant to direct itself to editorials.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.156" offset="12029032">It's meant -- the Supreme Court of Virginia has construed the statute to pertain only to commercial advertising of these abortion services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.752" offset="12103429">The advertisement does not express a position whether a woman should bear a child, nor does it criticize Virginia's abortion laws or their enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.856" offset="12155779">Now, the appellant does contend that the mere running of the advertisement constitutes an implicit editorial opinion on the subject matter of the ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.168" offset="12197052">Such a contention however is totally lacking the support in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.875" offset="12219935">There's no evidence in this record that the newspaper had a perfectly acknowledge policy of accepting certain advertisements and rejecting others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.351" offset="12261836">To be sure, the concept that the mere running of an advertisement constitutes in editorial endorsement of the subject matter of the ad would undoubtedly appall the editorial's test of the nation's newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.267" offset="12333516">The fact that they ran an ad in their newspaper and the mere running of that advertisement constituted an editorial opinion would undoubtedly appalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.448" offset="12382208">In short, the commercial advertising in this case is not stripped of its commercial character in any way, shape, or form by editorial judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.901" offset="12427975">The advertisement published by the appellant does nothing more than propose a commercial transaction, and because it is pure commercial speech, it is unprotected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.891" offset="12475935">Unlike the commercial advertisement -- excuse me, unlike the non-commercial advertisement in New York Times versus Sullivan, this advertisement did not express opinion, recite grievances, protest claim abuses, or seek financial support on behalf of any movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.157" offset="12548974">Pure commercial speech is neither intended to be nor does it have the effect of contributing to public debate like the ad in question here, its intent and effect is simply to propose a business transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.666" offset="12619086">Because we are dealing with pure commercial speech unprotected by the First Amendment, we turn then to what is the interest of the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.664" offset="12647090">The interest of the Commonwealth as I related earlier to Mr. Justice Marshall is that the Commonwealth has a right, a valid interest, in saying that people who render these important services are not motivated of pure of financial gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.284" offset="12725561">They do not get into unseemly cut rate actions that they are interested in the welfare of the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.826" offset="12759730">If my reading of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton is correct, this Court bottom its decisions on the professionalism, on the professional judgment of the doctor in the first trimester.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.798" offset="12827544">This statute like Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton vindicates that professional judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.109" offset="12876863">The Supreme Court of Virginia found that this statute was directed to commercial advertising and it was directed to the purpose of keeping these commercial practices and pressures out of this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.577" offset="12934750">I would call the attention of the Court to the New York cases cited by the Supreme Court of Virginia in its decisions, cases in which it was found abortion referral agencies for profit abortion of referral agencies where during substantial amount of advertising where acting as little men for doctors, were soliciting for and splitting fees with doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.892" offset="13031926">And most importantly, those cases disclosed that these abortion referral agencies had no follow up procedures after abortions that the women were cast off after the service have been performed.</text>
