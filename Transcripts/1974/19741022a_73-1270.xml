            <label>Mr. R. Jay Engel</label>
            <text syncTime="39.851" offset="262771">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.367" offset="264861">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.811" offset="274578">Ostensibly the issue that is appearing before Your Honors is whether this Court should set new guidelines for determining employee status under the FELA or the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.887" offset="322957">Southern Pacific Company was successful in maintaining in the Ninth Circuit that the District Court had applied a new legal theory in creating employee status under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.940" offset="375097">This new legal theory purportedly comes from the Fourth Circuit in a case called Smith versus Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.613" offset="401847">Petitioner not only disagrees with Southern Pacific's contention as to what the theory or legal theory is that is set forth in Smith, but further petitioner believes that there is a threshold issue here that is not been briefed nor argued either by the Ninth Circuit nor by Southern Pacific Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.650" offset="481991">Contrary to Southern Pacific Company's analysis, both the trial court, the District Court and both parties recognized that a factual question was being submitted and that the Court was going to render a factual conclusion as opposed to a legal conclusion because the Ninth Circuit did not consider this issue and did not consider whether or not the trial court or District Court was in fact rendering a factual conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.644" offset="597974">The Ninth Circuit simply ignored the issues with regard to the limitations on its appellate review power in a appellate court or a Circuit Court reviewing a factual determination by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.295" offset="660564">I suggest that what's at the heart of this matter is that the Ninth Circuit desires to have this Court postulate a new theory, a new theory with regard to a determining employee status.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.322" offset="708629">And to accomplish this, what the Ninth Circuit did is, it selected a single fact or finding by the District Court and it singled out a single authority that was relied on by the trial court or the Ninth Circuit and then ignored all the other findings, and it ignored all the other authorities that were relied on by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.160" offset="792012">Now the reason I suggest that this Court is before or this case is before this Court is that the Ninth Circuit fail to recognized its -- the factual consideration was rendered by the District Court and that the Ninth Circuit's appropriate appellate review power was to deal with it as a factual conclusion and to uphold the District Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.305" offset="892635">The Tenth Circuit in a very similar type of case, the Missouri Kansas versus Hearson harmonized and set forth both the Smith decision and the Ninth Circuit decisions as authority for a single proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.262" offset="956374">The Tenth Circuit had no problem at all recognizing that Smith versus Norfolk did not set forth a new legal theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.157" offset="988035">And I suggest to this Court that the analysis that the Tenth Circuit may in the Missouri-Kansas versus Hearson decision is a correct analysis of the Smith decision and is the same analysis that the District Court made in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.753" offset="1066402">The result of the Ninth Circuit's decision in this matter is that it is the only appellate decision which has overturned a District Court's factual conclusion as to what constitutes an employee under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.950" offset="1127215">Their decisions both ways in the District Courts, where District Courts have rendered conclusions that a person was not an employee and there are decisions where the District Court has concluded that a person employed by an independent contractor was an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.304" offset="1188551">And the Ninth Circuit review is the only decision where those type of preliminary factual conclusions were made by District Court has been overturned.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.441" offset="1397112">I recognize that that is rather a strong statement and certainly could be interpreted in the [Attempt to Laughter] manner that, Your Honor is suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.299" offset="1428564">I think that court was trying in all good faith to render a very appropriate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.385" offset="1456880">But I think that what the Court did come up with was an obvious conflict in the decision -- in the circuits when in fact, the issue that was presented to the Ninth Circuit was whether a factual determination had been made by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.283" offset="1528456">So then when I say, they intentionally made a conflict, what I'm suggesting is that they were aware that they were creating a conflict and that that did not cause them -- it did not cause him to follow the Fourth Circuit is what it amounted to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.628" offset="5973870">As I perceive the issue in this case, it is shall the FELA law be extended to include persons other than employees of railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.102" offset="6027786">All of the cases cited by all of the parties save and except one, make a finding of employment by a railroad, whether its through a borrowed-servant doctrine, a joint-servant doctrine, an alter ego doctrine or some doctrine, they all make a finding of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.342" offset="6092779">Counsel says that the Tenth Circuit harmonizes the Ninth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.536" offset="6113468">The Tenth Circuit case he has in mind is Hearson versus the K-T Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.798" offset="6146591">It's cited in the briefs in it's 422 F. 2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.795" offset="6162578">The Court finds in Hearson, Hearson was an employee of the K-T.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.550" offset="6189537">In other words, the K-T sold its car cleaning facilities to try to avoid the consequences of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.889" offset="6218898">But they kept control over Mr. Hearson and the Court says it doesn't matter whether he sweeps from the right or the left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.958" offset="6243244">The point is the railroad still maintained the necessary control and because they did that, Mr. Hearson continued to be an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.070" offset="6279607">Now, he also relies and he just cited that a Circuit Court case, Byrne versus Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.664" offset="6302072">There, you had Westinghouse engineer whose job it was to service sophisticated locomotives after they were sold to the company, the railroad company, and he came on the railroad property, and he worked on these locomotives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.510" offset="6353377">And he came under the control of the railroad and that case held, he was a joint employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.761" offset="6374379">There was a conventional common law employment relationship that developed which was not developed in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.414" offset="10293060">About 1950, the railroads started what was known as piggy back service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2583.740" offset="10438301">Then in the early 60's, the railroad, the railroads of this country designed what's knows as bi-level and tri-level cars and they did a way with putting the trucks -- the autos on the trucks on the cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.714" offset="11154265">That's what Section 5 is all about, but Section 5 doesn't deal with contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.932" offset="11175058">But you see, contracting out can be handled by other laws and institutions, not by an improper interpretation contrary to legislative intent of the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.666" offset="11230020">The FELA said -- that Congress said and this Court said Congress said it six years ago, “that the FELA only applies to employees of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.418" offset="11273070">” Now with that in mind, this Court shouldn't strain to worry about contracting out and in the process, improperly interpret the FELA for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.511" offset="11325419">Contracting out will be prevented by the Railway Labor Act and by the United Transportation Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.270" offset="11352482">If the railroad decided, it would be a good idea to contract out all the work of our locomotive engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.901" offset="11382993">The unions would file a Section 6 notice and there would be a nationwide strike sooner or later, and they couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.883" offset="11410892">So I think, it's so highly theoretical and to worry about theoretical things like that and interpret the Act where it shouldn't go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.127" offset="11451852">Where this Court says it shouldn't go six years ago would be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.936" offset="11479124">Another thing I want to point out to you about contracting out why it wouldn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.801" offset="11498559">The railroad operations, pick a train moving from San Francisco to Salt Lake City is a very integrated type of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.344" offset="11532727">The engineer has to rely on the conductor for his signals who has to rely on the brakeman, who has to rely on the dispatcher, who has to rely on someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.887" offset="11566895">If you contracted out the work of the conductors or the brakemen or the engineer, those people would still be controlled by the railroad because it's still so integrated and this Court wouldn't have any trouble finding if the contracting out came to pass, which it won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.258" offset="11640456">This Court wouldn't have any difficulty finding, the railroad still maintaining control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.741" offset="11662294">The conductor is still telling the engineer when to move, the train dispatcher still telling them when they can leave the station, the train master still running the show, there is still requisite control and supervision over these employees who have been contracted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.676" offset="11722062">So, the railroad may think it's contracting them out but this court would hold that the control is still there, the control that is not in the Kelley case.</text>
