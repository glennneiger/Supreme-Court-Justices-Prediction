            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="10.434" offset="41691">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.240" offset="68859">The Government sought reinstatement of respondent's conviction for robbery on the ground that since respondent chose to testify in his own behalf that it was permissible to impeach his credibility by providing that he had chosen to remain silent at the time of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.550" offset="142106">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold that the respondent's silence during police interrogation lack significant probative value and under these circumstances, any reference to his silence carried with it an intolerably prejudicial impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.159" offset="220578">Looking through the circumstances of this case, we hold that the fault -- failure of respondent who had just been given Miranda warnings to respond during custodial interrogation to inquiry about money in his possession can as easily connote reliance on the right to remain silent as to support an inference that his trial testimony was a later fabrication.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.234" offset="312842">Additionally, we find no indication that the respondent's prior silence was so clearly inconsistent with his trial testimony as to warrant admission into evidence of his silence as a prior inconsistent statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.436" offset="369685">In view of the strong potential for prejudice from admission of the evidence, a mistrial should have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.925" offset="399673">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.636" offset="414511">The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas, and Mr. Justice White have filed separate opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.668" offset="446589">And Mr. Justice Blackmun has concurred in the result.</text>
