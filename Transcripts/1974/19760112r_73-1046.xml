            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">At 1 o’clock, we will hear arguments in Matthews against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.795" offset="75128">Mrs. Shapiro, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="29.216" offset="116820">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.540" offset="130090">This case is here on direct appeal by the Government from the decision of a Three-Judge District Court in the Southern district of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.192" offset="160705">Like the preceding case, it involves the challenge to the Federal Government’s power to classify on the basis of alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.156" offset="188604">But this case challenges an illegitimate classification, which limits eligibility to a federal health insurance program for the elderly, Medicare part B or supplementary Medicare and medical insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.828" offset="243252">Part B is part of the social security system.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.831" offset="255269">The major part of that system is of course old age and survivor's insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.643" offset="274495">Eligibility for those benefits depends on age and past work and covered employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.262" offset="296960">It is equally available to aliens and citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.338" offset="313260">This basic retirement insurance is supplemented by Medicare parts A, B.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.360" offset="333427">Part A provides hospitalization insurance, and B provides insurance covering certain other medical costs such as doctor’s fees and medicines.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.007" offset="371984">Since part A and B were intended to supplement the basic retirement systems, both are made available to anyone, alien or citizen who is entitled to social security benefits or indeed to railroad retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.804" offset="427154">Appellees’ complaint is that they are denied Equal Protection because sub part B is also available to citizens without regard to their work and covered employment, but to non-covered aliens, only if they have been admitted for permanent residence and lived her for five-years.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.235" offset="500924">Our principle answer to that complaint is that Equal Protection analysis is simply not relevant in considering the constitutional nullity of federal statutes, which distinguish between citizens and aliens in their status as aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.331" offset="561319">And if Equal Protection analysis is relevant at all, the scope of judicial view in this case is extra ordinarily limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.167" offset="588591">Certainly, no more than the traditional rational basis test is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.173" offset="604682">Our arguments along these lines were thoroughly discussed this morning and I do not plan to go over that ground again.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.773" offset="635089">Instead, I would like to focus on the Medicare statute and show that if a rational basis test is to be applied, the statute is clearly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.637" offset="678452">But first, I want to speak briefly of the jurisdictional issues in light of this Court’s recent decision in Weinberger versus Salfi.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.549" offset="714188">The appellees are three aliens who brought this suit as a class action to challenge the Secretary’s refusal to enroll them in Medicare part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.141" offset="752536">Clara and Diaz are Cuban refugees who are allowed to enter the country in 1971 under special Immigration Act Provision permitting the temporary entry of people in emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.304" offset="809169">They are thus parolees and have not under the specific terms of the Immigration Act been admitted for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.934" offset="847726">Espinosa is a Colombian who was admitted for permanent residence in June of 1971, thus, none of the appellees are entitled to enroll simply on the basis of their residence in this country, as they would be if they were citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.752" offset="918988">Clara and Diaz applied for enrollment.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.914" offset="931631">They were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.742" offset="938945">Without asking for a rehearing, they brought this suit for judicial review of the denial, claiming jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C 405 (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="245.222" offset="980846">This of course is the same jurisdictional basis at it was involved in Salfi.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.076" offset="1000281">Espinosa joined the suit and then filed a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.366" offset="1017417">The Three-Judge District Court found that the administrative exhaustion required by 405 (g) would be futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.358" offset="1045420">It then certified as a class, all immigrants who have been or will be denied enrollment in sub-part B because they are not aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who have lived here for five-years.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.020" offset="1104039">The Court also established subclass, which was represented only by the appellee Espinosa consisting of those who have been or will be denied enrollment solely because of their failure to meet the five-year residence requirement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="290.269" stopTime="298.939">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="290.269" offset="1160986">Was that certification without regard to whether the members of the class had individually made application to the socials, the secretary or its delegates.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harriet_s_shapiro" startTime="298.939" stopTime="351.610">
            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="298.939" offset="1195677">Yes, necessarily because it had included those who will be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.080" offset="1212291">There is no, because that was before Salfi, there was no indication.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.437" offset="1237682">The District Court then held the entire alien eligibility requirement for Medicare Part B unconstitutional and it permanently enjoined the Secretary from relying on that requirement to deny enrollment to the class members and after a short stay, the Order became effective in August 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.741" offset="1310929">So, the entire class was enrolled and has been insured since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.004" offset="1339977">As in Salfi, there was no allegation that the class members had even filed an application with the Secretary much less that he had not rendered any decision filing or otherwise, review of which was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.585" offset="1386266">Thus, as in Salfi, the class was improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.610" offset="1406433">Mrs. Harriet, if you could leave out the will be part of the class and just limit it to the have been, would there be anyone in the class other than the named plaintiffs?</text>

            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="371.042" offset="1484069">Yes, there certainly could have been, but there certainly was no -- the District Court made the determination themselves that itself that further review by the Secretary would have been futile and Salfi indicates that the Secretary must make that determination.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="383.850" stopTime="391.562">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="383.850" offset="1535373">What I really want to know is, is your only objection of the class to the will be portion of it or do you object anything more than that?</text>

          <turn speaker="harriet_s_shapiro" startTime="391.562" stopTime="444.224">

            <text syncTime="391.562" offset="1566198">I do not really think that the class issue is a problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.242" offset="1592947">For one thing, because there was no stay, the class members have been being paid or have been enrolled and of course, the decision of this Court, because this Court has jurisdiction because the District Court held the statute unconstitutional same ways as it was in Salfi.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.766" offset="1679047">The Secretary has determined as in Salfi again that there was jurisdiction because there was a final decision over Clara and Diaz, it was final administrative determination as to Clara and Diaz and this Court’s determination will bind the Secretary for the future as to everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.005" offset="1795971">I gather at least two of this three were proper before the district.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.571" offset="1814256">But even assuming that they were entitled to relief, I gather your submission is that the only relief individually to have the Secretary’s termination reverse, is that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="465.487" offset="1861904">And that under no circumstances where those two individuals entitled to injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.238" offset="2192927">Our main point, I suppose on the class action aspect is, that the error, because the Order was not stated, the error has cost the Government about $2 million, something over $2 million for 1975 alone, but essentially that is water over the dam at this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.008" offset="2784026">What happened after the state was dissolved, was that the social security, I mean ATW paid under the order everybody whose applications were in the pipeline at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.062" offset="2884232">I think when you are thinking about the retro-activity issue here and the whole class action issue, it is kind of important to remember that what is involved here is an application and then payment of a premium by the applicant and insurance from that point forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.004" offset="2959987">So that to go back and say when you enrolled and we denied you but we are going to reopen it and then you have to pay us the monthly premiums and we get insurance for period when you may or may not had been sick.</text>

            <text syncTime="774.677" offset="3098645">He did not apply for enrollment until after he joined the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.191" offset="3112751">Because of the litigation and the District Court's injunction against denying him enrollment, his application has in fact never been adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.424" offset="3145665">It is rather hard to see how there kind have been a final decision as to him for meeting review under 405 (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="793.812" offset="3175236">But the appellees point out that the secretary has nevertheless in effect stipulated that his claim had been finally denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.537" offset="3206060">That may not be an entirely accurate reading of the stipulation originally made.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.030" offset="3224033">But we do agree that the District Court and the parties assumed before Salfi that Espinosa’s application was to be treated as if it had been finally denied by the secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.033" offset="3272098">The secretary has concluded that but before the injunction, the application would have been denied solely because of Espinosa’s failure to meet the alien inter provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.240" offset="3312953">As a technical matter, we do not believe that the stipulation here cures the lack of any decision, not alone and a final one.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.891" offset="3343464">But the circumstances of this particular case, especially the fact that it was litigated before Salfi may justify reading this stipulation liberally and concluding that the secretary has now foreclosed from denying that there had been a final denial of Espinosa’s claim sufficient to satisfy 405 (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="855.187" offset="3420682">Perhaps the most important point here is the wisdom of Salfi’s emphasis on the need for final administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.175" offset="3452656">Because when adjudication of Espinosa’s application was interrupted, there was some indication that he was entitled to enroll because he had worked in covered employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.308" offset="3489228">In fact, he had not, but Salfi recognizes that 405 (g) and H protect the Courts from being asked to consider constitutional issues until that kind of factual question has been finally settled administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.031" offset="3552026">It is important for the Court not to retreat from that principle here.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.443" offset="3917740">The merits are either in Clara and Diaz that if Espinosa is out of the case then you have somewhat more leeway in how you – which ones of the various issues, there are that you can attack, you can decide and settle the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.168" offset="3992660">This case involves both an alienage classification and social welfare legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.307" offset="4013140">The Solicitor General explained this morning, why we believe that alienage classifications of the sort involved here are simply not subject to attack on Equal Protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.513" offset="4050024">He argued alternatively, if they are subject to such an attack, only the most attenuated rational basis test is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.072" offset="4080222">And a narrow rational basis test is also appropriate here because the case involves social welfare legislation and Salfi is the most recent expression of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.920" offset="4123585">In that connection, I want only to emphasis that under the test reaffirmed in Salfi and as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.749" offset="4154932">This Court need not consider whether the asserted justification actually motivated Congress in making the classification nor whether a different classification would have served equally well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.669" offset="4202580">The enrollment limitations here are rationally related to both legitimate immigration and social insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.030" offset="4232046">First, it is rational in terms of both policies to treat aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence differently from others who have not expressed their intent to remain here indefinitely and have not submitted to the screening necessary to establish their right to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.774" offset="4302994">That distinction, we believe is self evidently reasonable when applied to most non-immigrant aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.280" offset="4329117">People like illegal entrants, diplomats, visitors, members of cruise of foreign ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.700" offset="4354717">Certainly, Congress is not constitutionally required to provide subsidized medical insurance to such temporary residents in this country just because it does so for citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.419" offset="4405603">It is also reasonable for Congress to conclude that parolees like Clara and Diaz should be treated like temporary residents until they have been admitted for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.337" offset="4445309">They were given refuge in this country without prior screening because of emergency conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.037" offset="4468088">The statute under which they entered specifically requires their return to the country from which they came when the emergency ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.272" offset="4501002">They apparently wish to remain here permanently since they have applied for adjustment of their status to that of permanent immigrants, permanent resident immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.915" offset="4535589">If they meet immigration standards, their status will be adjusted retroactive to the time at which they entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.303" offset="4565159">But until that has been done, they are here at the discretion of the attorney general for the duration of the emergency and thus can reasonably be considered more like temporary visitors than permanent residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.978" offset="4615837">The five-year residents requirement is also a rational expression of immigration policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.800" offset="4639138">It is the essence of Congressional immigration policy to decide the extent to which immigration will be encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.798" offset="4671112">A person considering immigration will normally consider the cost of living in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.109" offset="4692428">Part of that cost is the cost of medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.546" offset="4706116">If subsidized Government insurance is available, the cost will be lower than if it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.819" offset="4731193">If it is available after five-years, the cost is less than if it is not available at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.413" offset="4753554">Immigration of the elderly has thus encouraged by making such insurance available to them but not encouraged as much as if it were available immediately on entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.205" offset="4792738">Even more explicitly, the Immigration Act expresses the policy that aliens who are likely to become public chargers are not to be admitted as immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.561" offset="4830145">The practical effect of that requirement for immigrants over 60 which is of course the people that are involved in the Medicare eligibility provision, is that they must either be economically independent or have someone here who will assume responsibility for their support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.675" offset="4894616">But the Medicare limitation simply defines the extent of that support obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.824" offset="4915200">So the effect of the immigration statute and the Medicare statute together is the same as if Congress had provided explicitly in the immigration Act that elderly immigrants must undertake to provide for their own medical care for five-years, either through private insurance or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.042" offset="4980088">Congress could certainly have done that directly through provisions in the Immigration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.051" offset="5000150">Congress has an equal right to do it indirectly through the Medicare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.765" offset="5018958">We believe this Court really need go no further than that to reject the petitioner’s claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.957" offset="5043827">But the alien eligibility limitation also reflects valid social welfare policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.708" offset="5070785">The fact that Medicare part B is available to all citizens over 65 means that it supplements all the retirement systems in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.492" offset="5105894">Principally, of course social security, also the Railroad Retirements Act, the civil service and even the military retirement provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.002" offset="5135987">Medicare cannot reasonably be considered apart from the systems, all our programs to provide for the elderly in their retirement years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.924" offset="5171618">All reflect a federal responsibility that to those who have contributed to the country over there working years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.366" offset="5197427">All are based in part on the individual contributions of the workers and impart on taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.748" offset="5222922">Since Medicare part B supplements all of them, the federal contributions reasonably come from general revenues rather than from taxes on individual employers, as I do in the individual systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.715" offset="5270779">In any case, the mechanics of funding should not obscure the fact that what is involved here is a supplement to retirement systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.464" offset="5309753">Supplementary medical insurance like the systems, which it supplements, is made available in recognition of past contributions to the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.483" offset="5353848">It is perfectly true that resident aliens like citizens pay taxes and contribute in many other ways to our economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.410" offset="5385613">Citizens ordinarily do so over their working lives and when they become 65, they may enroll in Medicare part B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.305" offset="5417169">Congress concluded that an alien who has made similar contributions for only five years may also enroll in Medicare part B at 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.018" offset="5452069">That is surely is not discriminating against the alien in the allocation of tax funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.567" offset="5474220">The District Court was troubled by the fact that chronically indigent citizens who may never have paid taxes are contributing in any way to the economy are entitled to Medicare, while aliens like appellees are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.732" offset="5522913">There are two answers to that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.387" offset="5533466">First, as Salfi reminds us, Congress may use broad classifications to avoid the administrative burden of case by case determinations of eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.871" offset="5575471">Since entitlement to Medicare is fundamentally based on entirely to retirement benefits and citizens are far more likely to meet this requirement than aliens who are admitted within five years of their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.964" offset="5627820">It is reasonable to require proof of eligibility only of the aliens and not of the citizens, even currently indigent citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.378" offset="5661466">But there is another justification for permitting the enrollment of indigent citizens and not recent immigrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.625" offset="5686439">Both provisions protect State Welfare funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.608" offset="5702426">The enrollment of indigents means that federal funds pay medical expenses, the States would otherwise have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.324" offset="5733251">Denial of Medicare to recent immigrants discourages the entry of those most likely to become State charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.604" offset="5762403">The fact that the immigration laws have the same effect with regard to the immigrants simply means that the two Acts are consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.137" offset="5796467">It certainly does not mean that either is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.486" offset="5821858">Appellees emphasize that an elderly alien's need for subsidize medical insurance is likely to be as great as that of an elderly citizen, that is undoubtedly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.425" offset="5865639">But they also claim that the only purpose of Medicare part B is to provide medical insurance to those who need it and that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.888" offset="5903464">Legislative classifications in the social welfare field almost always are the result of many considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.383" offset="5933453">But no social welfare classification can be made without balancing needs against costs and these will vary from statute to statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.416" offset="5973577">This of course means that the classifications made will vary from statute to statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.140" offset="5992490">For instance, in the program providing for supplementary federal welfare payments for elderly, blind and disabled indigents, Congress provided more generously for aliens than it did in the Medicare statue, and there it included all aliens who are in this country under color of law that the needs and the costs that were being evaluated in the welfare statute that issued there were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.239" offset="6092904">And so a different balance was struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.326" offset="6105234">This Court has always recognized that making that balance is a legislative function not to be disturbed so long as there is a rational justification for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.147" offset="6140552">Here, the underlying justification is that the needs of those with a substantial relation to the country are recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.927" offset="6167615">But the needs of those whose relationship is essentially temporary are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.482" offset="6185900">Congress drew a line which is reasonable in terms of that justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.643" offset="6202514">The District Court is changing of that line is now costing the Government over 2 million dollars annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.986" offset="6227905">And that price would probably grow up in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.877" offset="6239504">Congress frequently reevaluates Medicare and it may someday decide that appellees needs to justify that burden on the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.311" offset="6269179">It has not done so yet and that is not a decision for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.059" offset="6300212">I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.912" offset="6339605">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.887" offset="6351517">The argument as to jurisdiction, is contained in our supplemental reply brief and I think after hearing Mrs. Shapiro this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.318" offset="6385267">I think we are basically in agreement, there is clearly jurisdiction as to Diaz and Clara and as I read Mrs. Shapiro’s position, there is a concession that the Government did stipulate to the finality of the decision regarding Mr. Espinosa and that stipulation as to finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.861" offset="6455380">Therefore, means that the Court has jurisdiction as to Espinosa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.016" offset="6468023">The class matter, I think is not really very important if the statute falls in this case as to Espinosa than it falls as to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.717" offset="6498847">But I think for the reasons that I have pointed out in my supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.116" offset="6512431">If you read the class as those who have been denied, then Mr. Espinosa and others who have applied and been determined not eligible would be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.099" offset="6552346">I think the important part of this case obviously has to do with whether or not Congress can treat aliens and discriminate against aliens in the way that the Government would like to have us believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.031" offset="6592052">The Government attempts to cast this case as one in which Congress has exercised its plenary power over immigration and under the theory that the Government advances, this statutory resident’s requirements in this case are somehow linked to the plenary power over immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.245" offset="6660911">They encourage or discourage immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.503" offset="6673972">If the Government is right, everyone of the 200 and some odd statutes that they have listed in their appendix to the Wong brief must then be read as somehow encouraging or discouraging immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.617" offset="6714410">With nothing more, no other evidence should substantiate that merely because, they classify based upon alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.997" offset="6739905">What is fatal to the Government’s theory is that, that would require the Court to indulge the assumption that all of these statutory classifications based upon alienage are somehow attempting to regulate admission or exclusion of aliens and I give the Court one example, which I think, underscores the fallaciousness of that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.234" offset="6816914">Mrs. Shapiro refers to the supplemental security income statute that is titled 42 United States code section 1382.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.001" offset="6847948">In that statute which provides a, to the aged, blind and the disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.175" offset="6868637">The Government has not drawn a line that precludes aliens from receiving those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.635" offset="6894446">People here under color of law, conditional entrance for parolees can receive those benefits using the Government’s logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.869" offset="6919419">That would mean that that statute in some way is seeking to encourage immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.899" offset="6935510">Obviously not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.251" offset="6940944">At the most, what can be said for these statutes is that when they classify based upon alienage that classification perhaps is in someway related to the benefits that the Government is extending in this case for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.289" offset="7001130">I think quite frankly what the Government is doing, what the Congress has done in this classification is, it has said that aliens with some ties to this country would be entitled to certain welfare benefits, certain health care benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.449" offset="7057763">It has not said this is encouraging or discouraging immigration, it is not related at all to immigration and I think that if one then strips the constitutional cloak of immigration power, of plenary power from this case, we come up with the statute that in many ways resembles the statutes tracked down by this Court in Graham Versus Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.572" offset="7134250">Statutes, which provide important welfare or health care benefits and then discriminate against a class of people, aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.403" offset="10881567">I think there is another way that could accomplish the purpose or just would be for Congress to do but for instance, one could draw the line between -- one could draw the line at those listed in the non-immigrant category under immigration law, which by definition would exclude all of those temporary people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.975" offset="10947814">But if instead Congress drew the line at thirty-days, I would then have to say that in thirty-days of course, you probably could not even get enrolled within thirty-day period so that might not be such a bad luck.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.056" offset="11300153">Our argument is the amalgam of the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments and we are saying that aliens today ought to be entitled to the constitutions just as aliens of a past century that were entitled to the benefits of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.319" offset="11353234">And we believe that the cases that this Court has decided recently dealing with aliens are most persuasive in affirming the decision of the Court below.</text>
