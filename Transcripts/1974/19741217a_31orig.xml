            <text syncTime="53.003" offset="315434">This original case is here on exceptions to the Report of the Special Master in reliction phase of the continuing litigation between Utah and the United States, over the ownership of land and the vicinity of the Great Salt Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.701" offset="374157">This litigation was authorized by the Great Salt Lake lands Act of 1965. Pursuant to that Act, the United States in 1967 quitclaim to Utah all of its interest other than mineral rights within the surveyed meander line of the Great Salt Lake, that line generally or not invariably, runs on land that has been above the Lake level for 50 years or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.825" offset="482722">Utah was to pay for that land that the United States stated that it owned or to litigate the United States title in an original action in this court, Utah chose to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.009" offset="527444">In the first stage of this litigation, this court held that the Great Salt Lake was inevitable and that Utah does acquired title to its bed at statehood in 1896.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.346" offset="576763">This settled the question of ownership of the land that was still underwater at the time of the deed in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.906" offset="606960">That area is the inner lighter shaded area on defendants exhibit two, the map shown in the back of the Special Master’s report.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.443" offset="649174">We are today concerned essentially with the area between the level of the Lake at statehood and the level of the Lake as of the date of the quitclaim deed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Danny Julian Boggs</label>
            <text syncTime="216.724" offset="970271">Your Honor, it’s correct that we’re discussing specifically those areas in which the United States is the upland owner across that middle land.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.466" offset="1017187">The United States contends that by operation of the doctrine of reliction as consistently recognized by this court, the Lake bed which Utah owned receded as the Lake receded and to the extent that it was the upland owner, the property interest of the United States extended down to the new water level at the date of the quitclaim deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.517" offset="1101406">Utah on the other hand, contends that the measure of what it received in 1896 was absolutely fixed as of that date and has not altered by any change in the waters of the Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.878" offset="1150934">The basic question is thus, whether the boundary between the Lake bed, undisputably owned by Utah, and the upland undisputably owned by the United States is to have been measured in 1967 with relation to the actual water level in 1967 because the boundary is an ambulatory one, or whether that boundary should have been measured with respect to where the water stood at statehood or even earlier in the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.358" offset="1272769">I would note that once it is decided as which date is the date on which the line is to be fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.570" offset="1301608">An exact line must be determined which may or may not require further litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.013" offset="1323447">Thus, the outer lighter colored band on the map would be the land between the Lake at statehood and the surveyed meander line, for as Utah contends that at statehood, it gained everything out to the meander line, the United States would contend that even if the date was fixed at statehood, that was fixed at about the Lake level of that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.899" offset="1418951">That outer band is not in consideration in the litigation today.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.565" offset="1441625">Today as I said, we are concerned with the application of the Doctrine of Reliction to the circumstances of the movements of the water of the Great Salt Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.155" offset="1476002">To first state that doctrine, I would give you what this Court said in Bonelli last term in which the Special Master quoted that the general law of reliction is that the grantee of land, bounded by a body of navigable water acquires a right to any gradual accretion formed along that shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.338" offset="1556773">And in light of that, I would look at the physical facts of the movement along the Lake which are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.894" offset="1583000">The exhibits on the Report of the Special Master, demonstrate that the waters of the Great Salt Lake do rise and fall, and as they do, considerable areas of shore are exposed or covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.040" offset="1631483">Now, one major component of this movement is the change caused by the passing of the seasons which can be seen on any of the exhibits that the Master has inserted, showing the levels of the Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.109" offset="1679757">Every winter and spring, there is a rise as precipitation on snow melt increase and every summer and fall, there is a decline because of less moisture and more evaporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.132" offset="1723852">This seasonal change of course, the parties’ all agree, does not change the boundary, not because it may be so rapid or large as to be visible or perceptible but simply because it is a seasonal change as shown by cases that we’ve sighted at pages 15 and 16 of our brief in Utah at pages 67 and 68 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.305" offset="1816639">In just the same way, an observer or a gauge on a river would note the rise of flood water seasonally or on an ocean would note extraordinary tides at certain astronomical seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.475" offset="1865226">These two, would not cause a change in the legal boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.476" offset="1881318">Another component of the change is caused by the temporary factors that may come and go in the course of a day or a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.763" offset="1914441">These are shown on Exhibit P-16 which is not reproduced in the Master’s Report but it’s simply a gauge, a continuous recording of the movements of the Lake over the period of a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.475" offset="1965223">And that exhibit and the testimony show that these changes are almost exclusively caused by a wind or atmospheric disturbance which pushes down or pushes up the Lake in one end, and then by a so called seiche effect, the lake oscillates back and forth, just as if you slash a bath tub, it will slash back and forth with diminishing vigor, rising and falling at the ends until it begins to stabilize.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.672" offset="2066056">But this too is a temporary occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.315" offset="2076609">But finally and most profoundly, the water level is changed by the effects of climate over many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.651" offset="2102000">A land that is exposed or covered may stay that way for decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.231" offset="2120286">For example, when the Lake recently rose above 4200 and one feet above sea level, it covered the land that had been dry since before 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.625" offset="2161873">And when the lake went down in the early 1960s, the land was exposed which had never been uncovered in historical time.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.135" offset="2195937">We submit that it is these long term effects only which vary the legal boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.734" offset="2218297">These changes are exactly analogous to the changes on wandering rivers such as the Missouri or Mississippi with which this court has many times dealt.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.315" offset="2252675">There, a river may move gradually in one direction for some years and then reverse itself and return to its previous location or even beyond, but of course during that movement, the river itself may be rising and falling, covering and uncovering land due to floods and droughts in temporary phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.872" offset="2330833">And yet in each of these cases, the doctrine of reliction has always been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.822" offset="2350686">I would note that a similar contention to Utah as here was made in the case of the Missouri River and the Court’s reply which is cited on page 17 of our brief stating that it is contended however that the Doctrine of Accretion has no application the Missouri River on account of the rapid and great changes constantly going on, but our conclusions are that not withstanding the rapidity of these changes, the Law of Accretion controls.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.548" offset="2461550">Well, it wasn’t what the Court was addressing itself to, the contention to parties that along the Missouri River, great big pieces of the bank would sluff off.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.757" offset="2638451">If taking the situation as a whole, you can say that there’s been a gradual or imperceptible movement when you say here it is and so many years later, here it is, that reliction will still apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="912.954" offset="3755238">So, this is where we get into the whole mathematical controversy over how gradual or perceptible it has been but that, simply because during the course of a seasonal rise and fall or during the course of a storm, the lake moves rapidly in one direction or another that this is not a unique factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.103" offset="4255744">And certainly, as I said, if the United States were to turn it off for the purpose of gaining that water, it would not be a reliction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.447" offset="4461171">I would turn now to the specific components required for the operation of the Doctrine of Reliction and to examine how they apply to the facts of the Great Salt Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.324" offset="4496697">The key element in the past perhaps before Bonelli, has certainly been that the movement in the waters edge is not sudden or violent but gradual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.056" offset="4531597">This is stated in various holdings of this Court such as Philadelphia Company versus Stimpson, stating that the title would be fixed and would remain the same when there is a change that is sudden or violent or visible in a word an evulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.711" offset="4590216">Now here, all parties agree that no evulsion has taken place and as we have noted in our brief, there are normally -- when you see the water at one place today and another place 20 years later, there is a presumption, that it has moved by a reliction or an accretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.613" offset="4749876">I don’t believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.777" offset="4754474">The doctrines have generally been spoken of together and have not been differentiated in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.929" offset="4791045">Now, the brief discussed at some length the question of just what movement should be measured and whether that movement is imperceptible and I’m prepared to discuss that further if you wish. But we would note that in Bonelli, this Court casts considerable doubt upon the necessity even for literal imperceptibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.578" offset="4861680">The court in Bonelli noted the interest and the policies behind reliction saying, that a riparian owner has an expectancy and an interest in remaining riparian to his land and that, since he might lose the use of his land when the water rises, so he should gain the land that would be exposed when the water falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.768" offset="4946422">And in Bonelli, the court found those policies so strong that it held that a riparian owner was entitled to remain riparian even though the land, the water actually moved perceptibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.128" offset="4999920">Thus, the Master statement that he could not find the movements of the lake to be imperceptible, does not necessarily defeat the application of the Doctrine of Reliction after Bonelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.824" offset="5046627">In any event, as we essentially -- the same answer we would give to the Hardy salt question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.127" offset="5071914">The examples given by the Master at pages 17 to 20 of his report about these great fluctuations, each example that he speaks of are essentially the seasonal and daily changes that we spoke of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.088" offset="5127711">Now, we concede that during a seasonal rise or during a storm, you can look at the water's edge and you may be able to see it move.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.306" offset="5156551">But certainly, in the course of a Missouri River flood or a Bay of Fundy spring tide, the effect on the shore lands would be equally visible and perhaps even more dramatic than these changes on the Great Salt Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.293" offset="5208586">Now, the second factor on which the master relied was whether the changes in the lake were reasonably permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.712" offset="5234186">A close reading of his conclusions of law in fact, I think indicates that this was the bedrock of his decision because he first stated that the federal common law of reliction does generally apply and then stated that the question of ownership of the lands in question, “depends on whether the exposure of the land referred to, either by a perceptible or a gradual and imperceptible process,” thus, perhaps taking account of this change in Bonelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.081" offset="5351737">“Constituted a reasonably permanent or stable addition to the riparian land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.314" offset="5384652">And this foundation of the Master's Report, we contend is simply not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.677" offset="5406072">Certainly, none of this court’s cases over the past century and more have indicated that there can be no reliction or accretion if the body of water under consideration may reverse its course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.694" offset="5454137">In fact, many of those cases concerned body of water that were known for wandering back and forth such as the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.103" offset="5947747">If it would have relicted more, that’s exactly the opposite -- that’s exactly the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.058" offset="5963630">If the Lake had gone further down, we could not have asked Utah to pay for that land because they would have already owned it in 1967 as a result of this Courts decision on the navigability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.094" offset="6015770">And that’s what -- the water went up and you might say that Utah lost its gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.236" offset="6036355">They’re being asked to pay for land that’s now under water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.800" offset="6046595">If the water had gone down, the United States would have lost the gamble and Utah (Voice Overlap).</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.303" offset="6060596">Well Utah -- now, another point on the equity is that Utah has the opportunity of course simply to renounce the Act, not pay for it and then they’ll own it under the doctrine of reliction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.875" offset="6118902">What they’ve contending for here is sort of a both ways test when the water is up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.473" offset="6141262">We feel that they want reliction to apply and when the water is down, they don’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.445" offset="6161115">Another example of this Your Honor, they contend throughout that they have great interest in the lands on the edge, marsh lands and this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.504" offset="6197373">And yet, under their contention, when the water goes up whether above statehood or above the meander line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.886" offset="6222869">We have this controversy that the one it goes above the 1896 levels -- then Utah does not own those edge lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.822" offset="6254634">Utah’s boundary by their contention is exactly fixed and there they are left with an area in the middle of the lake in the upland owners such as the United States and private parties, owned all of those edge lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.041" offset="6303535">And that’s the reason that we believe that here just as in -- as in all of the other cases that have applied reliction that that is the basis for having an ambulatory boundary rather than a fixed boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.490" offset="6349302">We recognize that there are certain problems that an ambulatory boundary causes here, the court noted similar problems in Louisiana versus Texas with a three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.204" offset="6392142">But we would submit and I think this is the basis of all of our arguments that the fixed boundary causes even more problems for periods of decades and even longer, the Utah who is supposed to control the lake would find that large areas of the lake were out of its control and perhaps for equal periods or riparian owner who has an interest in remaining riparian would find the lake to be miles from him and it would remain there for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.851" offset="6502797">This is really the difference between the problems that are caused by the seasonal fluctuations, and the fact that the long run fluctuations of the lake are far greater that you do have the seasonal fluctuation but it will be over here one year and it will stay there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.042" offset="6567581">And then 20 or 30 years later before it may ever come back or it may never come back.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.188" offset="7216149">Well, let me spend just one second at the beginning with respect to the words “such as”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.731" offset="7246346">Utah certainly doesn’t want to be technical with regard to a couple of words as we pointed out in our brief and incidentally, the Tenth Circuit case was decided and this court denied cert two or three weeks ago on that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.401" offset="7300995">But Amoco Oil Company is ready to drill, offshore drilling of the Great Salt Lake now and the army core of engineers has contended that Amoco cannot go ahead pursuant to the authority it has in the State of Utah because under Rivers and Harbors Act they have jurisdiction, they have to apply in that but go through the environmental study etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.517" offset="7393468">Well that hassle never was before the court before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.690" offset="7410082">And the argument made in the Tenth Circuit was this court’s insertion by it’s own initiative of the word “such as” was in adjudication of the regulatory authority of the United States, applied to the Great Salt Lake as a navigable water of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.925" offset="7475075">Now, as our brief points out and I think that the brief is enough of a background and that is why we did not want a couple of innocent looking words to create all kinds of problem that the actual physical administration and management of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.891" offset="7554905">And so, as far as I am concerned on the words “such as” if the government does not insist on putting demand, we would like to have them out and if we can agree on that now, then we’ve agreed on all three changes suggested at the latter part of our brief of the event that the court looks upon Special Master decree as one that might be entered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.438" offset="7653125">This case is rather unusual and that the parties really do not disagree on the legal principles of reliction as maybe stated and as they have developed a common law and as they appear to be reflected in the federal cases that have applied the doctrine and we really don’t defer with respect to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.300" offset="7740583">The real difference is which facts are relevant to this case and whether or not these facts would seem to satisfy the Doctrine of Reliction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.881" offset="7778931">Now, the thing that seem to oppress the Special Master the most, and I think through his discussion, his findings, his conclusions that he mentions more than a dozen time the unique, unusual circumstances of the Great Salt Lake, this simply cause the Doctrine of Reliction not to fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.795" offset="7866598">And the reason for that as the Master points out is this briny residue of the Ancient Lake Bonneville, the Great Salt Lake is in the bottom -- very flat based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.533" offset="7909543">The shores are virtually horizontal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.402" offset="7920933">It has no outlet as most lakes have some kind of tributaries flowing in, in some kind of outlet and they serve to be self regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.467" offset="7957191">The Great Salt Lake isn’t -- you put water in it and it’s like putting water in the glass. The only way it’s going to leave is by evaporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.022" offset="7987493">And because of the very flat shore lands, any water that comes in until it evaporates out, it causes the water to move out almost horizontally and then, as the water evaporates, it moves back in almost horizontally rather than a body of water would if it had reasonably steep shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.980" offset="8079339">And so, because of those very unusual characteristic as the Special Master continue to characterize and is unique, he just could not find on the evidence presented that there had been any gradual imperceptible or reasonably permanent process which had created new uplands as distinguished from the part of the bed of the lake was -- there was subject to inundation from time to time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.293" offset="8320502">Yes, as Mr. Arnold of the United States geological survey explained at some length and I think it summarized to the extent of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.418" offset="8361044">The winds, the temperature or the salinity of the waters, the gradience of the shores, all of these things intermixed because the lake continuously fluctuate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.100" offset="8399809">It’s virtually impossible to have a moment when the total inflow exactly equals total evaporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.992" offset="8431365">You just don’t get that moment in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.664" offset="8442023">And so, however gradually in volume, the lake is either going up or going down and that movement is greatly exaggerated by the relatively flat shore lands -- the extremely flat shore land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.146" offset="8495940">I would like to mention a few of these practical or analytical errors that we think and the Master thought that the government had fallen into and the analysis of its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.099" offset="8551737">When the government said that the only practical argument against the government’s case is if the lands of water covered now that just simply isn’t true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.002" offset="8591339">For one thing, the government chooses to ignore the actual water movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.480" offset="8625298">Here’s a basic hydrograph which appears as the first attachment to the Master’s Report Exhibit P-4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.820" offset="8658631">It shows the basic annual movements of the lake from 1850 to 1973 when the hearings were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.803" offset="8694575">And incidentally when the lake was first viewed in 1850 was the same elevation, almost exactly as it was in 1973, although the variations from year to year and month to month and over the long term are rather remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.996" offset="8759359">But in any event, the government ignores the actual water level or the actual water movement or rate of water movement and computes an average annual stage of the lake by computing the level or stage of the lake, one year as it would compare with the preceding year, which serves to remove the daily, weekly, monthly seasonal fluctuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.768" offset="8874402">Now, the parties agreed that daily, weekly seasonal fluctuation do not result and it changes boundaries by reliction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.535" offset="8901465">But the government then goes to compute the rate of movement of the water by reference to this averages which has nothing at all to do with the actual rate of movement of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.844" offset="8942738">And the government calculates that the water moves at a speed of one-and-a-half inches per hour on the average, all the way around the lake and 15 inches per hour in its most rapid rate of speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.471" offset="9005223">But that just simply isn’t so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.939" offset="9019120">And the government would have to acknowledge that isn’t so as well because they base their calculation not on the water movement itself but upon assumed levels or stages of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.320" offset="9064678">A second analytical error is the governments’ failure to consider in computing its average movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.366" offset="9100831">The Special Master made a special note of this and the pictures throughout the brief, the black and white pictures I think illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.848" offset="9130715">Generally, the lands are very, very leveled but where the mountains come out into the lake, there are variations in the gradient which would have a direct impact on the rate of movement of the water where the land is really flat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.848" offset="9190797">The lake comes up, the water moves over that much more rapidly where a mountain comes down at 45 degree angle into the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.876" offset="9226846">Another error in the governments’ calculation, it based its rapid imperceptible criteria and argument on the 350-mile contour line which is situated within the lands now in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.269" offset="9296436">But that 350-mile line is the surveyed meander line that the parties used as a basis for exchange in a quitclaim deed to illustrate that problem very briefly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.478" offset="9401240">Now, that mathematical calculation might not be terribly serious, the government contends that even if its off 50 miles in the estimate that the rate of movement of the water is still gradual and imperceptible if it can use its averaging technique to compute the rate of movement of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.302" offset="9484622">And let me emphasize in this regard that Judge Fahey, Special Master Fahey was not overly impressed with the rapid actual movement of the water that will move perhaps several inches per second in the flattest area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.544" offset="9553586">His conclusion was while that water movement does not change boundaries, when you’re talking about reliction and the change in boundaries by the doctrine of reliction, you simply cannot ignore the water movements for the purpose of telling where the water is and where it goes and whether or not the shorelands we are talking about have been exposed with some kind of reasonable permanence or some kind of stability so that if you’re going to cause changes in real estate titles you don’t have to do it everyday or every week.</text>

            <text syncTime="2544.582" offset="10281671">As by small and imperceptible degrees, little by little, gradually either deposits would form and form fast land as in accretion where the water would gradually and imperceptibly change so that the stage in the body of water has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.566" offset="10349589">And the annual fluctuations of the lake from its average high water to average high water in the following year would not expose this newly created land or newly exposed land and a new water mark, ordinary high water mark would form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.455" offset="10417194">And then you have land formed either by accretion or reliction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.646" offset="10437987">But the government seems to suggest that it would take the average annual readings of a particular year and having computed that average that that level would then be a sign for January 1 of the following calendar year and that would be the boundary separating the reliction land from the state owned bed of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.463" offset="10533177">Then, there are some suggestion that maybe if you take intermediate readings of periods shorter than a year, I’m holding up what is exhibit -- plaintiff’s exhibit 13 which the Special Master did not attach to his report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.628" offset="10685837">If you take for example the year 1968, then this follows the water level growing to the period of 1968.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.927" offset="10859081">And you will see that if you follow these through from year to year, and every year when the lake is on the rise that it has been in recent years, the governments’ view of the Doctrine of Reliction each January 1, you’re going to be placing the reliction boundary line underneath the water, and it’s going to stay under the water for most of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.780" offset="10930448">And that’s about as diametrically opposed to the common law concept of reliction as it could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.418" offset="10977050">Another practical aspect that isn’t of any great legal consequence is that these lands are no particular value to upland riparian owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.387" offset="11192926">But if the court cares to look at Exhibit P-6 and note the shorelands, immediately upland from the lands that are in dispute, we would see the so called riparian uplands where the claimed riparian uplands that would be claiming the relicted lands in dispute or the lands in dispute that the government claims a reliction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.214" offset="11276204">The only point here as you go through all of these pictures, you will see these flat, mud flats, bogging marsh lands that have no practical value except to the State of Utah in connection with the development of the mineral resources of the lake and other state programs on the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.793" offset="11362513">And the typical case where there would be compelling needs to protect riparian or upland access to the lake or to confer “reliction lands” simply are not present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.679" offset="12238137">But it would be almost an impossible prospect to try to calculate where your boundary was moving with respect to any underground oil pool by having a surface boundary running back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.758" offset="12306369">The State of Utah had control over mineral development there, the state might want to produce oil and gas only during the winter time when the water level was at the highest which would expand the oil pool and then not produce during the summer when the lake would withdraw.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.657" offset="12741987">A question was raised incidentally as to whether or not any other cases -- lake cases have arisen and Mr. Justice White was asking whether Salt Lake might have dried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.741" offset="12786291">When United States against Holt State Bank, Mud Lake did go dry in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.987" offset="12811368">And there, the issue was not one of reliction or accretion -- it was not raised but the title was sustained in the state as against claim from upland patentees of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.181" offset="12940100">I would like to mention before my time is fully at the state law aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.534" offset="12973537">After this court decided Bonelli Cattle Company which incidentally was a year ago to date on December 17 last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.699" offset="13002167">The State of Utah had contended that state law applied since the effect of any decision here would be divesting the State of Utah of land that undeniably was owned by the state through a common law doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.646" offset="13053994">After Bonelli however, the State of Utah advised the Master that in light of Bonelli, we thought that we could not urge the Master to decide this case based on the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.752" offset="13094431">But we left our foot in the door in the event that if for any reason, the Master should decide or this case should decide these unusual and unique features of the Great Salt Lake are reliction lands under federal rules of property law, then this would be an ideal case for borrowing the state law for a purpose of resolving the Great Salt Lake question because the Hardy Salt case made it abundantly clear what the state law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.143" offset="13207907">The State of Utah has managed and administered these lands in disputes in statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.584" offset="13229746">The federal government had winkling that it even wanted to make a claim of these lands until 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.601" offset="13257749">I think it was 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.467" offset="13265272">In any event, the public programs and pursuits and interest of the State of Utah, the state owns a bed of the lake, the minerals and solution -- the minerals under the bed of the lake in part because of the litigation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.170" offset="13328071">And borrowing state law in this case would not necessarily set a (Inaudible) for borrowing state law in other similar cases because of the very unique --</text>

            <label>Mr. Danny Julian Boggs</label>
            <text syncTime="3405.812" offset="13726595">Yes, very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.766" offset="13730461">I would address myself to the question that Utah has raised with regard to the management that they say of these valuable mineral interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.498" offset="13769331">Now, it's interesting that on the one hand, they say that the riparian owners have -- that these lands aren’t very valuable that they have no interest in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.526" offset="13805484">And on the other hand, they wish to continue to own them in an essentially a proprietary capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.714" offset="13830248">We believe that this implicates the doctrine that this court brought up in the Bonelli case which was, in Bonelli, the lands we believe were valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.746" offset="13866402">They were good for recreation, for farming and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.182" offset="13880090">But they were not related to the purposes for which the state had been given the bed of the lake in the first place -- navigation and related purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.017" offset="13911437">So that while Utah has a public interest in the sense that the state would like to own the property generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.063" offset="13935574">Just as in Bonelli, we feel that it does not have the kind of public benefit for navigation and other purposes that would make the Doctrine of Reliction apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.643" offset="13977893">Finally, we would point out that justice in the Tideland case where if oil lies half inside and half outside the three-mile limit there maybe a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.522" offset="14021465">That was exactly the purpose of the Great Salt Lake lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.030" offset="14035466">If Utah accepts the act, then there will be a permanent, fixed boundary hopefully above the level of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.741" offset="14066291">But the fact that there was a problem requiring legislative solution that is Utah run the congress and wanted them to pass an act to keep them from being hurt when the lake declined, does not keep the Doctrine of Reliction from basically being applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.509" offset="14125432">The prettly charge that we have all through here if you took that kind of a daily chart, annually chart, on seasonal and temporary movements, we believe that similar charts could be shown on many other bodies of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.972" offset="14183215">We believe that the basic principles of reliction which apply to give an ambulatory boundary rather than a fixed boundary, should apply here and that the solution is the solution that the congress gave by the passage of the Great Salt Lake lands Act.</text>
