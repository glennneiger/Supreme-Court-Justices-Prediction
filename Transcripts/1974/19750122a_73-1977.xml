            <label>Mr. Robert E. Jordan, III</label>
            <text syncTime="68.411" offset="376978">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.365" offset="392861">This case is here on certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit to review a four to three en banc decision of that circuit awarding attorney's fees to the respondent environmental organizations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.606" offset="445837">It arises out of the Alaska Pipeline litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.234" offset="460257">In order to understand the facts of the attorney's fees case, it's necessary to refer briefly to the underlying litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.265" offset="492440">In mid 1969, affirmance were sought from the Department of Interior to construct the Alaska Pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.304" offset="520547">These applications were subsequently amended in December of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.976" offset="547297">As amended in December of 1969, they reflected the anticipated need at that time of approximately 100 feet in width in order to build this pipeline because of the heavy construction equipment which is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.615" offset="601840">The statute involves the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 provides for a right of way, essentially 50 feet plus the width of the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.227" offset="636322">In this case 54 feet of foot pipeline, Alyeska in its December application sought to acquire additional space under Department of Interior regulations, and they are on the books for some years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Jordan, III</label>
            <text syncTime="149.658" offset="702046">Alyeska is the correct pronunciation, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.883" offset="714898">To acquire this additional space as a special land use permit, there was a provision on Department of Interior regulations for awarding such permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.336" offset="752724">Now, during 1969, and as a chronology set forth in the appendix here which reveals that Department of Interior launched what was at that time really an unprecedented effort to evaluate this pipeline proposal, technically environmentally and what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.201" offset="828165">In January 1, 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act became law and that's commonly referred to these days as NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.747" offset="866408">In March, the respondent's file suit in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.502" offset="881351">They filed suit only against the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.636" offset="893889">And Alyeska our client, the petitioner here and the State of Alaska did not become parties to the litigation until approximately 18 months thereafter when they intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.256" offset="944358">There were two distinct claims in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.169" offset="956061">First of all was that the applicants were limited to 54 feet in width and the Secretary of Interior had no authority to give them more under the special land use permit to regulations or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.484" offset="1005275">Secondly, that the Department of Interior had not yet complied with NEPA which requires federal officials to consider environmental values and to file so-called environmental impact statements for major projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.110" offset="1055848">Preliminary injunction issued in April 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.008" offset="1071417">After that time, the Department of Interior continued to asses the technical and environmental aspects of the pipeline and also began preparing the environmental impact statement required by NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.078" offset="1115721">This statement was issued for public comment in March of 1972 and in May of 1972, Secretary Morton indicated his decision to award the permits including the special land use permits which were challenged by respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.462" offset="1177266">The legal issues involved were then litigated in the District Court in August of 1972 and the respondents were unsuccessful on all issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.119" offset="1211852">The district judge who would enter the preliminary injunction lifted that injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.966" offset="1235257">An appeal then ensued to the District of Columbia Circuit and there the respondents prevailed on the Mineral Leasing Act claim or that part of their claim, that related to the special land use permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.414" offset="1284995">The Court did not decide the NEPA issues which had also been litigated in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.949" offset="1307146">Three of the judges however, expressed a view that those issues ought to be decided and that the secretary's efforts complied with NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.892" offset="1338911">Certiorari was sought to this Court and was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.493" offset="1353331">Thereafter, respondents filed a bill for cost and attorney's fees with the Court of Appeals, sought attorney's fees only against Alyeska, one of the three defendants and sought such fees only for a period beginning approximate to the time of the release of the final environmental impact statement in March '72, did not seek any fees with a period in which the preliminary injunction was sought or obtained.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="336.617" offset="1449880">Did they seek fees just for their services in the Court of Appeals or for throughout the litigation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_jordan_iii" startTime="341.804" stopTime="604.355">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Jordan, III</label>
            <text syncTime="341.804" offset="1470568">Well, it wasn't throughout the litigation but it covered such things for example as obtaining expert comment on the environmental impact statement, they submitted four volumes of comments to the Secretary of Interior as part of the public comments, preparation of the Mineral Leasing Act brief, preparation of the briefs in connection with the NEPA issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.636" offset="1565968">Now, they did not specifically make a claim for the presentation in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.965" offset="1591254">However, the same briefs were used in the Court of Appeals, somewhat unusual procedure but the exact briefs were used in the Court of Appeals, that were used in the District Court so all the work that had been involved in doing the briefs was initially done for the District Court, then used thereafter in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.843" offset="1670771">Meanwhile, Congress had began to consider legislation to solve the problems created by the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.812" offset="1694595">That legislation resulted in public law 93-153 which amended the Mineral Leasing Act and generally with respect to rights of way but it did more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.183" offset="1732106">It contained specific provisions regarding the Alaska Pipeline and it directed issuance of all the necessary permits for the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.262" offset="1768469">Specifically said that there would be no further compliance required with NEPA and this in effect was a rejection of what had been the respondent's principal contention in all of late 1971 and 1972, namely the Secretary of Interior had to consider a comment carter of pipelines through Canada rather than through Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.500" offset="1853419">It also precluded judicial review for -- except for constitutional claims and even for those provided direct appeal from a one-judge district court to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.763" offset="1902425">After this legislation was enacted, the Court of Appeals granted the request for award of attorney's fees against Alyeska.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.800" offset="1930533">The award was based on what we view as a considerably expanded concept of the private attorney general doctrine which some lower courts had embraced.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.636" offset="1965955">And although the majority conceded that Alyeska had not violated any duty, and no duties were imposed on Alyeska by the two statutes which were in question and nonetheless awarded fees against Alyeska.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.261" offset="2020394">This decision is on direct conflict with the Sierra Club versus Lyng the Fifth Circuit which is printed as an appendix to our brief here, certiorari was then granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.447" offset="2073161">Now our principal arguments in seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals decision are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.444" offset="2101164">First, it is our position at the Fifth Circuit held in Sierra Club versus Lyng that it is not equitable to award fees against the party who violated no duty and who could not control the acts of those upon whom the duties were imposed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.070" offset="2175666">Second, the court's unwilling to rule on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.216" offset="2192280">We contend that the Court of Appeals applied an improper concept of the private attorney general doctrine if indeed there is to be a private attorney general doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.494" offset="2229373">Specifically it was wrong to award fees on the Mineral Leasing Act aspects of the case because that width provision on the Mineral Leasing Act was not something which reflected peculiar or unique congressional concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.014" offset="2287470">And secondly, it was wrong to award fees with respect to the NEPA issues on which respondents did not prevail in the District Court, in the Court of Appeals or in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.288" offset="2336475">Now it's our contention that what the Court of Appeals did here is a major extension of the private attorney general doctrine that it will stimulate a greatly increased amount of litigation on the federal courts involving both environmental laws and hundreds of other federal statutory provisions, that there will be collateral litigation concerning the scope of this expanded somewhat indefinite private attorney general exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.335" offset="2448697">And that so unconstrained on exception raises serious questions of legitimate concern to this Court about the proper role of the judiciary, as distinguished from the Congress in saying which federal statutes are so important that attorney's fees ought to be awarded to support their policies.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="604.355" stopTime="612.493">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="604.355" offset="2520795">Is there any case in this Court that is held that there is a general -- private attorney generals?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_jordan_iii" startTime="612.493" stopTime="991.793">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Jordan, III</label>
            <text syncTime="612.493" offset="2553396">There is no such case, there was a reference to the private attorney general doctrine in Newman versus Piggie Park Enterprises but that was a statutory case under Title II of the Civil Rights Act and it was more -- the Court was effectively creating a presumption in favor of attorney's fees on one of the statute there.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.054" offset="2631555">The Court noted last term in the Rich versus United States case that hadn't passed on that private attorney general concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.435" offset="2665096">The Court has noted in various footnotes that other Courts have discussed such a concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.928" offset="2699055">Before, I get to this principal arguments, let me put to rest a couple of matters which were raised by respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.098" offset="2727790">First, respondent seem here to be trying to suggest that Alyeska was guilty in consort with the Secretary of Interior of deliberately lawless conduct and seeking special land used permits as an adjunct to a right of way under the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.579" offset="2789648">This simply cannot be supported, even the majority of the Court of Appeals conceded at the Mineral Leasing Act argument of Alyeska and the secretary was and I quote “manifestly reasonable and assumed in good faith particularly in view of a long administrative practice supporting it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="690.494" offset="2865298">Secondly, the respondents argue that their activities support an award of attorney's fees under a kind of common benefit theory which this Court has approved in cases such as Mills versus Electric Auto-Lite and Hall versus Cole.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.733" offset="2922350">But the Court of Appeals examined that theory too and said in effect that if you're going to apply the common benefit exception of this case, you'd have to take that exception and I quote “stretch it totally outside its basic rationale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="719.025" offset="2979506">The Court also noted that imposing attorney's fees on Alyeska will not operate to spread the cause of litigation proportionally among the beneficiaries, the key requirement of the common benefit theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.462" offset="3029243">And on this regard, the DC circuit has an agreement with the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in Sierra Club versus Lynn.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.869" offset="3062888">Let me turn now to really our principal argument and that is the fact that Alyeska has been held to answer attorney's fees for asserted violations of the duty of the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.884" offset="3118895">The argument is really quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.295" offset="3128508">First, the respondents made two arguments in the litigation earlier that the secretary lacked authority to give permits to Alyeska in connection with the right of way and secondly that the secretary did not adequately comply with his responsibilities under NEPA which requires environmental statements and public comment and circulation among federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.950" offset="3231222">The suit was brought only against the secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.751" offset="3242402">No claim was ever made that Alyeska violated any duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.468" offset="3257240">The Court of Appeals explicitly recognized that the duties were those of the secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.438" offset="3277093">Now despite this, the Court of Appeals went on and awarded the attorney's fees against Alyeska because of its substantial participation under litigation which I cannot deny and because of the massive nature of its interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.691" offset="3334144">In our view, the participation in the litigation and the massivity of Alyeska's interest is simply not the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.894" offset="3366954">The point is as the Fifth Circuit has recognized, Alyeska was innocent of any wrong doing and yet it has been held responsible with regard to attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.670" offset="3422020">Let me turn now if I can to the private attorney general doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.508" offset="3445426">That's the doctrine on which the Court of Appeals rested its decision in this case and plainly did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.732" offset="3470294">Now, we contend that if there's to be a private attorney general doctrine which Mr. Justice Stewart colloquy pointed out, this Court has never really approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.211" offset="3520240">It ought to be confined in some way which makes it manageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.035" offset="3535496">One way to do that would be to confine it to cases involving either constitutional rights or rights which are created by statutes which implement and intend to give substantive rights under constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.863" offset="3594846">And it all further be limited to plaintiffs who prevail in a practical if not a technical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.873" offset="3622849">Let's look into what the Courts have in fact done with the private attorney general exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.366" offset="3644792">The brief of the respondents here footnote 91, sets forth a host of private attorney general cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.415" offset="3677080">There are 28 there where fees were actually awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.378" offset="3692857">When you look at those, you'll find that 26 of them involve either constitutional claims or claims under implementing statutes to constitutional provisions such as 42 U.S.C., Sections 1981, 1982, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.274" offset="3760462">Only one case involves an environmental claim that's the La Raza Unida case in California District Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.982" offset="3791287">And there's another case in California involving an antitrust claim under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.951" offset="3819186">Now, 24 of the plaintiffs in these 28 cases had achieved success on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.532" offset="3853458">And four of the plaintiffs had achieved substantially the same thing in the form of a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.046" offset="3883551">In no case does it appear at least as we can 1547 from the opinions that the fees were awarded against the party without responsibility for our duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.711" offset="3930258">In other words, a party which did not had some violation of a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.072" offset="3951679">Now, with respect to the sort of the important statute argument, the Mineral Leasing Act with provision of the 1920 Act simply cannot qualify as an important statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.851" offset="4010820">The committee reports in connection with the passage of what was then Section 28 of the 1920 Act don't even mention the width limitation nor do committee reports of similar statutes have been kicking around the Congress in 1914 to 1920.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.902" offset="4411016">One way is to say all federal statutes justify attorney's fees awards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.601" offset="5137742">But there's no indication that the organization's involved here or in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.802" offset="5158536">We do think that there's a difficulty with this -- the lack of mutuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.577" offset="5177657">And we basically think that this Court and the lower federal courts ought not to get in the business to try and to pick and choose between statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.865" offset="5214856">If you want to have a private attorney general doctrine that recognizes civil rights and civil rights to derived cases, that possibly is a manageable distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.043" offset="5251532">If you start extending it beyond constitutional rights, it's hard to see where you draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.418" offset="5280998">Let me say, a minute here about the NEPA claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.414" offset="5296985">As to those that simply clear that respondents have not prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.299" offset="5316524">There has been no ruling on NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.033" offset="5327496">The district court judge found for the petitioners, the three judges in the Court of Appeals who expressed an opinion said, “NEPA was satisfied by the secretary and Congress has rejected the NEPA claims.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.596" offset="5373785">Hence it just cannot be a valid private attorney general claim based on the NEPA aspects of the litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.297" offset="5404609">I would point out there that even Congress in passing links such as Title II of the Civil Rights Act with its attorney's fees provisions has made distinctions about prevailing and not prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.196" offset="5444106">The Title II provision requires that the party prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.315" offset="5456645">There are some other federal statutes that do not make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.905" offset="5470960">But even on something as important as the Civil Rights Act, Congress at least as required that the party prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.639" offset="5497919">Now, there are a couple of additional things about the benefits rationale that fit in with the business of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.504" offset="5529370">Let me add a couple of thoughts on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.296" offset="5540551">First of all, most of the specific benefits claimed here are result of the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.426" offset="5569076">Alyeska wasn't a party then, didn't become a party for about another 16 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.254" offset="5592377">And yet perhaps 70% of what's claimed here really relates to the attack on the final environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.836" offset="5622680">Therefore, no relationship between the fees claimed and the benefits claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.948" offset="5643160">And secondly, respondents claim that it's their litigation and their activities which have reduced these various changes in the construction plans for the Pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.006" offset="5687359">This was a great benefit of the country and to Alyeska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.620" offset="5701883">This just isn't supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.103" offset="5711809">And let me take this one example which I pick from the brief of respondents to illustrate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.858" offset="5738768">Talk about buried and elevated pipeline, that's important because in firm or frost soil, if you bury a hot pipeline in the wrong places of the soil, it will fall and it will slump and it may damage the pipeline and could damage the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.244" offset="5796342">Everyone agrees that this is true and you have to be careful about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.107" offset="5811806">But there's no element of the whole pipeline business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.592" offset="5825703">The Department of Interior was more aware of and more concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.402" offset="5840959">That concern goes back to the latter half in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.962" offset="5859244">It antedates NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.394" offset="5864991">It antedates the suit by several months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.419" offset="5877008">In December of 1969, Secretary Heckel wrote to Chairman Jackson of the senate of the interior committee, pointing out that an Interior study had showed there were great problems with these and there were great many unresolved problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.705" offset="5930193">The day before this suit was brought, March 25, 1970, the director of the geological survey who was later to become Undersecretary of Interior had a long involvement with this whole pipeline problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.994" offset="5983378">Sent a memorandum to Secretary Heckel saying, “I've got a studying for my staff people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.070" offset="6007620">This is very troublesome, there are lot of problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.372" offset="6020890">A lot more of the lines are going to half to be buried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.665" offset="6029981">There's no way around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.470" offset="6037295">And yet respondents were trying to claim credit for these and various other things which were the products of the activities of a host of Government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.273" offset="6068433">Now, those things I've just mentioned are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.215" offset="6084211">They are attached to the affidavits that were submitted and on March 30, 1970 the District Court -- those affidavits are referred to in the appendix at page 12 and we're talking about exhibit 19 to the Horton Deposition and exhibit B to the per core deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.636" offset="6157876">We just don't think that the claims of credit can be justified by the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.581" offset="6181700">For these reasons and those set forth in our brief Mr. Chief Justice, we submit that the judgment of District Court circuit should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.370" offset="6740825">Just briefly to go back a little bit, the oil companies that Mr. Jordan represents discovered and got rights to this vast amount of oil on the north slope of Alaska.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.518" offset="6873422">That was their decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.904" offset="6899022">They then set it out determining how they would go about getting permission to do that since most of the lands that would be crossed will be federal lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.913" offset="7183026">It went pass through 200 years of history of Internal Interior Department Regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.233" offset="7236315">And I think we had to more or less do the same thing to show not only did it say what it said on its face but it meant that -- I think the Court of Appeals in its opinion indicated why we had to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.828" offset="7278634">Judge Wright, after saying that the statute was as clear as it could be said, but, it may well be that 50 feet couldn't have meant 50 feet and we will go beyond and the Court went beyond all of the other factors that looked to the Interior Department of Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.629" offset="7345925">Indeed, Your Honor it found that on the face of the regulations, not only on the face of the statute, the kinds of permits contemplated here were banned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.862" offset="7382810">It found no long standing administrative practice and we anticipated and it happened that the oil companies with their resources joined up with the Government, calling the field offices of the Interior Department around the country looking for any shred of evidence that might give them an indication that this was a long standing practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.963" offset="7463267">There was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.345" offset="7468701">When the record finally came down after these three years, Mr. Jordan and his -- and the Government came up with actually five documented instances of this kind of permit that they claim constitute a long standing practice and none of them before 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.178" offset="7540067">And I think the total miles involved were around 50 or 60-mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.310" offset="7560652">But for some reason, the oil companies did not want to go to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.967" offset="7579251">At any time in the three years of this litigation was filed, the oil companies were free to go to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.742" offset="7602343">No one stopped them from doing it and in fact the theme of wilderness society, one is that this was a prescription that was directed to the oil industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.447" offset="7641109">And Congress specifically said if the oil industry wants more land and should come back to us and tell us why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.193" offset="7668172">And Alyeska was not compelled to go to the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.356" offset="7684786">It could have read as we read the preliminary injunction in 1970, and at that point gone to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.351" offset="7708818">It could have gone to Congress at anytime and therefore this litigation certainly didn't burden the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.331" offset="7736717">The only people that really burdened the Courts were Alyeska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.568" offset="7749674">They were the ones who insisted on litigating this all the way through right up to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.406" offset="7769004">This Court I may note denied certiorari the first time around four days after receiving our opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.301" offset="7800560">And yet the litigation was long and prolonged because of Alyeska's decision, not ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.691" offset="7822085">And the real issue here is who should bear the economic burden of compelling Alyeska and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.490" offset="7873285">And the question really is one between Alyeska and Exxon and Arco and Amerada Hess on one side and the Wilderness Society and the Environmental Defense Fund and the Friends of the Earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.852" offset="7926784">And who between those two should be compelled to their at least part of the economic burden of this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.559" offset="8225625">In fact I think the clear purport of the statutory scheme was for Mr. Jordan and his client to go to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.485" offset="8257285">We don't really think that the question of technical legal liability is a sine qua non fully award in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.253" offset="8288423">And it certainly was not the basis on which the Court of Appeals proceeded and we think correctly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.106" offset="8311829">But even on that point, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 has a clear forfeiture provision which in a very real sense put a direct legal liability on Mr. Jordan and his clients.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.744" offset="8502314">I think even here though it is important to focus on something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.904" offset="8514957">Mr. Jordan indicates that the NEPA issues insofar as they were litigated really were irrelevant that we didn't prevail -- admittedly we didn't prevail because we prevailed on a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.821" offset="8566680">But again the Wilderness Society and the groups I represented, when the secretary announced in May of 1972 that he was going to go ahead and issue permits not withstanding the preliminary injunction and not withstanding the limitation of the Mineral Leasing Act, we immediately filed a motion for partial summary judgment solely under Mineral Leasing Act ground which was the earliest time we could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.521" offset="8669497">We said, “We believe this is dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.601" offset="8681827">We request the Court to rule on it promptly that Alyeska and the Government had three years now to figure out why 50 feet doesn't mean 50 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.716" offset="8718190">And we are satisfied to go on that issue alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.928" offset="8731042">Alyeska, which by this time had intervened and as Mr. Jordan has indicated very vigorously intervened have filed a motion the next day and argued, “No!</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.839" offset="8770748">Don't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.438" offset="8777122">Require the Wilderness Society, Environmental Defense fund to litigate all the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.430" offset="8797080">Require them to litigate the NEPA issues as well.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.651" offset="8809932">And specifically Mr. Jordan said, not the Government, not the State of Alaska but Mr. Jordan and his papers that unless the NEPA issues are briefed and argued, the Court will not have a basis for determining even the Mineral Leasing Act issues, that you cannot determine the Mineral Leasing Act issues in the abstract, you need to get the whole technical background and development of this entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.072" offset="8923617">And he submitted, “When you have that and when you tell the Wilderness Society to submit a NEPA brief, we are then convinced that you will rule out their arguments on the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.471" offset="8969279">And so even on that issue, we were told to litigate at Mr. Jordan's insistence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.137" offset="8991953">Now, Mr. Jordan says that we did not prevail on the NEPA issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.006" offset="9007417">We didn't prevail under NEPA issues for precisely the reason that we have suggested to the Court that if the Mineral Leasing Act were indeed a threshold bar, the Court would be in a sense giving an abstract opinion on an issue of no significance because Congress would have the final determination and that's what ultimately happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.014" offset="9083382">I might say that there are questions raised frequently about delays and whether the environmentalist caused delays in the Alaska Pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.990" offset="9123297">But the record indicates that the environmentalists are responsible for none or hardly any delay that the initial suit was filed in the beginning of 1970, the earliest possible time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.685" offset="9170108">The oil companies and the secretary will put on notice that both the Mineral Leasing Act and NEPA impose some fairly serious obligations on them that they ought to adhere to before going ahead with this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.008" offset="9223398">Mr. Jordan skips from 1970 to 1972 but there was a significant series of events that occurred in early 1971 when the Interior Department published a draft impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.307" offset="9276583">In January of 1971, the thought there was that that would serve as a basis to go ahead on the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.929" offset="9307094">And that there might be some fixing up of the statement as a result of comments but by March or so of 1971, there'd be a go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.756" offset="9342412">That statement was given by the Interior Department to Mr. Jordan's clients prior to its publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.045" offset="9371564">Many of the comments about the impact of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were softened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.661" offset="9406046">There was tremendous criticism of that impact statement as a result by our organizations, by other federal government agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.605" offset="9441782">And as a result, it was not really until February of 1971 that the Interior Department and I submit Mr. Jordan's clients got down to the serious business of grappling with the real complexities of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.225" offset="9504266">So, really a whole year was lost from March of 1970 to around February of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.782" offset="9534464">And it's a year for which these respondents are in no way responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.847" offset="9550764">And then from 1971 as I indicated till 1972, there was the work being done on the environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.155" offset="9583992">We don't claim that credit for the good things that came and there are a lot of good things that came through that effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.416" offset="9613040">In the course of this litigation, we'd oppose the individual who was placed in charge of the drafting effort by the Secretary of Interior, a geologist named Dr. David Brew and I have never found a medic, find a public servant and a more dedicated man in my life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.158" offset="9676048">And he received accolades from us as well as well as from Mr. Jordan's clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.186" offset="9692139">We had some problems with the work that was completed but there couldn't have been a man who worked harder or who had the public interest more at heart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.793" offset="9730591">But then when that impact statement was issued as I have indicated while we presented our views to the secretary about what we thought still was wrong with it, we were perfectly willing for the litigation to end at that point, if a Congress to do its job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.614" offset="9789837">We submitted the papers but the oil companies wanted to keep the case in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.937" offset="9811153">Ultimately, we prevailed under Mineral Leasing Act issue and Mr. Jordan says in his brief and says today but it was on a technical issue that was of no importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.814" offset="9854621">What difference this 50 feet mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.364" offset="9864861">Well I think the subsequent history of anything demonstrates what the importance of it was, Congress didn't say “My God 50 feet is absurd, we don't care, take a hundred, take a thousand, just build this thing and get the oil down”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.463" offset="9921181">There are 10 months of debate and with all of the pressures that were replaced and realistic ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.319" offset="9944691">All of the knowledge of the impending energy problems, the decision to build the Trans-Alaska Pipeline without further litigation passed by the senate by a 49-49 vote with Vice President Agnew breaking the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.011" offset="10007385">And it passed in the house by a vote of 221 to 198 and even then the proponents of that legislation, it certainly was unusual legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.904" offset="10055032">But even then they said that the delays that have already occurred as a result of this litigation which permitted the interior department and Alyeska finally to get down to work and do what they should have down all along, convinces us that now we can go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.472" offset="10125249">So I don't take the subsequent legislation that came out of the Congress as a defeat for the environmental groups that is precisely what they had been asking for all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.905" offset="10171016">They had been asking that there be a real and considered judgment of what the implications of this project were and we got that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.416" offset="10205080">And they were asking that the matter be referred to Congress, as Congress has indicated it wished in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, we got that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.339" offset="10240711">And there's been no further dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.004" offset="10247398">The pipeline is being built.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.339" offset="10256697">We wish the oil companies well and we do hope that it will be done in an environmentally responsible manner and presumed that it will.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.304" offset="10344573">What the oil companies essentially went into the Interior Department with, was a map and a line of where they plan to go and essentially what they said was that “we'll get out in the field and out in the field we will be able to make adjustments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.007" offset="10399431">But the principle differences were number one, that all of the river crossings were to be buried and that would have had tremendous erosion problems and there would have been significant ruptures along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.295" offset="10456586">All of the overland portion with the exception about 5% was too be buried and now it was more -- was to be buried, now about 55% or so will be elevated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.825" offset="10502666">There was very little understanding of the topography along the root of potential landslides and avalanches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.926" offset="10535058">And of course the most significant problem and one that by the way remains a problems one that concerns everyone still greatly including, I'm sure the oil companies is that the southern two thirds of the Alaska Pipeline route is seismically about the most active area in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.085" offset="10599737">In fact the southern terminus, Valdez, was destroyed in 1964 by a major earthquake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.498" offset="10629413">The Interior Department's impact statement indicates that there will be a major earthquake along the pipeline route sometime during its life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.215" offset="10672253">Now the time that has gone by has at least permitted Alyeska to prepare contingency plans and certain defenses in areas where they know there are potentially active faults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.990" offset="10739336">The most obvious one is it (Inaudible) which everyone has been aware of for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.578" offset="10753651">The frightening thing though is that the Interior Department statement indicates that there maybe other potentially seismic active falls all along the route that cannot be predicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.870" offset="10802866">So we maybe and for some very serious problems in the years ahead, if one of those should become active and by the way even with all the study, the conclusion is that if there is a major rupture, there will be a minimum of about 60,000 barrels of oil that will spill into the lakes and the streams before preventive measures can be taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="2738.738" offset="11058343">And it's still an amazingly complex project and one that is going to take all of the efforts of Mr. Jordan's clients to cope with and we sincerely hope that we'll be able to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.506" offset="11101393">I think another problem which I might mention is the -- well it's called the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and that certainly is what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.983" offset="11135352">Once it makes it through, if I could just have a minute, ones the pipeline makes it through the entire root, the problems really only begin because then it has to be loaded on to these major super tankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.916" offset="11183000">And again the final impact statement says that -- and this is now when all the study is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.081" offset="11207659">That in the average of the pipeline, we can expect a 140 barrels of oil to pollute the northeast pacific which is the vast but really major unpolluted ocean area in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.315" offset="11264606">And that's only an average figure, one super tanker crash will spill a million barrels.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.062" offset="11407653">Nor, does it really seem to be arguing that the factors cited by the Court as applied to this case do not justify or do not support the award of fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.910" offset="11454986">And what really appears to be the principal argument, it certainly seems to true in the brief and I think it was the thrust of the argument today, was that somehow, this decision to award fees in this case is allowed to stand, the lower courts will be set off in all sorts of directions issuing all sorts of unpredictable opinions awarding fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.132" offset="11543907">And I respectfully suggest that the lower courts are entitled to a little more confidence than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.018" offset="11571493">Indeed a hundred years ago when this Court first extended and recognized the validity of an awarded fees in the common fund cases in the Trustees v.

            <text syncTime="2983.596" offset="12037726">But I think that the same considerations really that gave rise to the award in Greenough apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.930" offset="12059042">Really what the Court was saying, is it fair in a circumstance as such as that when one individual has really had to take the burden of a litigation that goes far beyond any interest of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.857" offset="12110764">Is it fair for that individual to bear the full burden of the litigation when there is an equitable mechanism available for spreading the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.737" offset="12150366">And I believe that's exactly the same factor that the Court of Appeals below recognized in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.305" offset="12176593">And I think the Court of Appeals recognized and I think the record here demonstrates amply that this is a unique case, this is a truly extraordinary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.767" offset="12214418">The issues were extremely complex, the litigating burden that the respondents for no economic benefits had to assume was immense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.613" offset="12249840">And that the results of the litigation were beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.474" offset="12265305">And they were not a benefit that in anyway adhere to the economic gain of the respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3057.719" offset="12334268">A just respect for the eminent judges under whose direction, many of these cases have been administered would lead to the conclusion that allowances of this kind if made with moderation and a jealous regard to the rights of those who are interested are not only admissible but agreeable to the principles of equity and justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.248" offset="12416397">And I submit that that is precisely what happened in this case and that the Court with the greatest familiarity of this record and the Court which struggled with this case over period of five months in reaching that the decision in Wilderness Society want was it correct in ruling that this wasn't appropriate case for an award of fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3746.020" offset="15087470">Let's say any trust or other the enforcement in some economic area and the Government then sought fees from the losing party and made the claim that generally known in the profession of lawyers in the Department of Justice are working for less than they could get outside and therefore the difference should go under the Government's covers, but has any Court ever allowed the government that kind of cost of litigation?</text>

            <text syncTime="3776.911" offset="15210977">No but I think the Government is the attorney general and I think that it's generally understood that the when the Government brings litigation of course, and we're talking about really a solid base, their taxes which are going to support the Government lawyers, their pension funds, there's a hospitalization, there's retirement of a very different situation for a lawyer even though obviously lawyers and career lawyers are making sacrifices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.099" offset="15315780">There are very different situation from a private lawyer who was really moving into the place of the Government for one reason or another who was then shouldering the burden and I think that this is -- this decision in this particular case is designed to lighten effort.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Jordan, III</label>
            <text syncTime="3826.031" offset="15407522">A few further observations Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.753" offset="15422360">It seems to be difficult to persuade Mr. Flannery of our good faith but I hope I'll do a better job with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.326" offset="15460707">The Court of Appeals said that our position was taken in good faith in view of the law in administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.387" offset="15484949">I would just like to point out a few additional things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.129" offset="15499891">The practice of special land use permits was supported by opinions of the Attorney General going back in to the 1870's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.993" offset="15531342">Department of Interior had regulations on special land use permits for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.239" offset="15552345">Perhaps most significant, in 1923, three years after the Mineral Leasing Act was enacted, there began a practice of giving in fact more land and the statute literally allowed for the purpose of pumping stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.000" offset="15615352">But that have been done for approximately 50 years when this litigation came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.227" offset="15636250">That had been codified in the Interior Regulations and it been expanded to include not only pumping stations but other necessary facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.888" offset="15674911">Now that's an element of our good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.168" offset="15692048">I would also point out that the Court of Appeals accepted this argument with respect to pumping stations and rejected the argument of the respondents on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.669" offset="15730082">And finally I would say that in 1970, the Ninth Circuit had decided a case Sierra Club versus Hickel 433 fd 2d. 24 which was subsequently before this Court on the name of Sierra Club versus Morton on the basis of standing issue and resolved on the basis of standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.474" offset="15817226">The Ninth Circuit had allowed as an alternative holding the Department of Agriculture to tack if you will special land used permits onto a specific acreage limitation for recreation developments on the Mineral King development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.814" offset="15886608">Now Mr. Justice Blackmun had something to say about that when the case was up before this Court but the point was that 1970 is relevant time, we were relying on that kind of opinion from the Ninth Circuit on a very closely related point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.939" offset="15955153">Other discussions here about relative portions of the fees for various activities, like to just reemphasize the point I made in my principal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.037" offset="15999561">The benefit which Mr. Flannery claims were benefits of the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.516" offset="16021400">Now presumably, no fees were sought for that because there was no deep pocket there to go after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.440" offset="16049089">Alyeska was not applied to the litigation of the time the preliminary injunction did not become so for many months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.851" offset="16082735">But most of the fees claim and certainly the fees claimed relating to the NEPA issues are of a nature having nothing to do with the benefits involving changing the pipe line construction that had already taken place largely by March of 1972 when the final environmental statement came up and most of that related the Trans Canadian alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.147" offset="16183986">Now the District Court, the transcript of August 14, 15, 1972 when these issues were argued, just before lunch one of those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.876" offset="16222856">Judge Hart asked the respondents here, what do you really want?</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.890" offset="16242918">What is it you want this Court to do in a way of an order?</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.456" offset="16257233">Come back after lunch and tell me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.339" offset="16268727">And that's the transcript of that proceeding which is referred to in appendix at 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.465" offset="16305194">After lunch, respondents came back and said “what we really want here is an addendum to the final environmental impact statement dealing with these common carter pipeline arrangements through Canada and Alaska.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.534" offset="16361514">That's what the whole NEPA exercise was about, that's what respondents were seeking at that time and it has nothing absolutely nothing to do with bringing about changes in the construction of the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.247" offset="16416371">One more point, with respect to who brought about these changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.146" offset="16439986">The record is not very satisfactory on this and the reason of course is that thing was initially determined by the Court of Appeals in the first instance, was not before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.912" offset="16479065">And the record that we have here was not designed to shed light on the attorney's fees issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.384" offset="16504874">But if you were to go back to the record, you would find document after document after document that supports the notion that people like Oscar Furrence (ph) and Reuben catch a door and of the geological survey where the people who brought about the changes on burying an elevation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.712" offset="16578226">Bob Page of the geological survey was a fellow who was in there saying time after time again you got a more closely examined the seismic, the earthquake problem and there's example after example that that could be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.772" offset="16634441">So the idea that there is a great contribution here is really one of the self congratulation I think and would not be supported on my detailed examination on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.231" offset="16692328">With respect to the powers of equity, we're not challenged about the power of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.216" offset="16716257">We're not talking about power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.453" offset="16725138">We're talking about wisdom here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.638" offset="16733915">How should the equity power be exercised?</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.038" offset="16747499">We say it should not be exercised against the party who was guilty of no wrong doing and we say further that it should not be exercised to create the kind of open ended private attorney General exception which is reflected in the Court of Appeals opinion.</text>
