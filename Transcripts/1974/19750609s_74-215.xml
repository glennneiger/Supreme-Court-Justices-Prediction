            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">I have the judgment and opinion to announce in 74-215, United States against Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.269" offset="29048">For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="16.423" offset="65620">I have filed a dissenting opinion in this case in which Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Powell have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.756" offset="102922">This case involves the criminal conviction of the respondent, John R. Park for violating the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.663" offset="142629">The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of conviction finding that as instructed by the trial judge, the members of the jury were given no objective standards by which to determine whether Park was guilty or innocent and indeed that the jury were allowed to convict Park even if they found no wrongdoing on his part of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.621" offset="238446">Today the Court reverses the Court of Appeals and reinstates Park's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.260" offset="268957">Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Powell and I, agree with the Court of Appeals that this criminal conviction was totally invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.873" offset="319425">The instructions given by the trial judge in this case were a virtual nullity, a mere authorization to convict if the jury thought it appropriate to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.869" offset="371461">Instructions of -- like that regardless of the blame worthiness of the defendant's conduct, regardless of the social value of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and regardless of the importance of convicting those who violate that Act have no place in our jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.730" offset="454844">A fundamental principle of our law is that a jury is to decide the facts and apply to them the law as explained by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.878" offset="507507">Were it otherwise trial by a jury would be no more rational and no more responsive to the accumulated wisdom of the law than trial by ordeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.210" offset="552751">It is the function of jury instructions in short to establish in any trial the objective standards that a jury is to apply as it performs its own function of finding the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.193" offset="612728">We deal here with a criminal conviction, not a civil forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.959" offset="635820">It is true that the crime was but a misdemeanor and the penalty in this case light.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.136" offset="664451">But under the statute, even a first conviction can result in imprisonment for a year, and a subsequent offense is a felony carrying a punishment of up to three years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.520" offset="713979">So the standardless conviction approved today can serve in another case tomorrow to support a felony conviction and a substantial prison sentence however highly the Court may regard the social objectives of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, that regard cannot serve to justify a criminal conviction so wholly alien to fundamental principles of our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.533" offset="838113">Before a person can be convicted of a criminal violation of this Act, a jury must find, and must be clearly instructed that it must find, evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he engaged in wrongful conduct amounting at least to common-law negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.951" offset="919719">There were no such instructions, and clearly, therefore, no such finding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.709" offset="946782">For the reasons set out in more detail in a written opinion filed with the clerk today, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice Powell, and I, respectfully dissent from the opinion and judgment of the Court.</text>
