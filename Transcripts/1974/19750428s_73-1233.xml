            <text syncTime="17.266" offset="68963">The issue in the Sears case, 73-1233 is whether the Freedom of Information Act requires a disclosure upon request of certain documents known as Advice and Appeals Memoranda generated by the office of General Counsels of the National Labor Relations Board in the course of deciding whether or not to permit the filing with the Board of an unfair labor practice complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.646" offset="166557">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the disclosure was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.011" offset="187977">We affirm insofar as the documents conclude that a complaint should not be filed but reversed where the conclusion is that the complaint should issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.362" offset="221414">Our reasons for these conclusions are given in an opinion on file with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.017" offset="243984">The Chief Justice concurs in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.311" offset="253179">Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
