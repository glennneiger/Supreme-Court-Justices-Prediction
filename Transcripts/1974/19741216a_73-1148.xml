            <label>Mr. Bertram E. Hirsch</label>
            <text syncTime="51.035" offset="307493">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.194" offset="320136">This case is here on a a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.628" offset="345840">The issue presented is whether the Act of March 3, 1891 opening for a non-Indian settlement, the un-allotted and unreserved lands in the Lake Traverse Reservation, thereby, confer jurisdiction over Indians on the State of South Dakota, gave the State of South Dakota jurisdiction over Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.130" offset="451897">Since the State of South Dakota has never acquired jurisdiction in Indian country pursuant to either the 1953 Act of Congress Public Law, 280, which was mentioned here earlier or under the more recent Indian Civil Rights Act, the Act of April 11, 1968, the issue here really is whether the 1891 Act in any way changed the boundaries of the Lake Traverse Reservation, whether or not the open portions of the reservation are still an Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.688" offset="594108">The facts of the case are really rather simple, with regard to Mrs. DeCoteau and her two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.578" offset="625664">In December of 1971, the State of South Dakota started dependency and neglect proceedings against Mrs. DeCoteau, the aim of which was to terminate her parental rights to her two children Herbert John Spider and Robert Lee Feather.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.365" offset="692851">The state was seeking authority to place those children for adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.046" offset="715525">In August of 1972, the District County Court, before which this dependency and neglect proceeding was pending, issued a custody order that continued a foster care placement for Herbert John Spider and validated a foster care placement that was then in existence for Robert Lee Feather.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.783" offset="814477">At that time, a motion was made to the District County Court Judge that the case be dismissed for the sole reason that the acts or many of the acts where the alleged dependency and neglect occurred, the places where the acts occurred were in the open portions of the reservation.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="199.761" offset="902457">Mr. Hirsch enlighten me, why is that particularly relevant?</text>
            <text syncTime="204.121" offset="919907">I had thought that domicile in an adaption case was the standard, not where the acts occurred.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bertram E. Hirsch</label>
            <text syncTime="212.398" offset="952926">Well, this case never reached the point of adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.545" offset="965569">In fact, the argument on the merits of whether or not there was, in fact, a dependency or neglect situation had never been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.853" offset="1002768">There was never an adjudication of dependency and neglect, it was in the midst of that proceeding on the merits that the jurisdictional objection was raised.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="232.944" offset="1035160">I would still ask, why is the place where the acts took place pertinent?</text>

            <label>Mr. Bertram E. Hirsch</label>
            <text syncTime="241.423" offset="1069014">Well, it's pertinent in terms of whether we are talking here about state jurisdiction over the Indian mother and her two children or whether we are talking about exclusive tribal jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="256.478" stopTime="259.987">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="256.478" offset="1129305">Incidentally, does the record show where she was domiciled?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bertram_e_hirsch" startTime="259.987" stopTime="356.792">
            <label>Mr. Bertram E. Hirsch</label>
            <text syncTime="259.987" offset="1143306">The record does not show where she was domiciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.557" offset="1157622">The record shows that she is an enrolled member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux tribe that her two children are enrolled members and that it was stipulated in the circuit court habeas corpus proceeding that 50% of the acts giving rise to the dependency and neglect proceeding occurred on federal trust lands and approximately 50% occurred on lands that were open to settlement under the 1891 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.436" offset="1269112">But, I might add, that that stipulation was made solely for the purpose of the habeas corpus proceeding in the circuit court and does not necessarily a statement by which I would be bound if we had to proceed once again on the merits in the District County Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.872" offset="1338911">The District County Court denied the motion and Ms. DeCoteau then proceeded by way of habeas corpus in the District County Court -- in the circuit court, alleging the exclusive ground of lack of jurisdiction in the District County Court to proceed with the dependency and neglect proceeding and to issue orders regarding the custody of her two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.341" offset="1424697">The circuit court found that the areas of land that were open to settlement by the 1891 Act were no longer part of the reservation, were no longer Indian country and that therefore the State district court had jurisdiction to issue the custody orders pertaining to these two children and had jurisdiction to entertain the dependency and neglect proceeding.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="373.487" offset="1597315">And was there an appeal from the district court to the circuit court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bertram_e_hirsch" startTime="378.159" stopTime="649.859">
            <label>Mr. Bertram E. Hirsch</label>
            <text syncTime="378.159" offset="1616018">I believe that it is possible to appeal from the district court to the circuit court, but the statutes also allow in some instances for a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.600" offset="1657814">But, we didn't choose to follow that route.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.346" offset="1668786">We started a collateral attack on the district court proceeding by a proceeding in circuit court with a habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.764" offset="1706402">So, we never did finish the trial on the merits of the dependency and neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.125" offset="1731897">That case, in fact, is pending resolution of this jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.829" offset="1758647">There was state pending resolution of this jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.889" offset="1774947">The Supreme Court of South Dakota needless to say affirmed the circuit court and held that the lands that were open for non-Indian settlement under the 1891 Act, were no longer part of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.353" offset="1860733">The place to start, I believe, with this case is with the treaty that established the Lake Traverse Reservation, that treaty is the treaty of February 19, 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.663" offset="1914023">And in Article 3 of that treaty, the Congress ratified an agreement with the tribe that gave the tribe a very clearly defined reservation and it described the reservation in the treaty as a permanent reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.923" offset="1987062">The reservations located in the North East corner of South Dakota with a small portion of it in the South East corner of the North Dakota, it's triangular in shape, basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.515" offset="2033455">Article 10 of the same 1867 Treaty, reserved to the tribal chiefs and headmen, the right to make rules and regulations for the security and safety of tribal members, the right basically to tribal self government.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.096" offset="2111718">There were -- from 1867 until 1891 there were no acts or any agreements with the tribe that pertained to the boundaries of this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.780" offset="2154454">And then in 1891, after negotiating an agreement with the tribe, Congress ratified the agreement that open for settlement, the surplus lands on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.703" offset="2214222">Now, the surplus lands are the lands that remain after allotment and after various other reservations are made, for example, for schools, religious purposes, for the BIA agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.171" offset="2272005">It was -- it's not the BIA agency in those days, but the equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.026" offset="2295515">After 1891, it's agreed between the parties, I believe, that there is no other act that could have reduced the Lake Traverse Reservation in size or disestablished the open portions of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.805" offset="2362598">So, what we're talking about is, whether or not the 1891 Act had that effect, we, of course, maintain that it did not and I'd like to start by going into the expressed language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.589" offset="2417768">This Court in Mattz against Arnett at 412 U.S. has held that the test is whether -- the test for termination of reservation or for disestablishment of any portion of it, is whether the language of the act expressly terminates the reservation or whether such termination can be inferred from a clear legislative history or surrounding circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.072" offset="2527692">The only two sections in the 1891 Act that are at all pertinent to the issues here at Sections 26 and Section 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.362" offset="2568861">Now, Section 26 is, basically, a straightforward verbatim transcription or rendition of the agreement that was reached with the tribe in 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.546" offset="2629569">One of the -- Article 1 of that agreement, which is repeated in Section 26 of the Act, says that the tribe cedes, sells, relinquishes and conveys its title to the surplus lands, to the United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="649.859" offset="2702817">That's a pretty strong language, isn't it?</text>

          <turn speaker="bertram_e_hirsch" startTime="652.497" stopTime="763.090">

            <text syncTime="652.497" offset="2713370">It is, Your Honor, but I think that we have to understand what the rest of that section says and read that in context and I'm going to do that in a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.099" offset="2763734">And I think we'll see that the language is much less strong than it would on the face appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.694" offset="2794141">Section 30 of the Act, which is the only other act affecting the issues here, says that the lands that are ceded and sold and relinquished and conveyed shall be opened for settlement under the homestead and townsite laws of the United States, except for land Section 16 and 36, which are reserved for school purposes and made subject to the laws of the state wherein located.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.652" offset="2905945">Now, the important thing to answer your question Mr. Justice Blackmun about Section 26 and the session language is that in Section 26, the section recites Section 5 of the General Allotment Act and it says that this entire agreement is entered into under the General Allotment Act and this Court in Mattz v. Arnett gave a very, very careful analysis of the General Allotment Act and concluded at 412 U.S. Page 496 that -- and I'm quoting that the General Allotment Act permitted the President to make allotments of reservation lands to resident Indians and with tribal consent, to sell surplus lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.552" offset="3105625">Its policy was to continue the reservation system and the trust status of Indian lands, but to allot tracks to individual Indians for agriculture and grazing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.529" offset="7301517">And if in fact, the tribe has been given authority by Congress, which it has been this year, to consolidate its land holdings if it wanted to consolidate the land holdings in the Southern tip of the reservation with those to the north, it would have to buy a considerable portion of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.994" offset="7379362">I think it's clear from the legislative history of these acts which refer to the reservation as a V-shaped reservation located in the North-East in corner of South Dakota and the South-East in corner of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.245" offset="7436309">It's clear that Congress in 1974 in passing these laws thought that the reservation continued to exist in the way it was established in 1867.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.336" offset="8020720">I would like to show the court the position of the State of South Dakota on this map that is part of the government’s amicus brief and the back of it, and we can kind of -- we had the Colville case's warning in the north half of the Colville Reservation was ceded or it was restored to the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.594" offset="8121762">Now, in 1887, they started the General Allotment Act and Senator Dawes started that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.123" offset="8159901">And that let the Secretary of the Interior whenever he thought it for the best interest of the Indians and there were surplus land to allot these Indians or not allot them as he saw it fit, and sell off whatever portion of their surplus reservation that they wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.190" offset="8240149">So if the north half, for example of the Colville Reservation was ceded, that would leave and did leave the south half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.468" offset="8273272">The north half boundaries would be no more because when they ceded it, they would necessarily by metes and bounds or something strike a line across where it was ceded and the north half was no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.330" offset="8328652">Now this is in effect, what happened in the Sisseton-Wahpeton Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.820" offset="8354670">The Secretary of Interior acquainted to Commission to go out and treat with these Indians for the sell of their land, and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.521" offset="8389465">And under the agreement and the wording of the 1889 and 1891 Act, they ceded, sold, relinquished, and conveyed all interest in all of their lands that had been -– except the ones that had been allotted or were going to be alloted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.964" offset="8511195">So in effect, what that did if we can show this court that the cede is strong enough and the words are strong enough in the legislative history, that wiped out the boundaries of this reservation and left the allotments sitting there on the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.969" offset="8599280">Now this gets into further -- our position of the state as to what is Indian country, and in 1948, they defined by statute Indian country, 1151(a) and for our purposes 1151(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.505" offset="8665422">Now 1151(a) defined Indian country is all land within an Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States except notwithstanding patents and , including rights-of-way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.894" offset="12230928">Senator Dawes prior to the time, the bill passed made the statement that all 7 or 8 million of acres of land going in there that day was going to be restored to the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.237" offset="12288293">The Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1890 prior to the passage of this bill said this land is going to be restored to the public domain and specifically mentioned Sisseton and Wahpeton, 660 thousand acres roughly and I imagine the reason he mentioned it because it was sold for $2.50 an acre and rest was $1.50 an acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.130" offset="12375855">The Department of Interior Reports also confirm this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.945" offset="12403127">From that time on, from 1892 the official maps of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for several years wiped it off.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.158" offset="12536038">I think a map that you have up here today that I thought I saw, shows the Indian reservation day as the original Sisseton and Wahpeton Indian reservation as it was back in 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.333" offset="12592671">And I am suggesting Your Honors that in order to determine congregational intent or legislative history, all that is needed to be done in this case is to go back to the act, prior to the act, after the act look at what Senator Dawes says who was primarily responsible for the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.091" offset="15135744">The law or the case law that really developed on the Sisseton and Wahpeton, an Indian reservation were four DeMarrias, Indian cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.631" offset="15189870">Two of them were in the Supreme Court of -- I believe the Supreme Court of South Dakota and second one of those cases, this court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.266" offset="15240443">The first two cases, all decided that the Sisseton and Wahpeton land area had been ceded by the Act of 1891.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.264" offset="15292479">The federal district court, Judge Beck also held that and this case came into the circuit court of appeals, either argued at St. Paul or St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.524" offset="15349426">In 1963, the circuit court of appeals of St. Louis upheld this very action and said that the lands had been ceded and this was not Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.125" offset="15423822">In 1963, if I have my date correct, the Justice Department of the United States also argued that the land, the reservation had been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.997" offset="15495398">In 1973, they've had a change of policy and they argued that the reservation was there according to the boundaries back in 1867, and so the circuit court of appeals overruled along line of cases, in fact, overruled themselves on this area in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.364" offset="15616815">Our argument, our main thrust of why they did it is that they blanketly applied Mattz, Seymour, the Newtown's decisions to this reservation, former reservation, it gets confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.437" offset="15701138">Our argument, simply, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.271" offset="15716498">The Mattz cases and the Seymour case and this case, can easily be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.991" offset="15743352">We are not asking this court to overrule your case of Mattz or your case of Seymour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.092" offset="15775744">Those cases, evidently were decided on the rule set up by this court and for example, in Mattz, they tried to open that reservation for a long time and couldn't get the job done and your rulings were right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.055" offset="15831542">But those two cases were decided on the trustee, homestead provision, wherein the government, bartered for this land from the tribe but they didn't guarantee the sale of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.137" offset="15895907">They said, we'll put it up for sale for you, we'll have it homesteaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.030" offset="15919522">When that's paid for, then the money will be in trust for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.520" offset="15945435">That was the fatal error of the circuit court of appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.593" offset="15965706">The circuit court of appeals said in this Feather case that this was not a session agreement and it absolutely was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.506" offset="16021400">It said it's like Mattz and Seymour, a trustee type deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.991" offset="16051388">Feather, I don't know why they decided that, but I think just in the glair of Mattz and Seymour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.404" offset="16096946">Now, all of the cases or all of the reservations in 1891 in this Indian Allotment Act of which Sisseton-Wahpeton was a part, as far as we have been able to determine, we are restored to the public domain and they were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.921" offset="16215019">Some had public domain wording, some had wording like this, the CRoW Act had a little different wording, but by the legislative history, by the face of the Act, we could determine, and from what Senator Dawes says, it was going to do, the seven or eight million acres went to the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.625" offset="16293909">The circuit court of appeals says that a session isn't a session and in the briefs sometimes we are arguing that public domain isn't public domain, cede and sell doesn't mean cede and sell and it's down to the point, Your Honors, that this area as so far as, as can be possibly done, should be decided because, since Newtown and Mattz and Seymour, this is breaking out, the litigation allover and I don't see any ending site.</text>

            <text syncTime="4239.659" offset="17062013">I want to say a word first about any Indian reservation, before talking about this one because it seems to me the discussion so far has been a bit confusing about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.660" offset="17102033">In almost every Indian reservation in the country, there is land, that has been allotted to Indians, there is land that has been sold and fee simpled to people who are not Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.839" offset="17142680">There is often a large Non-Indian population inside an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.489" offset="17165354">One of the characteristics of this reservation is that there is such a large Indian population inside it and that there is a going tribe within organized government and agency of the BIA and very alive and viable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.503" offset="17229406">Basically, and without trying to go in all of the details of it, the State in which an Indian reservation is situated has full jurisdiction over Non-Indians who live inside an Indian reservation, both civil and criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.097" offset="17287711">This court held so in number of cases starting in the 19th century with McBratney and Draper which were criminal cases and Justice Frankfurter laid this out in a good deal of detail and Cake versus Eagen and the Metlakatla cases and about--</text>

            <text syncTime="4346.089" offset="17487705">Now, I think I need to review some law concerning this treaty as well as this reservation as well as the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.558" offset="17557608">First briefly the facts, a permanent reservation was established by Treaty in 1867 with surveyed boundaries, and it's this reservation which was much smaller than the land the Indians had previously had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.592" offset="17621765">They had already had their big loss of land, and this was what was left to them, after great amounts of land had been taken away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.870" offset="17662830">Then, by an agreement in 1889 made specifically under the General Allotment Act and at a time when the Indians were in great distress, the monies owed to them by the Federal Government had not been paid to them, it was the middle of Winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.093" offset="17767737">The Federal Government negotiated with the tribe to do what's known as open its reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.356" offset="17792815">That is to allow the sale of surplus land within the reservation and in this agreement and then in the act of Congress that ratified it, there are numerous references to the General Allotment Act, there is no such thing as was true with the North half of the Colville reservation where particular part of the reservation was cut off and an expressed language was used saying that, that has been removed from the reservation, you heard some talk that the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.672" offset="17922069">What's important in this act, is there is no language saying that this was returned to the public domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="4515.321" offset="18164694">It was put in the Treasury of the United States to be used for their benefit; in other words, it's a bookkeeping entry from one government place to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.480" offset="18205341">The money, the Indian agency was maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.433" offset="18217148">The money was appropriated by the government as needed for the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.469" offset="18237210">The land was opened for homesteading, but only for homesteading, not for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.837" offset="18266676">You have exact same actual dynamic that occurred in the South half of the Colville Reservation, which this court held in Seymour v. Superintendent, did not abolish that reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.056" offset="18319548">The same dynamic that was done in Mattz v. Arnett as to that reservation namely, the non-Indians got what they wanted, the Indians got what they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.241" offset="18368345">The non-Indians got the right to settle that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.354" offset="18380779">The Indians got the money from the settlement of that land, which was small enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.125" offset="18403871">The question remaining is what happened to the federal jurisdiction, what happened to the jurisdiction of the tribe, and I want to approach that problem now.</text>

            <text syncTime="4586.885" offset="18450892">Would it be fair to say that the United States in those transactions was acting as the broker for the Indians to announce publicly that settlers could come in and buy it for $2.50 half an acre?</text>

            <text syncTime="4599.124" offset="18499897">It's exactly so and we quote in our brief, where one of the senators objected to the session idea, to the fact that the government would pay the money immediately, and one of the other senators explained to him says, “This doesn't mean anything, because this is just a bookkeeping transaction in the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.879" offset="18562905">We get right back the money that we are going to pay to the Indians as we sell off the land”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.708" offset="18590177">Now, in some later acts, the government decided to do it the other way, to not pay the Indians at first, to only pay the Indians as the land was sold, but the practical effect of both kinds of acts is identical, that the Indians kept -- lived on the allotted land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.233" offset="18664260">The un-allotted land was opened up for homesteading because it was thought and this was said to the Indians in the negotiations, and this court talked about this in Mattz versus Arnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.308" offset="18712639">The excuse for doing this kind of thing was that it was for the benefit of the Indians to do it, that it was better for them to live next to a high caliber of citizen who would be farming his land and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.303" offset="18756629">That's the kind of language that was used.</text>

            <text syncTime="4869.773" offset="19582516">The early questions that were unresolved was whether a reservation existed at all after there had been allotments and whether even alloted land was Indian land under federal jurisdiction and the court first addressed that question in 1909 in US v Celestine in which it held that even though land had been alloted to an Indian and patented to the Indian, that the land remained inside the Indian reservation that no land was removed from an Indian reservation until it's specifically removed by Congress from the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.207" offset="19744162">That proposition was extended in 1916 in United States versus Nice, which held that the tribal relations of the Indians continues, and that federal liquor laws applying to Indians -- would apply to Indians anywhere within the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.182" offset="19836113">But the important thing was this, that the States were claiming just as the State claims here that opening a reservation and allotting lands to Indians meant that State jurisdiction, that federal jurisdiction and tribal jurisdiction would only apply on the allotted lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.823" offset="19930676">And this creates several problems, one is the obvious one of having check plat books to see whose jurisdiction applies where.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.878" offset="19958888">The other one is even a bit more complicated, these red dots move around.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.823" offset="19974666">The tribe buys new land, the land can be consolidated, under recent act of Congress, this tribe has an active program of purchasing new land which Congress described as within the reservation, thereby again recognizing that the reservation still existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5694.153" offset="22880005">It is very, very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.277" offset="22896515">As far as this tribal resolution is concerned that has been brought up here, I have been advised that this was vacated very soon after it was enacted -- tried to be enacted, they could see the fallacy, it was explained by a counsel where they were off on the wrong foot on the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.582" offset="22965687">But, the big thing that this Feather case has is not going onto the civil part of questions that have been propounded, I realize that they can come in indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.981" offset="23007274">But, that is coming on to this Federal jurisdiction and this of course, starts out a long ways back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.999" offset="23039352">I think one thing that comes onto this Federal jurisdiction, that hasn't been brought out here today, we brought it out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5741.247" offset="23068400">And that is in 1901, the State ceded all federal criminal, ceded to the Federals, all state jurisdiction over federal offenses, and in 1903 the Federals assumed this jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.794" offset="23138513">We have this in our brief and it's a thing that the Circuit Court of Appeals did and I argued this to them, when we did argue the Circuit Court of Appeals, (Inaudible) I argued in DeMarrias, I was a culprit on DeMarrias in the Circuit Court of Appeals, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.604" offset="23197759">I wasn't able to do the chores that I should have, but I nevertheless was there. But, in the second time, in Feather case, this was brought up, it wasn't a controlling factor by then because they felt, as we can very well see their position that this Mattz case, the Newtown case, the Condon case, the Seymour case, all came in and answered this question perhaps easier, perhaps in a different way, perhaps more definitely than it was handled or could be handled by this 1903 and this 1901 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5860.245" offset="23544351">We feel that the case that we have before us, as far as a criminal is concerned is very, very much on a par with the Seymour case, but it's on a par with the Newtown case which is of course up there in our Federal District Court with the Mattz case that it definitely does reverse DeMarrias.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.639" offset="23629928">There is no question about that, that has been spoken of here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.989" offset="23647378">But, in order to reverse this and go back to DeMarrias, we believe that it would be necessary to reverse also the Seymour case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.567" offset="23709654">In fact, after the Seymour case, our State Supreme Court in Molash (ph) came down with a very nice decision on another circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.773" offset="23750510">They reversed some other decisions there, perhaps pick on them for the minute that they did not in their decision say that they were reversing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.717" offset="23790216">They just went ahead with it, they came on to those different parts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5926.056" offset="23807561">But we believe that we have to go back to this original case of Celestine which definitely has the principle that Congress is the only one that can diminish this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.386" offset="23880913">That Congress has not diminished, has not seen fit to diminish this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5950.149" offset="23904005">By 1151 in itself and 1151 especially with the Footnotes and 1153 with the Footnotes, as is brought out in our brief here on the thing, definitely goes on the principle that Congress is annoyingly, is assuming jurisdiction on all of the reservation, not just the part that is trust land as the state would have us believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.066" offset="24015600">And that's the only thing that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.308" offset="24028557">If we don't have such a situation as that, we have the thing that was brought up right here to start with and that is a checkerboard, that is a thing that this court in Seymour wanted to stray away from, wanted to keep away from on the thing and they so ably set it out in Seymour on the thing, and if we don't have Federal Jurisdiction of this whole reservation, we will come right back into this thing that you try to guard against in the Seymour case and that is a checker boarded situation, someone would have called it a crazy quilt situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6086.551" offset="24449546">Mr. Day if you can finish in ten minutes, we will finish today and let you get back to the Indian country, otherwise we will go over till tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.789" offset="24486536">Do you think, you can finish in ten minutes.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Day, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6097.926" offset="24495104">Yes, I can sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.893" offset="24514957">Your Honors, my brother Mr. Sachse says that this is almost like the situation in Mattz, it's almost a trustee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.829" offset="24606699">It really does the same thing because you are putting it in out of one till into the other, and that's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6137.783" offset="24654555">It isn't the same, it's clearly not the same on the face of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6145.797" offset="24686529">It's a direct session and sale, it's not the same money, the government doesn't do the same things, it's not the same wording.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.971" offset="24731251">And if it's clearly plain, it should be left clearly plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6167.084" offset="24771688">Counsel, my brother Mr. Gustafson, I am sure, has been States Attorney in his area, as I have down close to my reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6182.037" offset="24831561">I don't know my brother Sachse's information, Plat Book or Checkerboard jurisdiction for officers that grow up and live in that country is no big problem, because in most instances, the land is leased by people and most of the crimes are committed in the towns where it's normally all, mostly all fee patented and there is no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.066" offset="24951620">Speaking personally, if I can for a moment, I was also a tribal judge for about five years out in the Rosebud Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="6219.763" offset="24982444">I probably was only a white tribal judge in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.246" offset="24996342">I think, I know, how it is, on closed portions of reservations, on 1151 (a) and it's also on 1151 (c), that's not the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.671" offset="25066036">The issue in this case is was this, the boundaries of this reservation diminished?</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.227" offset="25092263">If they were on the face of the act this Court should say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.414" offset="25113057">If they weren't on the face of the Act, but were by surrounding history, legislative intent then the Court under its own rules should say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.256" offset="25164361">And I believe that if -- I know you will read them, I believe that it's clear, first on the face and if not but both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.218" offset="25212217">When you sum it all up, it comes up to about 98 anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="6289.534" offset="25261537">Thank you.</text>
