            <text syncTime="37.395" offset="252949">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.636" offset="269876">I think it is fair to say that the facts of these particular consolidated cases are simple and are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.364" offset="300805">The named plaintiffs were marines stationed at El Toro Marine Base near Los Angeles, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.111" offset="327868">They were all in pay grades E1-E4, the lowest pay grades in military services and, therefore, subject to summary court-martial under Article 20 of the Uniform Code Military Justice and, if convicted, they could stand confin -- they would be confined for up to 30 days and five of the named plaintiffs were so-convicted and sentenced to -- up to 30 days respectively for various minor offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.545" offset="469556">And, at their summary courts-martial, they did not have their own retained or -- their own retained counsel nor were they appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.759" offset="514382">Three of the named plaintiffs were ordered to stand trial subject at the summary courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.058" offset="539564">Those trials were not yet convened at the time the action was brought but they, too, were advised that they would not have appointed counsel at summary courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.627" offset="589928">A class action, worldwide in scope, was brought for habeas corpus relief of the five imprisoned as result of the summary courts-martial convictions and sentenced, and there was a prayer for relief in the nature of mandamus, also for injunction against the topmost officials of the Navy and the Marine Corps.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.645" offset="694000">And, the named plaintiffs' commanding officers at El Toro Marine Base requiring the relief -- required that the accused servicemen at summary courts-martial resulting in confinement be provided the opportunity to have the assistance of defense counsel who does not also represent the prosecution and, in the District Court, all of the -- this requested relief was granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.288" offset="864528">In all of this discussion, Mr. Chief Justice, we are referring as counsel being not necessarily a lawyer, but a person who, in some degree at least, might be of assistance to the accused.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="203.931" stopTime="206.938">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="203.931" offset="919071">In other words, the “next friend” concept is what you're talking about.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan R. Zahm</label>
            <text syncTime="206.938" offset="931088">The “next friend” might be a proper term, Your Honor, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.647" offset="945925">There have been cases which we could go into later if the court pleases where the military Court of the highest nature, the United States Court of Military Appeals, is determined that, constitutionally speaking, unless Congress has otherwise required, counsel does not mean lawyer counsel and so here, we, in this case, are speaking of counsel from the constitutional standpoint of being a person who assists the accuse at trial who is not necessarily lawyer-counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.109" offset="1095764">At any rate, the District Court in this case granted habeas corpus relief to those who had been confined, and issued relief in the nature of mandamus on a worldwide level.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.452" offset="1153128">Now, the issue before this Court is whether the holding of this Court in Argersinger versus Hamlin, 407 U.S. in the year 1972, in which this Court held in a landmark decision that an accuse in any criminal prosecution for whatever offense, petty or otherwise, may not be deprived of his liberty if he was denied the assistance of counsel at trial and, this, by virtue of the right to assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and also the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="308.886" offset="1338911">I suppose, well, what would be your answer to this, suppose instead of confinement, following a summary court-martial of this kind, the penalty provided was six months -- loss of pay for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.707" offset="1394186">That would be much more painful perhaps than 30 days for many people, wouldn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan R. Zahm</label>
            <text syncTime="326.613" offset="1409860">Your Honor, it might be more painful, we might agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.180" offset="1424071">But, from the standpoint of the decision of this Court in Argersinger, we are limited to the decision of this Court with reference to loss of liberty.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="339.450" stopTime="350.132">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="339.450" offset="1461164">I just wanted to be sure that you were only arguing to the Argersinger point and not any penalty, however heavy it might be.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_r_zahm" startTime="350.132" stopTime="410.431">
            <label>Mr. Nathan R. Zahm</label>
            <text syncTime="350.132" offset="1503901">Most specifically, Your Honor, we are in this case limiting ourselves to the decision of this Court in Argersinger with regard to loss of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.933" offset="1547055">Now, this question, of course, would never have arisen with regard to any other kind of courts-martial in the military for the reason that the Congress of the United States has seen to it in the Uniform Code of Military Justice that, in the general court-martial and the special court-martial, defense counsel shall be provided the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.545" offset="1653530">And so, the problem arises, therefore, only with regard to summary court-martial because, under Article 20 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, no provision is made in that article for defense counsel for the accused such as in the case of general court-martial and special court-martial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.070" offset="5615679">And, since Argersinger is an extension of Gideon versus Wainwright, we maintain that this Court should follow by the way what even the government previously has argued this term before this Court that the decisions, because of its special expertise of the United States Court of Military Appeals, should be followed by this very Court was the argument in the case this term by the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.674" offset="7994075">They've dealt with this by reading the opinion of the Court of Appeals under the Supreme Court in Argersinger and concluding quite summarily in the case of Judge Quinn's opinion and almost equally summarily in the case of Judge Duncan's that this was binding on the court of Military Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.849" offset="8062725">In fact, Judge Duncan said, as far as he was concerned, this was a perfectly fair and reasonable procedure and if he were not under the force of Argersinger he would uphold it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.393" offset="8528959">After all, in Morrissey, there was a liberty interest at steak and the Chief Justice began by recognizing that there was a substantial liberty interest that was being affected by this action and, therefore, looking into the due process requirement surrounding that and the court, nevertheless, recognized that it held that prospective in Morrissey and it subsequently recognized in Wolf that it -- that those kinds of rulings maybe prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.569" offset="8641599">I think it's a judgment and I think, in part, the judgment would turn on this Court's belief as to how defective these proceedings without counsel have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.425" offset="8769076">I think our opponents in this case are interested in analyzing the case by label.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.764" offset="8790392">They want to attach the label that says this is a criminal proceeding, and we don't deny that this is a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.729" offset="8814320">And then, they want to take the label “imprisonment” and then they want to ask the court to stop thinking about the case any further and proceed automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.682" offset="8846085">Now, I suggest that it's necessary to make a pragmatic and a functional analysis and to look at what's happening here and I -- as I say, I think the substantial problem about which we're concerned is the validity of these procedures in the first place, and the retroactivity problem is a quite secondary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.404" offset="8933021">Now, a little over 20 years ago in Burns against Wilson, this Court considered the nature of the constitutional protections applicable to the Military Justice System and, thus, the scope of its powers to oversee the operation of that system in these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.002" offset="8995401">It said the constitutional guarantee of due process is meaningful and often sufficiently adaptable to protect soldiers, as well as civilians, from the crude injustices of a trial so conducted that it becomes bent on fixing guilt by dispensing with rudimentary fairness rather than finding truth through adherence to those basic guarantees which have long been recognized and honored by Military Courts, as well as the Civilian Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.923" offset="9099055">Those words are in some ways reminiscent of Justice Cardozo's formulation of the power of this Court over State Courts in Palko against Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.105" offset="9139806">Of course, much has changed in our constitutional jurisprudence since those words were penned, but this Court has never stepped beyond the bounds of its self-imposed restraints in order to strike down as unconstitutional any provision of the Uniform Code of Military Justice or to invalidate any procedure deliberately chosen by Congress for the administration of military justice.</text>

          <turn speaker="frey" startTime="2763.777" stopTime="2981.925">
            <label>Mr. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="2763.777" offset="11158444">No, I was just saying that it can't have counsel, but there is no doubt that Congress, which is supposed to provide for the administration of military justice, deliberately selected a system in which Summary Courts would not entail a provision of counsel and if you look at Article 27 which deals with the provision of counsel in special and general Courts, it's clear that this was a carefully thought out deliberate decision of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.436" offset="11269099">Now, the framework of analysis for a case of this sort, we suggest, is found in the court's recent decision in Parker against Levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.372" offset="11308910">Now, the court there recognized the important differences between the military and the civilian community and the differences in their criminal justice systems that flowed from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.101" offset="11355826">These differences derive in a large part from the special relationship of the government to its servicemen and the vastly greater proportion of the serviceman's life that is subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.688" offset="11406085">And, in light of this, the court held in Parker against Levy, “for the reasons which differentiate military society from civilian society,” and I'm quoting from page 21 of the Slip opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.623" offset="11461883">“We think Congress is permitted to legislate both with greater breath and with greater flexibility when prescribing the rules by which the former, that is the military society, shall be governed than when it-- than it is when prescribing the rules for the latter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.839" offset="11518725">It then went on to say at page 23, “the fundamental necessity for obedience and the consequent necessity for the imposition of discipline may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.529" offset="11577448">Against this background, I would like the court now to consider the role that the summary courts-martial plays in the system that Congress has established for the administration of military justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.240" offset="11620289">System is a flexible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.360" offset="11628857">As you've read, I'm sure there are four levels which it designed to deal with the broad range of offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.222" offset="11652263">The most minor disciplinarian fractions are dealt with the most informally in a proceeding that is quite limited and the punishments that could be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.792" offset="11686536">The most grave are dealt with in proceedings of considerable formality with substantial procedural protections and potent penalties available, that is, the general Court-Martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.969" offset="11731257">Now, this Court recognized in Parker against Levy that the Article 15 proceeding which imposes punishments which, in most respects, are similar to the punishments at Summary Court but which does not include confinement of hard labor, that that part took in many ways of the aspects of a labor relations matter between an employer and an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.708" offset="11822164">Well here, while it's true that we have a criminal proceeding, it's also true that the Summary Court, the next step up in the scale, partakes very much of the same factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.328" offset="11872632">Its' frequently used for the -- it can be used for the same kinds of offenses for which non-judicial punishment under Article 15 could be employed or for which a special Court could be convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.510" offset="11925400">Part of the judgment that would go into the decision to invoke a Summary Court would be, for instance, that this particular individual had committed the same offenses several times, he'd been punished under Article 15, he was not responding to discipline, and it was necessary to step up a little the degree of punishment that could be imposed on him in an effort to generate obedience and discipline on this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.952" offset="12275231">Now, the summary courts-martials are mostly for military types of offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.687" offset="12290069">Still, these are the vast bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.317" offset="12300622">I think it was 86%, according to the table we have in our brief, are offenses that would not be offenses in civilian life at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.322" offset="12332701">Majority of them are unauthorized absence, also, disobeying an order, disrespect to a superior officer, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.301" offset="12364570">There are substantial procedural differences, some we've shown in our brief that the summary courts-martial takes about, before Alderman, took about 33 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.258" offset="12408456">Special Courts take somewhere in the order of two to three times as long from charge to disposition, it seem to me, clear reasons why the Navy would prefer not to use a special Court if it didn't feel that such severe punishments were necessary to deal with a particular offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.347" offset="12488808">Now, if this Court's decision substantially alters and impairs the utility and the flexibility of the summary courts-martial, then the carefully balanced structure, graduated procedures, and penalties established by Congress will be itself impaired and its character substantially altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.135" offset="12559862">These consequences may, of course, be constitutionally compelled, and they would be if the court concludes that the use of non-adversarial procedures comes anywhere close, parking back to the Burns and Wilson language, to “the crude injustices of a trial so conducted that it becomes bent on fixing guilt by dispensing with rudimentary fairness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.835" offset="12646693">We don't think these words are even remotely applicable to the Summary Court procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.185" offset="12672084">In answering the constitutional inquiry that you have before you, there are three factors to be considered: first, the fairness of the procedures as a means of adjudicating guilt and imposing punishment for relatively minor infractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.280" offset="12724537">Second, a consideration of what is at stake for the individual in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.598" offset="12741778">In other words, what's the potential impact of a mistake on his life?</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.693" offset="12762154">Thirdly, what are the governmental interests that are served by the procedure?</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.058" offset="12779604">And, I'd like to consider that last factor first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.123" offset="12795904">The principal consideration that I think is important to the services in the use of a summary courts-martial is speed of disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.263" offset="12832475">They want to get the man back on the job swiftly to maximize the deterrent or corrective effect of the punishment, and I think it's well-recognized that a small punishment swiftly imposed is frequently much more effective as a means of correcting behavior than a larger punishment substantially delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.071" offset="12915649">Now, if you would look at the table at page 26 of our brief, you will see that what has happened since the first period, that is January 1 through June 30 of 1973, was largely pre-Alderman, counsels were generally not provided from -- during most of that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.059" offset="13007600">The two subsequent periods were post-Alderman, counsel was provided, and the time of disposition increased from 33.5 days approximately to, we have now a corrected figure on the basis of final figures that were not available at the time we did the brief, 43.62 days for the first half of Calendar 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.783" offset="13114493">Now, in their brief, my opponents have suggested that the increase in acquittal rates is the product of the provision of counsel and that this increases as much as 32% more acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.085" offset="13175724">I'm willing, for purposes of driving home a point which I think is very important for this Court to consider, to accept the proposition, although I'm not sure that it's scientifically valid, that the increase in acquittals is due to the presence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.967" offset="13239254">Now, if you will compute the effect of that, that is, if you will assume that the 4.9% acquittal rate during the pre-Alderman period is the rate of acquittals that would've occurred without counsel, you will find that out of about 8,800 cases there would've been approximately 80 people who were acquitted with counsel who would not have been acquitted without counsel, about 80 people out of 8,800 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.546" offset="13361507">Now in exchange, however, if you will attribute the increased time, and I'm not saying that this is precisely correct but I think of the major component in the increased time that it takes to try these cases as the presence of counsel, you will find that there are approximately 80,000 mandates of additional time of people having charges hanging over their heads indisposed as a result of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.245" offset="13472371">So, in other words, and I don't mean to minimize the importance for the 80 people who would've been convicted had they had not lawyers, the significance to the Navy and to these people is 80,000 mandates of people with charges hanging over their heads, people who can't be assigned on mission, and some of these people innocent with charges hanging over their heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.985" offset="13571323">Now, turning to the considerations of fairness, we think there are significant differences in terms of the fairness of the procedure as compared to the civilian procedures that this Court was considering in Argersinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.617" offset="13629837">I think one was brought out in the questioning of Mr. Zahm and it's a central one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.012" offset="13655437">This is not an adversarial procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.086" offset="13667767">The misdemeanor and petty offense trials at stake in Argersinger were adversarial procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.234" offset="13692322">They didn't always involve judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.354" offset="13700786">Sometimes in Police Courts, police officers presented the case but, even there, was somebody who was experienced in court who knew what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.511" offset="13733386">The inquisitorial system of justice is not so fundamentally unfair, as Justice Rehnquist pointed out, that it can't be used for substantial aspects of the criminal justice system in many European countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.537" offset="13777481">Also, the criminal justice system in the military is not burdened with the kinds of backlogs that cause the court concern in Argersinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.765" offset="13818441">The rush to judgment that was awarded in Argersinger, we believe, is clearly not a concern in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.811" offset="13850624">And, even in terms of impact on the individual, while I don't wish to minimize it, it is simply not as great as it is in civilian life, for instance, employment consequences, immediate employment consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.877" offset="13906840">A man in the Navy who's convicted at a summary courts-martial and goes to the brig for 3 weeks or 30 days, he has a job when he gets out.</text>
