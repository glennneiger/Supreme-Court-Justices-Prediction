            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Mr. Zahm, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="nathan_r_zahm" startTime="16.122" stopTime="683.624">
            <label>Mr. Nathan R. Zahm</label>
            <text syncTime="16.122" offset="64470">Mr. Chief Justice, if the court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.138" offset="80457">Since these consolidated cases are hear on re-argument today, it would seem unnecessary and more expeditious to refrain from repeating the facts of the case which are undisputed and are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.111" offset="152346">Suffice to say that in a routine manner, the petitioners, members of the Marine Core were up on charges on courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.919" offset="195605">Five of them were convicted and incarcerated as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.996" offset="215980">Three others were facing courts-martial and sought relief by way of injunction to prevent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.742" offset="246909">Now, we ask this court to affirm that the Sixth Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel in criminal prosecutions, which was this Court’s principal basis for its ruling in Argersinger versus Hamlin in 1972, also applies to persons in military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.123" offset="344398">Every Court that has ever considered the question including the Court of Military Appeals in United States v. Culp, United States versus Tempia in 1967, and more recently United States v. Alderman in 1973 has so held with the single exception, that being the Ninth Circuit in the case of Daigle v. Warner, which has petition pending here.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.273" offset="453068">Sub nom Crosby versus Warner.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.143" offset="468532">Now, the federal parties have asked this court for the first time ever to overrule the United States Court of Military Appeals on this issue, in favor of a single civilian Court’s view.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.522" offset="526002">Despite this Court’s repeated recognition over the years and repeated only last term, in Schlesinger versus Councilman, that Coma is the Court established by Congress to gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.994" offset="599876">Now for this court to do would undermine the Court of Military Appeals, very significant role as the Supreme Court of the Military which has been designated to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.374" offset="665496">Now, the only basis for the Ninth Circuit’s holing on this question of the Sixth Amendment’s application to the military is based on single historical treatise, specifically Weiners’ Harvard Law Review Article in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.347" offset="737384">Now, this despite the fact that there was another equally authoritative historical treatise in the Harvard Law Review the preceding year by Henderson on the identical question with exactly the opposite conclusion from that reached by Weiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.958" offset="807811">But the Ninth Circuit shows to go along with Weiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.412" offset="821603">Despite the fact that the Court of Military Appeals and every other court before whom the question has been raised with both those articles presented to the courts for their consideration have chosen Henderson instead, if they chose any.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.580" offset="890253">Now, with regard to the reliance on history for constitutional interpretation, where the documentation is inconclusive and disputable, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, dissenting with Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, just last Term on June 30th, stated in the case of Faretta versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.223" offset="996833">“Like Mr. Justice Blackmun I hesitate to participate in the Court’s attempt to use history to take it where legal analysis cannot, piecing together shreds of English Legal History and Early State Constitution and Statutory Provisions without a full elaboration of the context in which they occurred or any other evidence that they relied on, by the drafters of our Federal Constitution creates more questions than it answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.753" offset="1094949">And hardly provides the firm foundation upon which the creation of new Constitutional Rights should rest and more pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.321" offset="1129221">We are well reminded that this court once employed an exhaustive analysis of English and Colonial Practices regarding the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.802" offset="1163180">To justify the conclusion that it was fundamental to a fair trial and less than ten years later used essentially the same material to conclude that it was not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="301.936" offset="1207693">Compare Powell versus Alabama, and Betts v. Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.442" offset="1225665">I think that should be kept in mind when we are considering whether or not a fundamental question like this should be decided as the Ninth Circuit did on a single documentation which is in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.763" offset="1278955">Now aside from the disputed historical documentation on the question, logic demands acceptance of the view, that the framers of the Constitution did not intent to accept the Sixth Amendment from applicability to the Military Service by silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.235" offset="1356904">Because they specifically wrote in an expressed exception in the Fifth Amendment with regards to presentment or indictment of a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.528" offset="1398073">That is the position of the Court of Military Appeals which has considered the matter, United States versus Jacoby in 1960 and United States versus Tempia in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.260" offset="1448960">So we do not need this historical documentation which is in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.086" offset="1468291">Logic explains to us as the Court of Military Appeals has pointed out that if the framers intended an exception they would have done what they did with the Fifth, they would have written it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.402" offset="1525551">Now, this court in Parker versus Levy in 1974 implicitly affirms the impact of Burns versus Wilson some 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.866" offset="1575393">That quoting from United States versus Tempia, the protections of the constitution are available to servicemen in military trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.362" offset="1613427">Now, this court in Parker held, as the Court Of Military Appeals had previously held and recognize by virtue of the Priest case that was involved in the Parker case, that the constitutional guarantees may be applied differently to servicemen where military necessity requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.511" offset="1718021">In other words, where it can be shown and the burden is on the military to show it, that it requires a somewhat different application as applied to military men than as applied to civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.657" offset="1770580">Now the Court Of Military Appeals knew that full well as they indicated by their holding in Priest with regard to the issue of the First Amendment rights there involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.250" offset="1808927">And so, it is nothing new to the Court Of Military Appeals that there is such a doctrine that where military necessity requires it, the constitutional guarantees may be applied somewhat differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.445" offset="1869740">But the point is that in this case which does not involve the First Amendment but involves the Sixth Amendment where the Court Of Military Appeals recognizing this concept of military necessity has considered the issue, has decided that there is no military necessity for a ruling which would deny to men in service, their Sixth Amendment Rights of assistance to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.256" offset="1984993">I think that on this question of military necessity which the Federal Parties have led such great stress upon that the Ninth Circuit stated it most succinctly in their decision in Daigle versus Warner which is Crosby versus Warner petition pending in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.749" offset="2058971">I am quoting from the Ninth Circuit decision, “While the Navy argues with some vigor that naval discipline will suffer severely if appointed counsel are required, there is scant support if this in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.337" offset="2117277">The Army and Air Force already provide counsel to all accused before Summary courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.593" offset="2138279">And the Navy allows private retained counsel to participate in such proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.841" offset="2163357">The Navy suggest that the effectiveness of a Summary courts-martial as a tool for preserving discipline and order will be undermined by the participation of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.068" offset="2200242">If so, this must already be true as to those defendants who can afford retained counsel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="560.872" offset="2243396">Now aside from the argument with regard to military necessity, I think this also points out that it is a refutation of the argument also made that affording counsel to men in service disrupts some Congressional Scheme which specifically according to the federal parties is designed not to provide counsel to men in service at Summary courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.024" offset="2352065">Now the fact is that when Congress adopted the Military Practices Act in 1968, the decision of this Court in Argersinger had not yet been rendered which was in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.694" offset="2410684">so it is fairly clear that if Congress had known that this court considered for the first time, mind you, that petty offenses required assistance of counsel, they might have considered differently when passing that Act in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.214" offset="2492813">And the net effect as it stands now is that yes, retained counsel by those servicemen who can afford retained counsel are permitted to have counsel at Summary courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.904" offset="2559582">The practical result is, that those who do not have counsel because they are not afforded counsel in Summary courts-martial are the poor, the indigent, the enlisted man of the lowest ranks who cannot afford to retain counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.038" offset="2624052">Now certainly Congress did not intend that that should be the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.670" offset="2642651">That is not the congressional scheme of Congress and the fact that a counsel may be retained by a servicemen in a Summary courts-martial indicates that there is no firm scheme on the part of Congress that absolutely under no circumstances shall there be appointed counsel at Summary courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.625" offset="2722482">Excuse me.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.220" offset="3500826">Now the federal parties have made the point that the Court of Military Appeals was not considering this question of military necessity when they decided in United States versus Alderman with the favorable view with regard to the Sixth Amendment Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.053" offset="3604167">Now, we have taken the opportunity in our brief to quote in full that portion of the brief that was presented in the Alderman Case before the Court of Military Appeals, on its entire question of military necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.138" offset="3668532">Pages 15 to 28 of our brief are directly quoted from the brief presented to the Court of Military Appeals in Alderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.379" offset="3701447">This specifically indicates that that issue of military necessity was very forcefully made by the Navy before the Court of Military Appeals fully considered by the Court of Military Appeals and in their opinion, the Court of Military Appeals in Alderman flatly stated that there is no showing of burden, no showing of military necessity made out to indicate that the Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel should be deprived to men in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.527" offset="3822028">Again we have cited at length and quoted at length in our brief from the Fidel Articles, Summary Courts-Martial, a proposal in 1971, pages 29 and 30 of our second brief in which, although the entire Article shows that there is no military necessity for Summary courts-martials in general, the specific is made in that Article by Fidel that the number of Summary courts-martials dropped from 64% of the total number of Courts-martials in the military in 1962 to 25% in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.300" offset="3973120">He suggests the obvious that the reason for the drop in Summary courts-martials in those years which were pre-Alderman years, pre-Argersinger years, when as we have indicated previously since June 8, 1973, the Navy along with the Army and the Air Force has been providing counsel as a result of the Alderman decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.870" offset="4075416">But prior to that time --</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.974" offset="4079804">In the service, when a naval person is charged, does he have an initial option to take a General Court-martial in place of a Summary, right at the time of the charge could he opt for a General Court-martial?</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.487" offset="4153887">He would be given at a very early stage upon being charged with the Summary courts-martial, he would be given the opportunity to opt but he certainly would not be opting for a General court-martial, if he was going to opt at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.513" offset="4201953">Now, the only conceivable reason from a practical stand point that the man who could have a summary courts-martial without counsel would choose Special Courts-martial with the greater risk of greater punishment would be that he feels, if he is sophisticated enough and most of these men are not, that if he has a lawyer, he probably will not go to jail at all, at least he has a chance of not going to jail at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.869" offset="4303412">And what he is trying to avoid which is the very thing that Argersinger with regard to civilians was all about was not to be forced to go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.872" offset="4343432">Liberty, not to be forced to go to jail, it is the right to have counsel before your sentence to jail to have the defense of counsel of your own personal counsel which is the whole principle of Argersinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.142" offset="4400483">And it should certainly apply to our men in service who have every right to be protected by the Constitution even more so perhaps because they are serving their country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.992" offset="4435905">And they should not be penalized because they are wearing the uniform of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.968" offset="4459833">So, the reason given by Fidel which is the obvious one for the tremendous drop in Summary courts-martials in those years between 1962 and 69, is that in 1962, the Article 15 Provisions were so strengthened by Congress that the military commanders themselves saw that it was much more practical to give a man an Article 15 which is non-judicial punishment than to go through this procedure of a summary courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.582" offset="4602253">And so the basic reason for the drop in Summary courts-martials even prior to the Alderman decision which had nothing to do with the requirement of giving counsel was the Article 15 practicality that commanders saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.235" offset="4660872">And there was this complete drop in summary courts-martials for that reason which is certainly strong indication of a lack of military necessity for Summary courts-martials in the first place, with or without counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.415" offset="7533610">In keeping with this intended purpose, Congress made a deliberate decision to entrust the active conduct of the trial to an impartial court officer rather than an opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.858" offset="7587422">This Congressional determination is entitled to great deference since this court has longed recognized, it is the constitutional role of Congress and no the courts to strike the balance between the rights of men and the armed forces and certain overwriting demands of discipline and duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.629" offset="8026488">Even if it results in jail and the considerations that go into the analysis or whether the military has a significant interest or whether Congress reasonably concluded that the military has a significant interest in this kind of procedure plus an examination of the fairness of the procedure and what is its stake for the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.997" offset="8139964">Now this Court’s decision in Parker v. Levy also provides a framework of analysis for a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.889" offset="8167549">There the Court recently stated that the fundamental necessity for deceit -- for obedience, and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.248" offset="8232960">The court in Levy reaffirmed the principle that because of the unique mission of the armed forces many constitutional protections apply to servicemen in different degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.147" offset="8276532">There the court held that the proper standard of review for a vagueness challenge to the UCMJ even with respect to statutes impinging on the First Amendment, is that which applies to civilian criminal statues regulating economic affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.989" offset="8339853">And we submit that these rules governing a right to counsel and civilian adversary proceeding cannot be mechanically applied to Courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.001" offset="8375902">Specifically labels such as incarceration and criminal prosecution do not automatically establish a right to counsel under Argersinger and related civilian cases dealing with the different system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.322" offset="8433267">What is needed here rather is a pragmatic functional analysis of the problem and such an approach we think reveals that Congress in determining that this should be an inquisitorial kind of procedure rather than a strictly adversarial procedure has fairly and reasonably accommodated the private and governmental interest is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.402" offset="8517590">And we emphasize first of all, that the Summary Court-martial in the form intended by Congress is a fundamentally fair procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.209" offset="8552803">A fundamental rationale underlying Argersinger and related cases was that it is grossly unfair to pit or lay accused against illegally trained prosecutor or anyone who has experience in the court room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.806" offset="8607138">In the Summary Court-martial of course there was no prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.493" offset="8621871">The only people present aside from necessary witnesses are the accused and the court officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.246" offset="8648934">The manual for courts-martial which implements the code, describes the basic role of the court officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.836" offset="8679340">He will thoroughly and impartially inquire into both sides of the matter and will assure that the interests of both the Government and the accused are safeguarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.903" offset="8719569">The manual also contains extensive regulations requiring the court officer to play an active role in helping the accused, present his case and develop his evidence and there is no reason to assume that the court officer does not fulfill that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.583" offset="8782263">Another concern in Argersinger was the unfairness produced by the rush to justice in civilian misdemeanor courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.639" offset="8810475">The Summary Court-martial presents no such problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.679" offset="8822700">All justices swift the proceeding itself is dignified and orderly and there is no necessity for assembly line justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.463" offset="8853838">Now if the presence of a defense counsel really improved the fairness of summary court proceedings significantly, one would expect to see a significant decline in the percentage of convictions following the Navy’s implementation of Alderman on June 8, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.681" offset="8930638">This is not the case as our supplemental brief show on page 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.633" offset="8950491">Except for the last few weeks of fiscal year 1973 ending in June 30th 1973, counsel was not provided at summary courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.317" offset="8989257">During that fiscal year the conviction rate at summary courts was 95.2% and calendar year 1974 the last annual period for which final statistics were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.353" offset="9045368">The percentage of convictions at summary courts was 93.6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.744" offset="9066893">This figure represents a decline of only 1.6% as compared to fiscal year 1973 and of course we cannot be certain that the presence of defense counsel at summary courts has actually caused this 1.6% decline in the percentage of convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.347" offset="9133349">But even if there is a casual connection the 1.6% decline does not necessarily indicate that the presence of counsel has improved fairness or accuracy of the fact finding process.</text>
