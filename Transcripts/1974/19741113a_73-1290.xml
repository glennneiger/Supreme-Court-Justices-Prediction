            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in United States against ITT Continental Baking company.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.030" offset="263502">Mr. Friedman you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="friedman" startTime="43.341" stopTime="217.924">
            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="43.341" offset="276773">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.912" offset="290983">The Clayton and the Federal Trade Commission Acts provide a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for any violation of an order of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.086" offset="339675">The statutes further provide that, where the violation consists of a continuing refusal or neglect to obey the order of the Commission, then each day for which the violation continues is a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.458" offset="409161">The question in this case, which is here on the writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is whether where a respondent under a Commission order, prohibiting certain acquisitions without the prior approval of the Commission, makes those acquisitions in violation of the order, each day that the respondent continues to hold the illegally acquired property is a separate offense, or whether as the Court of Appeals held in this case in conflict with a decision of the Eight Circuit, there is only a single offense committed in each of those situations, that is the single act of acquisition and what happened in this case for these acquisitions only single penalties of the maximum of $5,000 was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.232" offset="600273">In 1960, the Federal Trade Commission issued an administrative complaint against the respondent's predecessor, the Continental Baking Company, in which it charged that since 1952 Continental, which was one of the largest baking companies in the country, had engaged in what it described as the continuous practice of acquiring bakeries throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.325" offset="716675">The complaint alleged that seven specific acquisitions of bakeries made by Continental, violated Section VII of the Clayton Act, and it also alleged that various practices committed by Continental, violated, constituted unfair acts and practices in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.242" offset="812387">After some hearings were held before an examiner, the case was settled in 1962, through the entry of a consent order.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.918" offset="855019">They ordered the two things basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.054" offset="863587">First it directed Continental to divest itself of a principle acquisition challenged in the complaint, a firm called Armour Bakeries, which it was believed was the eighth largest bakery in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.700" offset="926177">And secondly, it imposed a prohibition upon Continental for ten years, against making certain acquisitions without the authority previously given by the Commission.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="217.924" offset="975078">Mr. Friedman, do you think that, that provision indicates that the court felt the holding of the other acquisitions was not improper, when it so specifically spelled out Armour?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="friedman" startTime="231.790" stopTime="234.437">
            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="231.790" offset="1030562">I am sorry Mr. Chief Justice this is in the Commission complaint.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="234.437" stopTime="236.240">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="234.437" offset="1041115">Alright.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="friedman" startTime="236.240" stopTime="843.709">
            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="236.240" offset="1048325">I don't think that there was let me say, there was, at the time that they entered into the consent order, there was also an appendix that the parties signed which they said would provide a basis upon which the Commission could determine whether it was in the public interest to enter this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.386" offset="1132962">And in the course of that's which was, it was the part of the agreement to settle the case on consent, and in that agreement with respect to at least two of these acquisitions they concluded that there was not a violation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.657" offset="1181968">But I don't think the fact that the Commission limited the divestiture to Armour could be fairly viewed as any indication that it concluded that the rest of the acquisitions were not illegal, this was a consent order, and this was a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.078" offset="1239646">They agreed to give up the major acquisition they've made in return for which the Commission allowed them to keep some of the others and that they both agreed to include this ten-year ban on further acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.912" offset="1291055">Now that provision is set out at pages 88â€“89 of the record, and what it says, directed the respondent to cease and desist for ten years without the prior approval of the Commission from acquiring directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries or otherwise, the whole or any part of the stock, share capital, or assets of any concern, corporate, or non-corporate engaged in any state of the United States in the production of the sale of bread and bread-type rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.117" offset="1415816">Now, as I've indicated, the agreement which the party signed consenting to this order stated two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.897" offset="1455000">First, it stated that in construing this order, any of the parties could properly, the Commission and the parties could properly refer to the complaint itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.815" offset="1498676">And in two provisions of the complaint, that we think are significant in determining the purpose of this ban on acquisitions for ten years without prior Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.467" offset="1545279">One of the allegations was, that as result of these acquisitions Continental had eliminated these acquired bakeries as independent competitive factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.078" offset="1595643">The other thing that the complaint referred to, was there was a substantial trend to industry wide concentration in the baking business.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.175" offset="1636080">These two allegations are set forth at pages 67-68 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.938" offset="1663143">Now, in addition there were certain things stated in the appendix which was made a part of the agreement on the consent order, which bore on what the Commission was thinking when it approved this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.791" offset="1718523">The reason for that is the parties stipulated, that these were factors that the Commission could consider in determining whether it would be the public interest to adopt this consent order.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.108" offset="1767842">And at pages -- page 84, which is the end of the appendix, I would like to read just two sentences at the -- just before the first full paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.359" offset="1816848">The parties said that, if this order is adopted by the Commission, the respondent's alleged continuous practice of acquiring companies baking and selling bread and bread-type rolls will be brought to a halt and the major acquisition forming the gravamen of the complaint will be undone.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.051" offset="1899604">Competition may be restored essentially as it existed before the accusation of Armour Inc. and the public interest will be well served.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.390" offset="1936906">Now, it seems to us that rather clearly, what the parties intended this order to do is two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.619" offset="1961880">One, to bring to a halt the alleged practice of Continental of increasing concentration by acquiring one bakery after another and secondly, to undo one of the principal adverse effects on competition resulting from these acquisitions by requiring divestiture of the major accusation, the Armour bakeries.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.903" offset="2051009">This order was approved by the Commission in May, of 1962, and in 1966 the Commission undertook an investigation to determine whether certain conduct by Continental violated the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.863" offset="2110777">Specifically, it looked into three transactions which formed the violations involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.423" offset="2137109">The transactions are substantially similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.662" offset="2145991">In each case, there was an independent bakery which previously had both produced bread and roll, and distributed it and in each case the independent bakery agreed in effect with Continental, that it would give up its production of the bakery products, and would instead distribute to its previous existing customers, the products that were made by Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.152" offset="2247973">In other words Continental in effect, took over, took over the routes and provided the bread for these customers that had previously been the property of the independent customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.921" offset="2319026">The stipulated facts in this case, on the basis of which the district court decided it, are that the independent bakery distributed these products of Continental exclusively under Continental's name over the routes and to the same customers that it had hitherto distributed its own product.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.052" offset="2423620">And since -- there's a question here as to what, whether this was an acquisition of assets, I think it's not insignificant that each of the written agreements under which Continental took this over, are captioned sales agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.773" offset="2478477">After investigation of these, nine of these transactions, in 1968 the Federal Trade Commission certified the case in accordance with the statute to the Attorney General asking that penalties be sort for these three violations of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.132" offset="2547858">In the interim, and the complaint was filed in December 1968, in the interim in September 1968, Continental Baking was acquired by the present respondent ITT Continental, a wholly on subsidy area of International Telephone and Telegraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.441" offset="2621106">The government's theory upon which it sought these penalties, was that these transactions violated the ban and the order against acquiring directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the assets of a bakery firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.911" offset="2687039">The District Court held that two of the violations violated the order but that the third one didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.418" offset="2713057">The Court of Appeals affirmed the findings of two violations but disagreed with the court of -- with the District Court as to the third and held that all three of them violated the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.063" offset="2755584">I think the rationale of these holdings is well set forth in the District Court's finding that it said, this is at page 14 (A) of the appendix to our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.561" offset="2805635">It said particularly in businesses where route salesman are involved, customer lists have a peculiar value and that they frequently represent the principal asset of a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.767" offset="2846490">And it said that in connection with these transactions, the most important assets that Continental acquired were the sales routes and sales volume and in reversing the one transaction that the District Court had held did not violate the order, the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.389" offset="2908975">Court of Appeals said that the market, that is the customers and the volume, the business of distributing the bread was acquired and this was a principle asset of the bakery.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.737" offset="2966340">This determination reflected one of the facts stipulated in the District Court which is at page 31 of the appendix that route books and customer lists are asset of any person, firm or corporation engaged in the distribution and sale of bakery products.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.456" offset="3037184">The complaint in this case sought penalties of $1,000 a day for each of these three acquisitions, for each day that they held them from the time of the acquisitions and the transactions until the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.588" offset="3109700">The District Court rejected this claim ruling that this was not a continuing violation within the meaning of the penalty provision, but was merely a single violation and necessed a penalty for each of the two violations, the maximum statutory penalty of $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.286" offset="3184515">What the court said is that the order prescribes only the active acquisition not any retention and it said once these two acquisitions were accomplished, the violations were completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.532" offset="3237491">And the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit confirmed that holding saying that the -- once again the order does not bar the retention of assets illegally acquired but only the acquisition itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.443" offset="3289109">Now subsequent to the decision of the Tenth Circuit in this case, in a case which is now pending on certiorari called Beatrice Foods v. United States, the Eighth Circuit reach the contrary conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.291" offset="3340518">It held in a very similar situation involving a dairy however and not a bread company but it was a continuing violation and it accordingly approved in the Beatrice Foods case, the assessment of daily penalties of $200 a day from the date that Beatrice Foods took over the supplying of milk to the dairy, to the point that the complaint was filed, the total violation that was approved in the Beatrice -- I am sorry that was approved in the Beatrice Foods case, was $156,000 and in --</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.400" offset="5796968">Greyhound, according the Government's theory, was in a food company, and the Government's theory was that even though the language of the decree only prohibited Armour from having an interest in the food packing company, more broadly the purpose was to effect a separation between the Meatpackers and the food companies, that the decree was concerned with a relationship and this Court rejected that reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.539" offset="5893517">This Court said no, we think what that consent judgment meant, what that consent judgment meant was that it banned certain action by Armour, taken by Armour and did not ban action taken against Armour by Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.695" offset="5958196">And it's in that context that this Court used the words which are relied on by our components and by lower courts that the meaning of a consent decree must be discerned within it's four corners and the consent judgment must be interpreted as written.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.529" offset="7853537">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.664" offset="7870046">What this case involves is an attempt by the government to secure a retroactive rewriting of a consent decree which prevents only acquisitions, so as to permit the imposition of daily penalties in addition to those that already have been imposed, for something that's not barred by that consent decree, that is the retention of acquisition of access required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.368" offset="7968893">The government's position flies directly in a face in our judgment of the Armour decision of this Court, the Hughes decision, the Atlantic Refining decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.205" offset="8012152">And our case I believe is a fortiori to those cases because contrary to those cases which arose basically in terms of a construction of those consent decrees, here we are dealing with a penalty action in which the government is seeking as I say, retroactively to interpret this consent decree so as to impose multi-millions of dollars of penalties on ITT Continental Baking Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.430" offset="8113089">So the underlying rationale of this Court's decisions prevent that and I think that if that rationale is ever to be applied, it should be applied in this kind of a case where we are dealing not with a prospective interpretation of the consent decree, what does it mean, what we are dealing instead as I say a penalty action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.885" offset="8206921">The government's position and our position would substantially weaken the anti-trust, another enforcement activity because as we all know, much of anti-trust enforcement is conducted by way of consent decrees and consent judgments as true with the STC and other agencies as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.558" offset="8269615">If regarding to now as the government urges you to do to import into consent decrees, vague concepts of purpose, purpose of the underlying Statutes, purpose of the consent decrees, you are going to instead of resolving litigation through consent judgments, you are going to foster litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2838.911" offset="11459062">The question is whether or not at time of suit, there was adverse impact on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.837" offset="11474735">If they were none, I take that there'd be no violation of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.504" offset="11489364">If there were, the routine solution is divestiture to put the industry back to where it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.160" offset="11528025">Now, in our judgment the government position here, as I guess I have suggested violates the two basic principles of consent decree construction, settled by Armour, settled by Hughes and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.461" offset="11613184">One is that the language is to be construed as it's written, it's like a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.315" offset="11640665">And this language is the government really admits in its oral argument, and in its briefs, this language has to be changed in order to support this claim for daily penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.521" offset="11681416">It has to be changed to read beyond acquisition, it has to incorporate the concept of holding and retention, and that is not construing then the consent decree as it was written is construing in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.099" offset="11739721">The second tenant of construction is that this Court's decisions instruct us that you don't as I say look to the purposes underlying the statute or the purposes so called underlined the consent decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.874" offset="11794892">As I have said that the government's position simply doesn't support its claim that you look to our concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.191" offset="11816103">You saw when you concerned about concentration by banning the act of acquisition, that's what this order did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.006" offset="11847346">There is no basis in this record certainly for a so called concern on the part of the government, that if you don't construe this consent order to afford the basis for daily penalties that you are going to have flagrant violations of these consent decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.099" offset="11911816">As Mr. Friedman admitted, as far as everybody knows there is only been two situations like this come up in all of the years of Clayton Act enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.100" offset="11955806">Section 7 as I have said, seems to me to be self enforcing even though the only remedy there is divestiture, And anyway such fears in enforceability or un-enforceability of consent decrees are really irrelevant to how you construe a consent decree. As we struck the bargain in 1962, we labored over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.234" offset="12028322">The government wanted the 20-year ban, we wanted the 5-year ban, we ended up with a 10-year ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.017" offset="12047444">The government wanted to proscribe acquisitions of any companies engaged either in the production or the sale of bread and we didn't want that, because we wanted to be free to buy, acquire companies without violating the order, that were engaged only in the sale of bread, because of that time there were many such independent little companies strung around the country, who were basically one man shows, and who from time to time came to Continental and wanted to be acquired because they were getting old or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.937" offset="12163114">So we bargained for that and we changed the word production or sale in the order to production and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.010" offset="12191431">So these are very important words that we bargained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.988" offset="12215359">As the District Court found this, there was a reasonable basis for reading the order the way we read it, not to ban these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.198" offset="12252139">There is no basis here to say that this was a flagrant violation of this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.575" offset="12269693">As I have said there had been no record except for the Beatrice case of any other situation like this coming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.552" offset="12297592">And moreover these so called fears of the government about flagrant violations continuing can surely be amply accommodated by changing the outstanding orders they have through proper procedures with proper hearings, and by writing new orders which read on the situation as they want this one to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.430" offset="12381080">As I have said that in our judgment, the government's argument here is short sighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.687" offset="12402082">Consent negotiations, consent decrees, and consent judgments are extremely important to the antitrust enforcement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.878" offset="12430921">They are important to the -- I know the SEC and to other government agencies, and if we are going to now import all kinds of vague concepts of purpose into these consent decrees, we are not going to -- we are going to certainly chew any enthusiasm, anybody might have for disposing a litigation and abandoning the right to trial by coming up with a consent disposition of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.141" offset="12539904">The government, turning if I may briefly to the question raised by the government as to whether or not we are permitted or may should be permitted to raise the other issues that we have raised in this case, for many years, at least up through the American Express decision this Court routinely held as consistent with appellate practice, that a party can present any argument in support of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.584" offset="12673755">The government now claims this Court has gone away from that standard and has adopted new standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.279" offset="12704475">Government now claims that we may not without cross-petition for certiorari, may not raise an issue where the logical impact of that issue would be to secure reversal below even though the party isn't asking for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.183" offset="12776155">We have cited the Court to Mr. Stern's article in Harvard Law Review on this matter of practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.803" offset="12890572">He does point out the tremendous burden that would be imposed upon this Court, and upon the Solicitor General's Office, and upon parties if they were required to file what really be useless anticipatory petitions for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.844" offset="12954728">In this case isn't a good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.008" offset="12967372">We do not know that government was going to petition for certiorari until after the period of time expired in which we could petition, because the government, as is not unusual got it an extension of time at the last minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.248" offset="13012407">We got notice of that in the mail after the time had run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.148" offset="13027976">So we didn't have an extension they did, and they filed a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.466" offset="13041246">Now to protect ourselves, we would have been, under the government's interpretation we would have to file a precautionary petition for cert with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.804" offset="13082624">I don't see any real reason to require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.072" offset="13095685">There is no policy judgment that I can figure out that would warrant that because in our response to the government's petition we listed in our brief in opposition, the points that we would raise or feel were relevant, in the event the case came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.674" offset="13154095">The government thereby was not prejudiced when they prepared this brief on the merits, it knows all the issues that we planned to present, it can address itself to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.310" offset="13188577">So I don't think that there is any reason to insist upon these -- really what, without a strict rule of practice would be unnecessary petition for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.478" offset="13557321">Oh yes!</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.138" offset="13563904">We were content to leave the case where it was, it didn't warrant to coming up here for that penalty, that's true and the order had expired, order has long since expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.454" offset="13609148">There was no continuing dispute here that warranted our seeking this Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.035" offset="13635480">As I say that the issues we are seeking to present in our judgment are cert worthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.219" offset="13656273">It is a requirements contract normally thought of if at all under Section 3 of the Clayton Act, is that an acquisition of the sort that Section 7 of Clayton Act reads on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.412" offset="13697024">Is the commission permitted to reach a conclusion that a party is incurring daily penalties of up to ten thousand, in this case thirty thousand dollars per day because the statute has been amended, is it permitted to do that without putting the party, the respondent on notice that it is in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.116" offset="13779884">I think that is a very serious issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.473" offset="13789288">Several District Courts have agreed with us on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.734" offset="13798275">I think it's clearly an important issue for this Court to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.340" offset="13808724">If it disagrees with us that daily penalties may be imposed here, if the Court doesn't -- if the Court in other words adheres to Armour and adheres to Hughes and Atlantic Refining and the others, of course these issue are not reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.405" offset="13869014">It's only if the Court should disagree with us and conclude that daily penalties may be asserted, then we feel that the question has to be reached that was there a violation here, is the Commission permitted simply the stand lightly by and let a respondent pile up penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.638" offset="13929932">And thirdly, is ITT Continental Baking Company a successor of Continental where there is in the consent order no successors and assigns language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.927" offset="13975071">Armour of course flatly says, that where there is no successors and assigns language in a consent decree, the decree is not binding on successors and assigns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.387" offset="14056887">In their complaint they asked for thousand dollars a day, Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.565" offset="14073605">The Court, for reasons that were not stated assigned to penalty of five thousand a day for one days violation for two different transactions, without an amendment to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.062" offset="14127626">We did not oppose that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.941" offset="14131179">I think, frankly I think the government could have put in a proforma complaint amendment and cured that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.271" offset="14156466">The statute now permits ten thousands dollars per day, it's been amended since.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.416" offset="14173080">Now, if that amended provision is applicable to this case and I suppose it is retroactive, you are looking at a possible penalty claim of upwards of twenty millions of dollars in this case.</text>
