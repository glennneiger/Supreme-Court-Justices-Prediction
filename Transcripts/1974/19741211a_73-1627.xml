            <text syncTime="39.170" offset="260054">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.271" offset="276459">The issue presented by this case is the exact same issue which the Court reserved to itself from the case of McMann against Richardson in 397 U.S. at footnote 13 of its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.916" offset="327032">And that question is whether the federal habeas corpus remedy is available to a defendant who pleads guilty, whether it is permitted under state law to appeal the denial of a pretrial motion to suppress evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.188" offset="392129">In February of 1970, Mr. Newsome was arrested for loitering.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.324" offset="416684">Loitering is a violation carrying a maximum 15 days imprisonment sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.483" offset="445315">Incidental to this loitering arrest, Mr. Newsome was searched and it appeared that on his person were concealed narcotics and narcotic implements so that he was also charged with the crime of possession of a dangerous drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.095" offset="515741">This was a Class A misdemeanor, carrying a maximum one year imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.819" offset="550640">A trial on the loitering charge was combined with a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.145" offset="580002">The defendant contended that the loitering arrest which predicated the incidental search was invalid and that the loitering statute was unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.950" offset="635173">The lower criminal court denied this motion and convicted him of loitering.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.869" offset="662862">At that point, in May of 1970, the defendant pleaded guilty to a reduced charged of attempted possession of a dangerous drug and he was sentenced to three months imprisonment, which was the maximum on the so-called Class B misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.743" offset="738304">At that point under what was then Section 813-c of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure, he appealed, he was enlarged on bail and has remained free ever since.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.647" offset="5942000">I hope you won't think it overly blunt for me to state something or rather firmly at the outset, I think a reversal here would require this Court to put a revolutionary gloss on a very stagy concept of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.998" offset="6011382">The petitioner, although he hasn't used the magic word waiver is essentially asking you to find a waiver in unprecedented context, a context unlike all other cases where there has been some sort of default, some sort of lapse, some sort of relinquishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.878" offset="6074911">Petitioner is asking you to find a waiver of a constitutional claim in this case and the opportunity to vindicate that claim under the habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.187" offset="6112110">Even though he has fully litigated that claim in perfect and timely accord with every inch and paragraph of the state statue and it seems to me rather anomalous that they could achieve that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.989" offset="6179297">The petitioner attributes this waiver of habeas corpus vindication to a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.845" offset="6202702">Automatically, he is saying the guilty plea dispatches with federal habeas remedies and this is the same guilty plea that does not waive under the state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.276" offset="6260485">It is the same guilty plea which petitioner conceded to page 13 of his brief and just reiterate the concessions from Mr. Justice White, does not waive certiorari prerogative, yet we're told that the same plea waives the mandatory statute -- statutory relief provided by Congress in the habeas corpus statue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.395" offset="6484929">The constant for habeas corpus relief is simply that the constitutional claim be presented to state court and by whatever procedure that the state court is erected for that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.949" offset="12423189">-- before you start with you reply, I was interested in the fact that counsel for correspondents spent a good deal of his time arguing the benefits to the state of New York this statute in that it encourages guilty pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.519" offset="12489435">You are here representing the Attorney General of New York, what do you have to say to that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Hammer</label>
            <text syncTime="3104.540" offset="12521514">I would submit Your Honor that the while the statute thus confer reciprocal benefits upon both the people and the defendant, however, the considerations underlying the enactment of such a statute are in view completely immaterial to the legal question at bar and that is what is the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.941" offset="12627153">And it’s our contention that the state legislature regardless of the considerations has absolutely nothing to do with establishing or amending or creating jurisdiction in the District Court, it can’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.893" offset="12694967">Only Congress and with this Court interpreting the statutes of Congress can affect the District Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.268" offset="12740420">I would like to re-emphasize that waiver is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.123" offset="12759855">The plea of guilty forms the independent basis for the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.770" offset="12778454">In fact McMann itself is not a waiver case since it dealt with the substantive law on when a guilty plea may be impeached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.077" offset="12819728">The decision of this Court in Boykin doesn't -- has nothing to say about that a guilty plea will be overturned if the defendant isn't advised that he has or has not the right to go into the District Court for federal habeas corpus ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.220" offset="12916276">In the case of Man against Smith, although the procedure in California is slightly different than that in New York, the operative fact here is the guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.411" offset="12981060">The -- the respondent's attorney made much of the fact that the alleged anomaly in this court's -- this court's certiorari jurisdiction direct from the state courts and our contention that the District Court lacks jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.324" offset="13072697">The statutes are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.855" offset="13082833">2254 (d) has nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.251" offset="13096417">The question is whether there is a violation of a federal right under 22-41 (c) 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.163" offset="13127973">Of course since this Court on certiorari considers only cases of national significance, the overall intrusive effect onto state criminal law process will be much less than if there is original jurisdiction in the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.028" offset="13207489">Counsel spoke of springing the trap because we never talked about the Second Circuit's ruling in Rogers in the state courts, simple answer is we had no occasion to that was not known at the time and couldn't possibly be known what the defendants intentions were in the event his state appeals went against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.677" offset="13314069">As for the expectations of the state, the expectation is very simple, to give the defendant a state appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.121" offset="13359835">All that -- that's all the state intended, that's all the defendant could possibly expect, could reasonably expect in the light of the state statute and of course the reenactment of these statute in the light of the alleged light of the Second Circuit rulings, we would regard as being not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.141" offset="13463907">It's our view Your Honors that the logic of the McMann case, of Tollet, of Blackledge requires a reversal in this action and we respectfully so submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.141" offset="13519914">Thank you Your Honors.</text>
