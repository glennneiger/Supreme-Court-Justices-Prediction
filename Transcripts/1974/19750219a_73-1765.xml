            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="53.968" offset="319195">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.755" offset="338422">This case is a challenge to three statutes enacted by the State of Pennsylvania in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.875" offset="398921">This Court in 1971, in the case of Lemon against Kurtzman had previously declared unconstitutional a statute providing for the purchase of secular services by nonpublic schools and the Court held at that violated the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.591" offset="481782">Thereafter, the District Court in the East District of Pennsylvania held unconstitutional another statute and which provided for reimbursement for tuition paid by parents for their children attending nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.936" offset="571120">Now, it declared unconstitutional as the violation of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.066" offset="587630">And while that case was pending before this Court in appeal to this Court, the Pennsylvania legislature acted a package of three statutes, Acts 194, 195 and 204.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.564" offset="653667">Now, Act 204 can be told very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.457" offset="673207">It increased the amount which had originally been appropriated for the tuition grants payment although the law had already been declared unconstitutional by this District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.415" offset="729004">However, that case is now moot, that part of our complaint is now moot because this Court affirmed the District Court, so that part of the complaint which we alleged is now moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.462" offset="777174">But before this Court is the constitutionality of Acts 194 and 195.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.362" offset="812805">Briefly, Act 194 provides for financing our tax rates funds are what are called auxiliary services in nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.654" offset="862020">I don't want to spend time reading the definition that is contained in the -- jurisdictions contained the appendix contained on page four of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.565" offset="929625">Act 195 has three separate provisions, all providing for tax support of services in nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.373" offset="988871">One provision provide for textbooks, another for instructional materials and the third for instructional equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.369" offset="1028890">The definitions of each are in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.265" offset="1048430">Now, the amounts appropriated in 1972 was $31 million and then the following year it was increased to $35 million per year, which it is now subject to further increases which we may assume will take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.017" offset="1143411">The District Court, in a vote of two to one upheld the constitutionality of the auxiliary services provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.592" offset="1201716">Unanimously, although Judge Higginbotham was quite reluctant, obviously reluctant to go along, but he did, for reasons which I frankly I'm not able to understand, upheld the constitutionality of the textbook provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.583" offset="1261693">On the instructional materials again we had a two to one split with Judge Higginbotham dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.029" offset="1291473">In the instructional equipment we have a sort of a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.809" offset="1310595">Part of the statute was declared unconstitutional unanimously, and part of it was declared constitutional in respect to and this Court read this into the statute to such instructional equipment which from its nature cannot be readily diverted to religious purposes and is particularly designed or designated for secular educational purposes preferred for under statute and is duly promulgated guides for the administration of such statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.921" offset="1451029">Now, as far as the appellants are concerned there are no contested fact situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.306" offset="1484570">We believe the statute on the basis of the decisions of this Court is unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.500" offset="1517380">We would like to put this case in proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.792" offset="1534516">We do not challenge the right of pupils in nonpublic schools to obtain these services, all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.817" offset="1586657">We challenge the right to obtain these services as part of the overall program of religious education in religious school.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.838" offset="1626676">Now we concede, we recognize that it is more convenient to bring the service to the children than to have the children come to the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.172" offset="1668054">We are not talking about, requiring children to enroll in public schools a complete program, but to come to the public schools for these additional services benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.887" offset="1710895">I will recognize that it is more convenient the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.056" offset="1723643">But their contention that the values protected by the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment which is caught spelled out and emphasized again in Wisconsin against Yoder, and again in the Nyquist case last year that these values are so dominant in our democratic concept in hierarchy of values that the inevitable somewhat were inconvenient method of delivering these services requiring the children to come to the religious schools that they do in release time practices which this Court upheld in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.440" offset="1917158">Now that is undoubtedly less convenient in other way, but the highest state which both the free exercise and the Establishment Clauses as the Court pointed out which is held in our heart of values requires this somewhat modest sacrifice.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.497" offset="2013393">Now, there's another fact which we deem of vital importance and we deem maybe the heart of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.169" offset="2052054">Now this case does not come to this Court as tabula rasa which faces the nature of the educational system at Pennsylvania and the relationship of the nonpublic -- public schools and the religious schools, among the nonpublic schools with before this Court in Lemon against Kurtzman and then again in the Sloan against Lemon.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.462" offset="2137213">It is uncontested, this was uncontested that in administering the law, we have the appendix citation page A47 or 48 the commissioner of who is -- had the obligation and force will agree that in administering the law there are certain eligibility requirements, requiring the curriculum of the school and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.053" offset="2243584">But not included in these eligibility requirements and not deemed to be disabling is the fact for example that the schools restrict admissions on the basis of religion or that the schools require all students to participate in religious instruction as condition for their continuance in the school, or that the schools serve a major religious purpose in their functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.733" offset="2378271">Now, the State of Pennsylvania takes a position that these are not the stabling factors, that notwithstanding these facts, the schools and the students attending those schools are entitled to the food benefits of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.693" offset="2474193">Now, there's one constitutional provision as one which to me is as close to a categorical imperative in constitutional as we can get to.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.250" offset="2540335">I submit that whether you look at it from the First Amendment, the Fifth, the Ninth or the Fourteenth, it is simply not within the concept of our constitutional concepts of our constitutional dictations that a service which is financed with funds raised through compulsory taxation of all citizens from such service and these citizens can be bared because of his religion and because of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.635" offset="2677948">This is as close to a categorical imperative, I can see, and only second to that is that such a school can condition participation in the benefits universally financed upon the students participating in religious services or religious sectarian instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.310" offset="2792573">This is if Your Honors please to me the heart of this case, and as I say it is close as I can see to it categorical imperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.044" offset="2839594">The Court pointed that out in Norwood against Harrison in which it held that textbooks to one of the provisions of our law and one as Act 195 could not be appropriate, could not be sent to private schools which discriminates on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.692" offset="2954115">And in Norwood against Harrison, the Court pointed out to the dissenting or partly dissenting partly concurrent opinion of Mr. Justice White in the Lemon against Kurtzman case that if a school discriminates or restricts admissions either on race or religion or requires participation of sectarian instruction students that the services such as textbooks or other services, and the Norwood case dealt with textbooks, could not be made available in that school.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.567" offset="3129657">So that it is our opinion, it is our view that on the basis of that alone, of that principle, the constitutionality of this statute cannot be held as interpreted in the previous cases of Lemon v. Kurtzman and Sloan against Lemon.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.741" offset="3210324">Now, between the time that the District Court handed down its decision in our case and the time, the present time this Court affirmed petition of a District Court from the Third Circuit in New Jersey in the case of Marburger against Public Funds for Public Schools, and the Supreme Court has since then affirmed per curiam that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.224" offset="3352221">Now, the statute in that case, in the Marburger case, as far as I can read is there are some differences in detail, which I believe are secondary as far as the constitutional issue is concerned presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.178" offset="3424110">I do not recognize, I do not see any significant constitutional difference between the statute and in New Jersey and the statute of Pennsylvania, they came of the same pattern and the language is in the most of the statute, the language is identical, the words are identical, the setup is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.254" offset="3520345">They freely throw off practical purposes as far as they are identical statutes and --</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.134" offset="5247875">We do not have to find that this teacher or that teacher did actually use her or his position to advance religious values.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="1888.933" offset="7659081">The answers is the discriminations is this that it is certain within the discretion of the school board to say “We will use text A rather than B and the student who like to use text B rather than text A has no constitutional agreement” unless, unless the only reason he is barred from using textbook B is because of his race of his color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.881" offset="7746853">That's what Norwood against Harrison held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.240" offset="7760332">He is not -- there's no question that schools have power to determine which textbooks can be used, but it's our contention, they cannot exercise that power on the basis of the religion of the students, and the requirement that the students participate in religious instructions to get access for that textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.538" offset="7837550">That is the constitutional wall between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.886" offset="7854895">Now, so much for the textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.452" offset="7873181">Now on instructional materials, again it is our contention that the instruction materials in order to make sure that this is not used for religious purposes, there must be that surveillance where this First Amendment forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.375" offset="7976835">And the interesting effect is that you cannot rely upon the constitutional permits reliability upon the good faith of the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.632" offset="8025945">That's what this Court held time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.061" offset="8035662">The interesting part about this is that the District Court itself that the District Court itself recognized that merely reliance upon the good faith of the teachers is not enough, because in respect to instructionally equipment, they tried to make a distinction between instructional -- was it readily usable for religious purposes and one which is not readily usable for the religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.204" offset="8148198">Now, if you rely, if the constitution permits reliance on the good faith of the teachers, then this distinction is meaningless and the appellants in this case have not appealed from that part of the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.521" offset="8213504">Why do we rely on the teacher's good faith and in auxiliary services that as the State of Pennsylvania asked us to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.600" offset="8253733">Why are we asked to rely upon the good faith of the teacher in respect to auxiliary services when the District Court agreed you cannot rely upon their good faith in respect to instructional equipment, and therefore bars the use of instructional equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.719" offset="8314232">We -- it is our -- the instructional equipment which is allegedly not readably usable for religious purposes, it is our contention that is a very all official distinction and that with any degree of revolves from this packing anything can be use for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.059" offset="8391659">We've given examples in our brief and in the decision before this Court, previous decisions, the Court for example in the Levitt case -- no in the part one of Nyquist, which held unconstitutional a law providing funds for the maintenance repair, a pro rata of school equipment and school planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.278" offset="8520495">And the court said “If the building is heated there's no way of shutting off the heat from the classroom in which religion is taught, or the light.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.171" offset="8564067">You simply -- the education system is such that such a differentiation is all official and impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.992" offset="8607326">All you can only assure compliance with the Establishment Clause by that surveillance, which as I've indicated before, is forbidden by the entanglement aspect of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.129" offset="8707845">As the Court earlier said there is a Scylla and Charybdis here which is simply unmanageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.360" offset="8740864">The Court has said, an in all these cases which are referred to that they've gone -- allowed textbooks, allowed bus transportation in Everson in 1947 and even then, the Court said “This verges upon the unconstitutional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.037" offset="8815470">They allow it over the strong center for the justices and the justice who wrote the opinion Mr. Justice Black has never gone beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.574" offset="8857684">And finally, in 1968 the Allen case and said, “Okay, this verge is beyond.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.392" offset="8892897">The want that step, but it in the cases which I've cited and each of those cases, and particularly the Nyquist case and the Sloan case, alleged the court this said “We're not going to even approach that verge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.328" offset="8944724">We're not going to do anymore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.232" offset="8952351">Because the verge itself is a difficult line to draw and the values of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment are so high that we cannot tamper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.724" offset="9026226">We cannot tamper or risk the violations of those values or the -- by these such statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.531" offset="9069484">In the Yoder case, which I believe my brother Mr. Ball argued before this Court, the Court said that while a secondary education is of high value and the state has an interest in seeing towards that all its citizens obtain, the secretary as well as primary education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.186" offset="9180139">It is not high enough, it does not high enough to outweigh the values of the religion clause and in the Yoder case appoint said “Use both the religion and Establishment Clause --“</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Ball</label>
            <text syncTime="2321.076" offset="9387656">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.395" offset="9412942">We are going to have a division of argument among the co-counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.349" offset="9424750">I'll address myself principally to Act 194, the auxiliary services Act, and Mr. Blewitt for the commonwealth is going to concentrate mainly on Act 195, and Mr. Reath is going to discuss various related aspects of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.485" offset="9509282">For years the state educational authorities in the various states have recognized that there are individual children in the schools who need special help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.227" offset="9568319">And in response to this, the states have provided and identified certain kinds of services which can help these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.723" offset="9614294">Now many of these relate to health, while others relate to learning disabilities and they all interrelate in a school situation, first, because that's where the learning takes place and that's the place which is most useful to afford services for the correction of deficiencies or the affording of health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.028" offset="9711470">And I might mention also that these services are also very much tied into aid to families.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.466" offset="9745220">If it please the Court, we have in this chamber this very moment a child to whom we refer in footnote 5 of our brief, a little girl named Janna Bents who had a 95% decibel loss of hearing, she is deaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.832" offset="9818676">This related intimately to the fact that she could not well carry any kind of learning process and thirdly, these had all manner of repercussions on the life of the family quite obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.065" offset="9875623">Now, these services have been known as adjunct services they've been called or auxiliary services, supportive services and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.652" offset="9913971">Ten years ago the Congress of the United States in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, spoke of specialized services and identified them for the benefit of all children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.762" offset="9962454">Pennsylvania for years had been furnishing auxiliary services to children in the public schools of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.727" offset="9990248">In 1972 they made this program general by including all children under the benefits of auxiliary services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.125" offset="10031835">I'm going to discuss the auxiliary services program in detail in a moment because I think a great deal needs to be said with respect to facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.392" offset="10068929">Preliminarily however, I want to divert the -- a line of my argument to go in to the matter of the trial which forms the record upon which the judgment of the court below was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.694" offset="10134131">I think that's important to do Your Honors, because the programs have been attacked largely on presumptions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.425" offset="10177076">Presumptions with respect to the administration of the act and how it works, presumptions with respect to employees of the state who carry out the act and how they behave and presumptions with respect to religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.935" offset="10239143">We knew at the beginning of this litigation that these allegations and assertions were totally at variants with reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.260" offset="10284387">And therefore, we decided that the prudent thing from the point of view of our case and the best way to achieve justice would be to put the program on the stand, and then let the eminent counsel for the plaintiffs have that witnesses, live witnesses not stipulated facts that can't be cross-examined but put on the stand parents, put on the stand administrators, put on the stand teachers who carry out the program and then permit their credibility to be gone after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.461" offset="10417194">If they weren't credible let it be shown, if they were not typical let that be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.201" offset="10436211">If they were highly selective and not typical let that be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.703" offset="10454183">But, here with -- at counsel tap what was indicated to be a simply an ocean of universally accepted fact about all these matters, when the time came to bring on the tidal wave of fact and get away from the world of presumption, the plaintiffs came up bone dry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.876" offset="10546866">They declined to cross-examine a single witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.339" offset="10560763">They did not put on one piece of evidence or one witness rather, to contradict what we through our witnesses we think had established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.619" offset="10605798">Now, the significance of that is this, if it pleases the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.473" offset="10621262">I think the plaintiffs are asking the Court to ignore facts and to ignore this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.468" offset="10641220">How little in fact zero discussion we have heard just now of this record, and to follow, they beckoned the Court to follow them in to a neverland where valuable social programs maybe comfortably disposed of by talk of potential, of danger, of values, of likelihood of it maybe just that in substitution for fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.413" offset="10749053">May I now cover Act 194 under three headings?</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.820" offset="10766608">First of all with respect to its subject matter then with respect to its administration and then with respect to its teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.630" offset="10801925">The subject matter is the services, services directly to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.753" offset="10826376">None of these services are required under Pennsylvania's compulsory attendance law, and therefore a school affording these services does not by that fact qualify as a compulsory attendance school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.782" offset="10890533">The services of their nature by statute and by practice are secular, are neutral, are none ideological.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.039" offset="11371499">We do not in the least challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.975" offset="11387277">Coming to the administration of these services; oh by the way, I ought to mention one thing before passing to that, Mr. Pfeffer had stated in this argument now that the provision of the guideline which speaks of bringing below grade children to grade levels status, act equals in effect the affording of normal services by the nonpublic school through the services of the intermediate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.378" offset="11524890">The court below faced that and we have alluded to that at page 16 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.995" offset="11547355">The court found that contention to be without substance and it did so on the following grounds that first of all auxiliary services are by and large not mandated as part of basic curriculum in Pennsylvania, and this we have shown by the regulations of the State Board of Education which we cite at page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.107" offset="11627813">By and large, the services are totally new to nonpublic school children, a fact which also the general assembly very clearly declared in this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.698" offset="11670131">And if you read this to mean that these services are simply ordinary general services of the schools we have contradicted any meaning which the general assembly and the department of education have given to the term of auxiliary services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.096" offset="11747767">In administering the Act, we come to the year 1970 in which the commonwealth enacted into law the Intermediate Unit Services Act, this was well prior to the existence of the present legislation that I'm discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.569" offset="11809625">This created 29 entities in the state which would afford technical and planning services to clusters of public school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.750" offset="11846405">And it is this -- and a unit of the public educational system which administers this Act, it does so and administers the Act on the premises of the nonpublic schools first of all because this affording of auxiliary services had always been presented in that way on the premises of the school where the child is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.045" offset="11939506">Secondly, it's clear that it is the only place in which these services can be usefully and meaningfully afforded to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.549" offset="11981615">The testimony that we have in the record from Dr. Horrowitz who for ten years has been administering ESCA services to nonpublic school children on nonpublic school premises and who was also been the administrator of Act 194 in the school district of Philadelphia, which is also the intermediate unit of the city of Philadelphia, is very eloquent to the fact that logistics, the transporting of children are very much greatly impede any chance of meaningfully affording these services to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.729" offset="12134275">One witness, Mrs. Stopper, a speech therapist in the Carbon Lehigh Union Intermediate Unit testified that the fact that because of these kinds of difficulties, and the case loads of people in public schools it had not been possible to afford auxiliary services to 17 out of 350 children needing speech therapy services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.852" offset="12230823">Now counsel speaks of a modest sacrifice in the transporting of children to get these services else where, we ask the Court to look at the record, the testimony in particular of Dr. Horrowitz as flatly contradicting any assertion that this is a modest sacrifice and is not indeed a prime means of defeating the benefits which this Act recognizes, and public policy recognizes that all children need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.883" offset="12362898">The intermediate units administer the Act through commonwealth personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.177" offset="12392051">There are people who are under the direct supervision and control of the public intermediate units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.063" offset="12419636">They are bound down by the school laws of Pennsylvania, the regulations of the State Board of Education and the directives of the intermediate units which extensively and intensively regulate the conduct of the intermediate unit employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.779" offset="12490480">They must be properly certified according to Pennsylvania Code Section 49.11.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.118" offset="12523813">Now we come to the contention that the people who furnish intermediate unit services create religious problems and that this programs does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.910" offset="12619003">Yet when we go the record in the case, we find not a single instance brought to the attention of the Court wherein one individual has abused his office as a public employee in seeking to “teach religion in the course of the performance of his professional duties.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.388" offset="12700923">On the other hand, we have positive, unquestioned and uncontradicted testimony to precisely the opposite effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.794" offset="12738539">Dr. Horrowitz within ten years administering ESEA programs on nonpublic school premises testified flatly the he knew of no incident of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.639" offset="12789948">The other witnesses who have testified as to the administration of the act testified similarly and not one word of evidence disposes in a state of 67 counties, 29 intermediate units and a program that is been going on since 1972, any instance of this horrible to which counsel alludes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.341" offset="12872704">We are here impressed by the quotation by Mr. Justice Powell in Nyquist, in which he quotes from Allen saying that absence, absent evidence we cannot assume that school authorities are enabled to distinguish between secular and religious books or that they will not honestly discharge their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.508" offset="12985448">There is nothing either to show that these people who perform for the intermediate units go through the experience which was assumed in Marburger, as they go through of becoming susceptible and contracting religion when they enter upon the premises of a religious school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.392" offset="13064965">There is nothing in the record to indicate that any one of these people, these many employees are so mentally dimmed that they can not understand the regulation under which they are supposed to operate, that they're so psychologically weak, they can not help but be overcome by a supposed and unproved dominant religious atmosphere in a religious school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.946" offset="13155140">That they are so professionally shoddy that they will throw there professional ethics to the whims in order to divert into some religion or other, that they are so lawless that they will deliberately violate the law of their state and their nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3781.296" offset="15228531">I would like to begin my argument by stating what I consider to be two basic principles that have run through all of this Courts decisions under the Establishment Clause as they relate to education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.096" offset="15291747">First is that the state has a recognized interest in the quality of secular education in all nonpublic schools and the second general observation is that some form of state aid can be directed to the secular function of the religious school without providing there by direct aid to the religious functions of such schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.389" offset="15376906">This theme has been restated in every Establishment Clause case which has come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.040" offset="15407522">Now the question then is does Act 195 meets this test?</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.827" offset="15430719">Well answering that question I would like to address myself to what is being provided by the enactment and I feel that I by focusing on what is provided the Court will see that this enactment passes both the entanglement and primary effect test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.792" offset="15498533">What is provided are three types of educational aids' textbooks, educational materials and instructional equipment, a very limited type of instructional equipment I must mention, slide projectors, record players, instructional equipment of such form is not permissible by virtue of the District Court's order and by virtue of the amended guideline which we have submitted to replace the original guideline which did authorize that equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.423" offset="15625070">Now there are the three types of equipment, the three types of educational aids but in addition these educational aids have two characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.278" offset="15664462">First they must be secular, second as to textbooks they must be acceptable for use in a public school and as for instructional equipment and materials they must be such as that are provided in nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.207" offset="15720155">So I think it is important to emphasize that the outset the plaintiffs don't even claim, much less make any attempt to prove that any form of religious material is being provided under these Acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3960.850" offset="15946794">We adopted, by not appealing, we have adopted that that standard fixed by the District Court and we think it a healthy standard because the District Court has fashioned a concept of a self-policing educational aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.745" offset="16006353">One can look at the aid and determine merely by looking at it whether or not it can perform any sort of religious function.</text>

            <text syncTime="4046.370" offset="16288893">But I think the point of Allen was that the officials who must make the decision as to what is loaned are public officials and deciding whether to -- whether a given educational aid is permissible can be loaned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.074" offset="16363708">But the public school officials making the very same decision that he makes all the time in deciding what materials can be loaned to a public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.672" offset="16398085">In essence the school official is really making one decision no matter where the request for the educational aid comes from, whether the request comes from a public school principal or from the nonpublic schools, he is making one decision, is this acceptable for use in public schools?</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.988" offset="16467362">There is nothing in this record to suggest that public school officials will not honestly discharge there duty or there unable to distinguish between religious and secular materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.249" offset="16520338">So I think it is important that what we are here providing is tangible educational aids.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.737" offset="16542281">Their content is ascertainable in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.774" offset="16554506">The aids themselves by there very nature, and by virtue of the necessary prior approval of the public school authorities cannot be diverted to a religious use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.600" offset="16597765">They are self-policing and I think this, the concept of self-policing is not only important, but essential to our case for the concept of self-policing in and of itself answers two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.645" offset="16645935">It answers the primary effect question and the entanglement question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.724" offset="16662235">Because the material cannot be used for religious purpose then it is being restricted exclusively to a secular use and therefore there is no danger of a primary effect of advancing religion because the --</text>

            <text syncTime="4300.518" offset="17305475">Well it certainly is not class legislation because what is being provided here for the nonpublic school students is being provided through other provisions of the public school code for public school students.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.604" offset="17381752">This Court in Nyquist recognized that direct aid in any form is invalid absent affective means of assuring that the – whether this loan would be used exclusively for a secular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.427" offset="17433057">Here the guarantee comes from the nature of the equipment loaned.</text>

            <text syncTime="4358.566" offset="17537651">And of course they trouble with money probably its only trouble, is that money -- when money is provided it must carry with it restrictions on its use.</text>

            <text syncTime="4457.603" offset="17933772">This Court in Tilton recognized that a possibility always exists of a law's legitimate purposes being subverted by conscious design or lacks enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4494.714" offset="18082252">I would like in a few minutes left to me to first restate the issue which I think has been fully argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.566" offset="18109628">And the issue is should this Court exercise its admitted power to invalidate a state action where the legislation under attack has to proven primary purpose and effect of improving children's learning and communication skills and where there is no disqualifying provision in the statute, denying such benefits to children attending religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.981" offset="18223313">I appear this afternoon, if Your Honors please, on behalf of two parents and two children attending private independent schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.470" offset="18257272">I also serve as counsel for the Pennsylvania Association of Independent Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.389" offset="18276916">I'm appearing essentially as the spokesman for the independent schools and at this time I would like to say I of course join in the arguments made by predecessors, and I also join in the brief that was the amicus brief filed by the counsel for American Private Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.087" offset="18351731">I don't think I need to take this Court's time to dwell or emphasize some basic constitutional principles which is that there is a strong presumption of validity to the propriety of state action and that one who seeks to overturn it has a very heavy burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.452" offset="18425187">And I believe based on the arguments that Mr. Ball and Mr. Blewitt have made that it has been shown how they have utterly failed to meet this burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.842" offset="18466774">They have offered no evidence whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.416" offset="18480985">Mr. Pfeffer in his argument made a charge which I submit was totally unwanted and not in this record, a charge of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.548" offset="18517556">There is no evidence of discrimination in this record and that is fully developed in our brief at page 19 and I won't take my valuable time now to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.876" offset="18554859">Secondly, as far as the availability of these auxiliary services are concerned under the present statute, they are now equally available to children in parochial schools, in private schools or in public schools and there is complete and total freedom of choice among the children as to which of those school systems that they would use to avail themselves to those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.323" offset="18660707">Secondly, if Your Honor please, and I think that this is very clear, I've referred to it at page 13 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.870" offset="18694875">In Everson, the Court had this very issue before it where the question was whether or not the State of New Jersey could exclude the benefits -- certain benefits to children in religious schools and here is what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.615" offset="18761853">“While we do not mean to intimate that a state could not provide transportation only to children attending public schools, we must be careful in protecting the citizens of New Jersey against state established churches to be sure that we will not inadvertently prohibit New Jersey from extending its general state law benefits to all its citizens without regard of their religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.209" offset="18872195">And the record shows here an equivocally that these are general state benefits now offered to all children regardless of their race, religion, color or creed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.923" offset="18915035">Finally, I would submit and again I've developed this argument at page 35 of our brief and I incorporated in my argument that it would be impermissible and highly unconstitutional for Pennsylvania to attempt to inquire into the religious practices or beliefs of any child in order to determine whether that child was eligible to receive the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.773" offset="19010435">It would be a denial of the equal protection at the free exercise arguments which these plaintiffs seemed to claim to represent in attacking this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.322" offset="19060694">Now if Your Honor please, I would like next to very briefly refer to this Court's decision in Pearl v. Nyquist and Lemon v. Sloan because I would submit that that is our point of departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.447" offset="19133210">And this Court in an opinion for the Court by Mr. Justice Powell, held and struck down tuition reimbursement and tax credit because it was felt that this conferred in some fashion or rather a special benefit on children and parents who were attending religious schools and thus have the disqualifying effect of being, having a primary purpose of aiding religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.504" offset="19249403">At the same time, the Court in Mr. Justice Powell's opinion rebuffed the very same arguments that are being advanced here and have been advanced before and that is there must be an absolute wall of separation and that there must be an absolute ban on the provision of any form of public aid to nonpublic education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.803" offset="19346578">And there the majority held that aid still can be channeled albeit it may be a narrow channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.101" offset="19375731">Happily this Court did give us some aids to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.440" offset="19393181">And the aids to navigation I believe were these; one to pass muster it must not be class legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.008" offset="19423378">It must be something available equally to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.412" offset="19437066">Two; it must be neutral non-ideological.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.850" offset="19454725">Three; it must be indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.284" offset="19464547">Four; it must be of only of incidental benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.942" offset="19483146">I submit that Pennsylvania Acts 194 and 195 in all respects stay within the narrow channel prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.079" offset="19519718">It is not class legislation, it benefits all children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.814" offset="19538631">It is neutral and non-ideological.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.826" offset="19550647">It deals with the tools for learning and the ability to improve ones communication and learning skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.494" offset="19585337">It is indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.030" offset="19591502">No payments are made to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.006" offset="19599444">The benefits are given to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.394" offset="19616998">There is no real benefit to the school directly because at most it could be deemed incidental in that, again the benefit goes to the children and not to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.690" offset="19670183">It is self-policing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.995" offset="19675303">There is no problem of entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.277" offset="19684498">A perfect example of that Mr. Chief Justice to elaborate a question Your Honor asked earlier was that this Court, the lower court said for example “We will not permit you to lend moving picture projectors because a moving a projector could be used to show a religious film.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.111" offset="19759835">So that those are out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.558" offset="19765582">Any kind of a training aid that could lend itself to be used to for religious purpose is excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.113" offset="19787839">What is left is only a self-policing type of auxiliary teaching material or a textbook or a service that deals not with the core of the educational program, but deals with such things as remedial reading to improve the learning skills and the communication skills of our children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.686" offset="19874147">And I submit therefore that in all respects, we have met the test of the Nyquist case and the Chief Justice's admonishing in Lemon v. Kurtzman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.080" offset="19923675">There are in Acts 194 and 195 none of the evils which this Court has been concerned about, the evils of sponsorship, financial support or active involvement by the sovereign in religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.663" offset="19993997">In conclusion, I'd like to say this Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.417" offset="20005073">I think that we in this country have placed a very high priority on the role of education and the role of our judiciary in preserving and strengthening a free democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.613" offset="20061811">As to the role of education, I would submit that we state the very survival of the republic on illiterate, educated, informed and hopefully enlightened citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.376" offset="20128893">We have had a love affair in this country with education and rightly so because through education it makes us free.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.233" offset="20164315">At page 10, I have a quotation in my brief the only one I want to read from Lord Braum Henry Peter, the eminent English statesman, jurist and scientist where he said, “Education makes a people easy to lead, but difficult to drive, easy to govern but impossible to enslave.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.576" offset="20253654">Secondly as to the role of the judiciary, recent events and a landmark decision by this Court have highlighted the critical role of the judiciary as the fulcrum in disputes between branches of government and between the people and government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.105" offset="20323767">And to perform this function of necessity, it has and it must have great power, including the power to invalidate state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.055" offset="20363577">But I would submit that matters involving state action it must be -- this power must be used sparingly and particularly in matters of state action only where there is a clearly proved and patent infringement of constitutional rights not found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.928" offset="20443094">In respect of state action, we are now witnessing and in large measure spurred on by this Court's decision in Baker v. Carr and its progeny, the development of what might be called a new federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.615" offset="20501817">A return swing of the pendulum which recognizes that we're going to put more of responsibility and power on the individual states to work out in harmony with the federal government to solve the vexing problems that beset our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.586" offset="20565765">And I submit this is good and it should be encouraged for only by trial and error by the process of experimentation, can we chart a safe course that will give us the answer to constitutionally valid tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.035" offset="20627519">The people of Pennsylvania through their duly elected representatives have determined that this form of legislation is desirable to strengthen their commitment to the working of free democracy to education, to enable these children to have the learning skills and the communication skills that they need.</text>
            <text syncTime="5151.091" offset="20707767">Anyone who would deny the -- and I submit that this is proper, anyone who would deny the power of the states to do this has a very heavy burden and that burden I submit has not been met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.142" offset="20759907">We ask Your Honorable Court to deny the appeal and to affirm the judgment of the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="5181.609" offset="20829811">Mr. Chief Justice and Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.680" offset="20846111">I would like to devote the minutes that I have to attempting to answer some of the questions that have been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.056" offset="20871607">First of all I believe it was Mr. Justice Stewart who asked the question as to how the Allen statute could be distinguished from the Pennsylvania statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.352" offset="20912776">There is a very real distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.019" offset="20919463">In the Allen case, the statute provided for the loan of textbooks, free textbooks to all school children in the State of New York, both public and nonpublic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.738" offset="20966275">Act 195 provides only for the loan of textbooks to nonpublic school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.794" offset="20998562">Now the Act recites that the other -- that the public school children in Pennsylvania already have the benefit of free textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.118" offset="21027819">However, I would like to point out that it's the local school board which provides textbooks to public school children in Pennsylvania and not the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.822" offset="21070660">The state has singled out a special class of the beneficiaries for which it is using tax raised state revenues for the support and administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="5273.409" offset="21196988">There is this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.998" offset="21203362">The local school boards must raise the funds to provide the textbooks from local revenues not from state revenues.</text>

            <text syncTime="5366.202" offset="21568136">Now the second thing that I'd like to speak too is the issue which my brother Ball raised concerning burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.166" offset="21604080">He has stated that it is our job to prove that the supplies and materials, and the services mandated by these statutes are being misused for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.561" offset="21661654">However, it is not our burden at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.285" offset="21672521">This Court has held in several instances that the burden is upon the state to make certain, given the religion clauses that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion Lemon v. Kurtzman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.999" offset="21731349">And furthermore the state must see to it that state supported activity is not being used for religious indoctrination Levitt v. Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.729" offset="21786311">So the burden is not upon the complainants, but rather is upon the state or commonwealth to prove that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.094" offset="21823718">Furthermore, there is a record and in the record we introduced guidelines established by the Pennsylvania, Department of Education for the administration of this Acts and we believe this guidelines show beyond any peradventure of a doubt that there's pernicious entanglement with religion by the state administering these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.427" offset="21921102">They just can't be administered without numerous contacts with the nonpublic schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.806" offset="21970631">As an aside from one of our interrogatories, we asked the defendants to state whether any of the person's employed by defendants or the intermediate units provide auxiliary services were previously employed by a nonpublic schools to which they are assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.120" offset="22031862">The answer of the state is that there are some situations where this does exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.933" offset="22055058">In other words what has been done in some situations is simply take auxiliary service personnel from the nonpublic school payroll and put it on the public school payroll.</text>

            <text syncTime="5526.018" offset="22207404">However testing is one of the services provided under Act Number 194, but what testing in campuses I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.098" offset="22263724">We believed the statute is open ended that it could cover almost anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="5551.646" offset="22309909">No only on hearing defects and I think speech defects there is some evidence in the record on those two things, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.099" offset="22363721">One of the claims of the defendants is that the statutes are self-policing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.712" offset="22394232">We believe that that just isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.098" offset="22407816">Obviously the District Court below did not think they were self-policing otherwise it would not have rewritten Act Number 195 with respect to instructional equipment and that's really what the Court did because the Act itself states that instructional equipment is to include projection equipment, recording equipment, laboratory equipment and any other educational secular and neutral non-ideologically equipment as maybe a benefit to the instruction of nonpublic school children and are present here at to provide for public school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.366" offset="22536861">The Court excised projection equipment, recording equipment, etcetera from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.903" offset="22571029">So in effect, it rewrote the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.981" offset="22587329">Also the nonpublic school people apparently don't think the Acts are self-policing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.044" offset="22623587">Dr. Basinhoofer who testified as a school psychologist on behalf of interveners Diaz et al., and Ms. Stopper a speech therapist and Sister Mary Denise Donavan the coordinator of human relations education for the City of Pittsburgh for the catholic schools of Pittsburgh, all said that they had been repeatedly warned by the public school authorities that they had to be very careful that none of these services, none of the supplies or equipment were used for religious purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="5670.536" offset="22785546">Well I think it tell us this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.692" offset="22794115">It tells us that it can't be done without constant surveillance or without constant reminders and I think the state has to do more than just remind them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.086" offset="22839672">I think the state has to see to it that they're not used for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.240" offset="22876348">Since my time is about up, I'm going to summarize this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.418" offset="22893066">Act Number 194 provides services which are part of a modern secondary educational institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.259" offset="22928384">The characterization of auxiliary does not mean that they are auxiliary to the school system and simply auxiliary to the normal instruction program of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.644" offset="22969971">They are part and the witnesses for the interveners testified that these services were essential to modern secondary educational system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.573" offset="23025664">I see that my time is up, so I won't go on with my argument.</text>
