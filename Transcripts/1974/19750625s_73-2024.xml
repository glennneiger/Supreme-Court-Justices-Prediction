            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.078" offset="40229">This case is here on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.804" offset="63216">It involves an attack on the zoning laws and practices of Penfield, New York, a town adjacent to Rochester.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.780" offset="99056">Petitioners alleged the construction of low and moderate cost housing suitable for persons of low and moderate income has been prevented by the zoning practice of Penfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.837" offset="151301">The District Court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.108" offset="172408">We agree with these Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.547" offset="182126">For reasons stated in our opinion filed today, we conclude that none of the petitioners has alleged facts sufficient to satisfy the threshold requirement of standing to sue in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.616" offset="246387">Certain of them, in particular the low-income minority group plaintiffs, have not shown that they personally have been injured by the challenged zoning practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.549" offset="294139">Other petitioners based their claim to relief on the legal rights of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.484" offset="317858">As no statute grants them a right of action, we find no justification for departing from the rule that normally precludes litigants from asserting the legal rights of others as basis of their claim to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.653" offset="386612">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.925" offset="407615">Mr. Justice Douglas has filed a dissenting opinion Mr. Justice Brennan also has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
