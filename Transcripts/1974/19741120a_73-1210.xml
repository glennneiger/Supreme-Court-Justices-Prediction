            <text syncTime="15.074" offset="163715">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.045" offset="175522">This is a direct appeal from a final judgment of a three-judge District Court setting aside a Commission’s car Service Order rendered pursuant to 1(15) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.514" offset="221393">Although the case is couched in technical terms, the issue before this Court is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.540" offset="249501">The issue was whether the lower court erred in finding that the order of the Commission was a rate order fixed without due process considerations or instead was it an order directed at the use to which the boxcars were put.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.158" offset="320031">We submit that Service Order 1134 is a temporary order aimed at the extended use of the scarce boxcar resources as mobile lumber warehouses during a period of unquestioned transportation emergency and as such well within the reach of 1(15).</text>
            <text syncTime="74.982" offset="403310">This Court is well aware given the light of the Allegheny-Ludlum case in Florida East Coast of the chronic boxcar shortage facing the country today.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.977" offset="443329">There's no need to believe on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.450" offset="457122">However, the order that we are considering here today arises out of an emergency over and above the chronic shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.585" offset="501739">In 1972 and early 1973, the country was enjoying a tremendous economic boom, record crops were being harvested and moved to the country elevators and a completely unexpected event happened to create a transportation emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.905" offset="583032">The unprecedented and unexpected Russian grain deal completely strained and place unsustainable strain on the boxcar fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.485" offset="633292">The Commission moved on many fronts to make sure that the cars moved in the public interest during this time of transportation emergency.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="142.269" offset="672475">When was that, in the summer of 1973?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles H. White, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="144.284" offset="680521">No Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.145" offset="683969">This was in the fall harvest of 1972 going into the early spring of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.011" offset="715421">This was the time of the crisis that hit the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.165" offset="736005">The Commission orchestrated a series of car Service Orders to move the cars expeditiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.691" offset="762128">For instance, in Service Order 1120, it limited the number of jumbo covered hopper cars that were available to any unit train shippers so that all grain shippers would have a fair share of the -- of this transportation resource to move the grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.286" offset="836524">In 1121, the Commission was faced with the situation of growing congestion of the ports and it cut back on the free time available to the shippers of grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.783" offset="890546">In 1117, perhaps the most important of the car Service Order in that series; the Commission diverted coal cars, the open top hopper cars from the coal industry to the movement of grain and as pertinent here, the Commission decided in the face of the emergency that unrestrained, unlimited reconsignment by the lumber shippers was exacerbating the transportation emergency and car Service Order number 1134 temporaril limited the reconsignment privileges of the lumber shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.945" offset="1055117">Reconsignment that the issue before the Court today is markedly different from the transit privileges that this Court considered in the Wichita case briefly a transit privilege allows the shipper to stop his movement for the physical activity of something like inspecting the grain or creosoting lumber and to continue on with the movement and still enjoy the benefits of the true rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.096" offset="1171728">Reconsignment on the other hand allows a stopping in movement simply to change the billing or the destination but preserves to the shipper the through rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.944" offset="1283114">And there are various points that have the truckage facilities which the lumber wholesalers used to stop the cars, to let the cars sit out as lumber warehouses while a market develops.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="324.305" offset="1400560">And these are the Midwest somewhere?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles H. White, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="326.862" offset="1410800">Primarily in the Midwest, but in a far west possibly in Wyoming, Washington State but generally the movement is correctly pointed from the northwest towards the east and the reconsignment points might conceivably be in any place in that quadrant of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.507" offset="1481435">And in fact, that leads to an interesting point reconsignment of its very nature must involve some degree of security because a certain percentage of the lumber that's reconsigned is reconsigned backwards or perhaps not in the most expeditious route to the final destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.248" offset="1556355">The lumber wholesalers are the primary users of the reconsignment technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.199" offset="1576208">A lumber is sold -- a lumber is marketed in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.665" offset="1594075">Primarily, there are large mills, lumber mills that have their own storage capacity and their own sales force.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.449" offset="1625213">There are also small mills which collectively provide the bulk of the lumber that comes eastward.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.623" offset="1649873">The small mills typically have no storage facilities nor that they have a sales force.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.871" offset="1674846">They looked to the lumber wholesalers off to market the lumber and to provide the -- where withhold for storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.537" offset="1701491">But the lumber wholesalers themselves have no storage capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.349" offset="1724792">They simply purchase the lumber and immediately cost it to be loaded on to the boxcars and set the boxcars in motion eastward and the boxcars are held that the reconsignment point until a market is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.298" offset="1784560">The boxcars, while they're at a reconsignment point, are subject only to the external stimulus of demurrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.148" offset="1816012">Under the tariffs they're pertaining, there is no limit to the time that the boxcars can sit idle.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.100" offset="1843806">Demurrage is the only incentive to get the cars moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.794" offset="1858539">But in a case of a rising market, a case of an inflationary time, the demurrage incentive has typically been found not to excite fast release of the scarce boxcars.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.423" offset="1997093">Well, Your Honor if the demurrage was increased sufficiently as you put it, the exact -- the limitation of the storage time would still be uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.564" offset="2057592">Demurrage as you know has a gradual increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.966" offset="2075251">The overriding need that the Commission felt was to get the cars back into motion quickly and within a time period that was reasonably determined to be five working days.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.485" offset="2129272">An increase in the demurrage rate would provide an incentive, you're correct in asking that question getting the cars back but it's not certain when it would become economically feasible, economically sufficient in magnitude to get the cars rolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.606" offset="2197817">The Commission in this case felt a need to get the cars back in at least five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.271" offset="2224462">And as the Commission stated in its Service Order itself, demurrage hadn't been working in this particular segment of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.527" offset="2261452">It hadn't been providing a significant incentive to get the cars back on motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.111" offset="2331773">Yes Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.267" offset="2344417">During the emergency period, the Commission looked very carefully at the statistics of just what distortions in the transportation system were being provided by the reconsignment technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.498" offset="2401364">And I have found that by early 1973, the supply of the 40-foot wide door boxcars was averaging in a daily basis over 600.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.447" offset="2441174">The 50-foot cars were over 2,200 scarce.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.639" offset="2461968">And of all boxcars, we were experiencing a scarcity of something in the order of 13,000 cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.113" offset="2487777">Meanwhile, the Commission's studies show that the average whole time of reconsignment point was 10 days and holding experiences of 20 to 30 days were not uncommon.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.971" offset="2539290">In this light, a Commission determined that the emergency was being exacerbated by the reconsignment technique and issued car Service Order number 1134.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.523" offset="2589445">In the face of the Order itself, the Commission's rationale was completely outlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.994" offset="2611388">The Commission found that the shortage of boxcars was impeding the movement of many commodities that the cars were being held for excessive periods of reconsignment points, that the practice was immobilizing cars needed by shippers of other commodities and perhaps most important that demurrage technique was not a sufficient incentive to get the cars moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.260" offset="2688397">So, the Commission suspended as it can under 1(15) (a) the car service rule which is embodied in open-ended reconsignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.153" offset="2731969">It limited reconsignment to five days, it did not eliminate reconsignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.062" offset="2755584">The Commission went one step further and explained in gratuitous language what the legal effect was of suspending the car service rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.900" offset="2791006">It explained the purpose of the car Service Order, it explained the result that after the fifth day, after the reconsignment privilege has terminated the shipper must bear as he would anyways some of the local rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.126" offset="2855894">Those words are not words of rate prescription, they are a merely description of what the legal affect of the order is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.243" offset="8784332">Now, this Court can affirm the judgment of the courts below on one of two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.231" offset="8828322">The first is to follow the reasoning of the District Court and hold that Service Order number 1134 did not constitute a car Service Order as authorized by 49 U.S.C. 1(15) and was invalid because as the Court stated, it was in illegal rate fixing order developed through procedures lacking due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.179" offset="8936051">Now, let me say parenthetically, nobody before this Court argues that the Interstate Commerce Commission does not have the power assuming that it uses due process to do what it desires assuming that it gives due hearing with respect to reconversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.146" offset="9023927">I think my brother admitted that if it uses Section 1549 U.S.C. 1(15), it can issue a new tariff or compel a new tariff but in that case of course we would have to have a hearing and the industry input would have to be there and you would not have bungled without us knowing anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.789" offset="9114520">The industry would have an opportunity to have something to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.711" offset="9130193">At this point, there is no opportunity whatsoever the order was issued before we even know about it and sometime it become effective before the industry knows anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.707" offset="9178154">So, there is no question about the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission assuming that it provides ordinary due process which Section 1(15) does not provide and this is what this case is all about as I indicated in my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.689" offset="9398105">So, that when you're talking in terms of possibly a year as against 50 years or 75 years, it seems to me that if this Court which balances the interest and this is the balance wheel of the nation really that even assuming it takes a year they give due process which it might very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.691" offset="9486085">The element of due process which the Court well knows is so important is worth it particularly when we know that for years and years and years unless something is done we're going to have some emergency or another, if it's not the Russian grain deal, it will be the Patagonian wheat deal or it will be some other deal that will come in and because the basic fact is there just not enough cars and when you don't have enough cars the slightest dislocation causes a “emergency on the basis of the Interstate Commerce Commission”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.629" offset="9929853">The court below went on perfectly sound and legal grounds namely that it was a rate order and Section 1(15) did not provide for changes in rates but there is underlying this whole case and something I'd like to get across to the Court a more fundamental question, a question which is this Court peculiarly is designed to take care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.216" offset="10040195">And that question is this, “Must this Court or any court accept the ipse dixit of the Interstate Commerce Commission inspite of all the evidence to the contrary that the freight car situation on the nation's railroad is a temporary emergency which should be dealt with under the provisions of 491 U.S.C. 15 rather than a long continuing and probably permanent problem” and as the Court well knows this is what we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.670" offset="10194004">Section 49 U.S.C. 114 which is the general rule making power and provides full due process procedures and Section 49 U.S.C. 15 which is the true and joint rate provision of the Interstate Commerce Act provides an ordinary means of dealing with the problem giving all interest to parties full due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.129" offset="10299852">The broader issue before this Court and it can only be made before this Court is whether this Court will sanction the abrogation of the doctrine of judicial supremacy which I have been taught and have taught others to believe is one of the principle doctrines of American constitutional law.</text>
