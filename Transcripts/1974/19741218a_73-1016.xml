            <label>Mr. Alan W. Rubenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="17.063" offset="171656">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.503" offset="173432">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.575" offset="185657">These are consolidated appeals which present fundamental issues basic to the Aid For Dependent Children's Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.717" offset="226200">Broadly stated, the issue is kind of parent or caretaker relative refused to cooperate and state efforts to obtain support for a child from its father where that child is receiving AFDC benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.380" offset="300910">And the further question is, can that parent still claim benefits as a parent or relative upon her refusal to so cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.998" offset="347408">The decisions of the lower courts starting with Doe against Shapiro of Connecticut Federal District Court case in 1969 have consistency held that where a mother and child had been denied assistance by states or the mother's failure to cooperate, assistance may not be terminated to the mother and child.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.894" offset="454928">This Court in three summary affirmances affirmed to the principle enunciated in Doe against Shapiro, that early case.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.913" offset="495052">These are Doe against Swank, Meyers against Juras, and Taylor against Martin.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.468" offset="521279">Of course the summary affirmances didn't deal explicitly with anything, they were just that and I didn't mean to convey anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.445" offset="561194">State attempts to discontinue grants of the mother only were invalidated by federal courts in Connecticut in Doe against Harder, the successor to Doe against Shapiro in which the State of Connecticut had amended its regulation to cutoff benefits to the mother only.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.660" offset="637994">Commissioner Hardy was held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.412" offset="649070">He appealed to this Court but pending appeal he was purged of contempt by changing the regulation and this Court had dismissed that appeal for one of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.647" offset="701942">It had dismissed that the appeal in Doe against Shapiro, the earlier case for late docketing with two justices dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.771" offset="738408">Also, other courts in Pennsylvania, Iowa, and New York have followed the lead of the Harder Court and held that assistance may not be denied to the mother for her failure to cooperate in stayed efforts to establish paternity or to secure a support for her child.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.177" offset="816044">The result of these decisions halting state efforts to terminate the grant of the mother for her failure to cooperate has been that the state has been unable to comply with the provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.202" offset="872155">That the intent of Congress to require such parental cooperation has been frustrated that the AFDC system has been turned upside down, putting the mother in the driver seat rather than the state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.337" offset="932760">The people who should contribute to AFDC support thereby reducing need are not contributing.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.222" offset="964211">And that the ancient duty of parents to support their children has been shifted to the states and to the local Social Services Districts contrary to the provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.177" offset="1016038">Now, New York's interest in this litigation and that of its Social Services District is legitimate and substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.473" offset="1045295">The place of residence of AFDC fathers in New York State is unknown to the caseworker.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.721" offset="1066297">It is believed in something over 50% of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.551" offset="1081553">It is anticipated that the state locals and the local shares combined for fiscal year 1974 under the matching formula, for AFDC, will amount to something more than $700 million in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.779" offset="1146441">And we submit that the state should have every opportunity to reduce what is becoming a staggering cause and has been has been staggering cause for a number of years by pursuing every avenue open to them to require these fathers to contribute to the support of their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.889" offset="1218957">Now, as originally instituted, this case involved claims of the mothers that the county agency had required them to cooperate in instituting and prosecuting non-support proceedings under a state departmental regulation requiring that they furnish pertinent information in the location and prosecution of a deserting or abandoning parent, that the non-cooperative parent was ineligible for public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.779" offset="1322506">But that the grants for her children were continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.424" offset="1333060">It was only the mother who was discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.725" offset="1346226">While an appeal was pending to this Court from the order of the -- on the original hearing which declared the state regulation violative of the Social Security Act to the extent that it requires parents or relatives to institute and prosecute nonsupport actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.293" offset="1408502">New York Social Services Law, Section 101-a was amended to insert therein a new Subdivision 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.437" offset="1437132">Now, these require that a recipient of public assistance, it's not limited in its application, only to Aid to Families with Dependent Children.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.460" offset="1469210">It's a statute of general application, but obviously in this case, we're talking about Aid to Families with Dependent Children.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.866" offset="1498885">The statute requires that a recipient of public assistance cooperate with a Social Services official in obtaining support or support contributions from the other parent by furnishing of the Social Services official with appropriate information including the location of the other parent or spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.965" offset="1583208">By filing a petition and furnishing evidence in a proceeding for paternity and support or for nonsupport.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.662" offset="1618004">But if the applicant fails to file the petition, nothing happens except that the Social Services official is required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.624" offset="1657919">Then, if the applicant fails to furnish evidence necessary to support a petition for paternity and support or for nonsupport in a marital situation or if the person fails to furnish information relative to the location of the other parent, her maintenance can be discontinued for her willful failure to do so, so long as she fails to assist and cooperate as required by the statute and only so long as she fails to assist and cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.763" offset="1790412">The children's grant continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.224" offset="1804309">Now, because of the amendment to Social Services Law, Section 101-a, this Court remanded for further consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.279" offset="1836492">And after remand, the original plaintiff's below moved to reconvene the three-judge court to amend the complaint and for intervention by an unwed mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.973" offset="1883303">There had been no unwed mothers in the case before that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.853" offset="1898768">The three-judge court permitted intervention and amendment of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.946" offset="1919143">The amended complaint however, dealt only with the claim of the intervener, unwed mother who had refused to tell a Social Services official where the known father of one of her children was within a geographical area.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.288" offset="1972537">They knew who he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.244" offset="1976299">She had told them that but she just said, “I won't tell you where he is in this town in Western New York.”</text>
            <text syncTime="475.970" offset="2007228">And the amended complaint, I have to talk about this just for a moment, did not state a claim for the original plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.914" offset="2035022">And since the court had remanded, we were not frankly sure whether this Court would still consider the original plaintiffs to be viable appellees on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.832" offset="2094686">In any event, it appears that the intervener is an automatic appellee here and counsel is quite correctly included her in the title of his papers as an intervener appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.668" offset="2150066">But we did not amend the title of the action because the court below didn't and we -- this is a matter which we must leave entirely to the court of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.893" offset="2194996">The three-judge court after the remand in its memorandum decision and order declared Section 101-a as amended of the New York Social Services Law void, unenforceable and without effect insofar as it makes recipient cooperation in a paternity or support action against an absent parent, a condition of eligibility in AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.786" offset="2286529">And the court below enjoined the defendants in that case, the state and county officers from terminating assistance to the intervener or her minor children for failure to cooperate in obtaining support.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.560" offset="2337625">The order on its second argument did not act upon the original plaintiffs at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.327" offset="2364688">Now, if the original plaintiffs for whom those claim was stated in the amended complaint which was actually an intervener's complaint we plead, deemed by the court to still be in the case, the question presented is whether an AFDC, a parent or caretaker must assist or cooperate in a nonsupport proceeding instituted by a Social Services official.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.801" offset="2454549">As to the intervener, the question presented is whether she may be required to furnish the location of the father of one of her children to the Social Services official.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.170" offset="2496031">And as I say, prior to the intervention of this unwed mother, we had no paternity aspect to this case whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.023" offset="2531453">But as it stands before the Court now, it has both nonsupport and paternity support aspects depending upon the Court's construction of its own remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.970" offset="2575235">Now, we contend that the New York statue furthers the provisions of the Social Security Act, simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.792" offset="2606582">The appellees contend that the statute creates a condition of eligibility not provided for in the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.870" offset="2638869">And so that, we answer we don't think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.553" offset="2649631">But even if it does, the Social Security Act not only allows for state efforts to abstain support and establish paternity but require such action.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.544" offset="2689546">And that the statute is within the legitimate sphere of state administration and is necessary to the proper administration of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.898" offset="2730924">The state statute does not violate any specific provision of the Social Security Act or rather as friendly too and furthers the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.388" offset="2768959">This Court discussed the statutes, the provisions in the Social Security Act that are involved on this appeal and its decision in King against Smith when it was in connection of course with the Alabama Man-in-the-House-Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.266" offset="2840430">The court set out these statutes, federal statutes to which I'll allude in a moment, and said, the pattern -- this is a 392 U.S. 332, the pattern of this legislation could not be clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.958" offset="2899153">Every effort is to be made to locate and secure support payments from persons legally obligated to support a deserted child.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.713" offset="2934262">And later on in the same page, the provision seeks to secure parental support in lieu of AFDC support for dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.024" offset="2975431">That is exactly what New York is trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.982" offset="2999254">New York Social Services Law, Section 101-a, 2 and 3 implements the provisions of the Section 402 (a), 17 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.201" offset="3044185">It implements the provisions of such in 402 (a) (7) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.294" offset="3076577">Section 402 (a) (17) requires -- I'm reading from page 46 of my appellant brief, the appendix, that a state plan must provide for the development and implementation of a program under which the state agency will undertake one, in the case of a child born out of wedlock who is receiving aid to families with dependent children to establish the paternity of such child and secures support from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.689" offset="3186082">And two, in the case of any child receiving such aid who has been deserted or abandoned by his parent to secure support for such a child, from such a parent or from any other person legally liable for such support utilizing any (Inaudible) code.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.374" offset="3248880">Agreements adopted with other states to obtain and/or enforce court orders for support.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.312" offset="3268629">And Section 7, 402 (a) (7) provides that the state in determining need shall take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming Aid to Families with Dependent Children.</text>
