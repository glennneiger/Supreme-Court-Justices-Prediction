            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="17.444" offset="152774">The question in these cases which come to us from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is whether there is a right to counsel in summary court-martial proceedings in the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.895" offset="202615">We conclude that neither the Sixth Amendment nor Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment required counsel in such proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.399" offset="232604">In this case most of the plaintiffs were charged with unauthorized absences and were tried with their consent and convected by Navy summary courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.659" offset="273668">They brought this class action in District Court challenging the authority of the armed services to try them at summary courts-martial without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.400" offset="308672">The District Court ruled in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.919" offset="318703">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Courtâ€™s judgment and remanded for reconsideration in the light of its decision in an earlier case in which it had held that though there was no Sixth Amendment right to counsel in summary court-martial proceedings, there was, in certain cases, a right under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.585" offset="401355">We agree that there is no Sixth Amendment right to counsel, because summary courts-martial proceeding is not a criminal prosecution, as that term is used in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.950" offset="442837">It is a facet of military discipline with limited penalties for charges which frequently have no common law counterpart.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.697" offset="473766">Furthermore, unlike a civilian trail, it is not like an adversary proceeding where counsel is required to counter an opposing advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.431" offset="504800">We also hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment imposes no requirement of counsel in such proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.711" offset="533848">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on the appeal of the plaintiffs is affirmed and the appeal of the federal parties is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.806" offset="582227">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Blackmun joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.590" offset="605423">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.078" offset="619321">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.317" offset="640323">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or the decision of these cases.</text>
