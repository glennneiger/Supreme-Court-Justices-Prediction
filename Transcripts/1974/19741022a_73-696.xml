            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments next in 73-696, Emporium Capwell Company against Western Addition Community and the Labor Board's related petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.705" offset="326196">Mr. Wallace.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="58.909" stopTime="435.996">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="58.909" offset="339048">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.769" offset="354408">With a possible limitation to which I shall refer in a moment, the question decided by the National Labor Relations Board in the Court of Appeals in this case and presented in the petitions for certiorari granted by this Court, is whether under the National Labor Relations Act, interpreted in light of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to discharge dissident employees for engaging in concerted activities designed to force the employer to bargain collectively, directly with them, instead of with the exclusive bargaining representative, over alleged racially discriminatory employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.805" offset="610617">The company here, the petitioner in the number 73-696, is a retail department store which is a party to a collective agreement and that agreement contains an anti-discrimination provision set forth on page 101 of the printed appendix under Section 21 of the Collective Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.507" offset="749380">You'll note that the anti-discrimination provision of the contract prohibits discrimination by reason of race, color, creed, national origin, age or sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.020" offset="807476">There's a potential there for many and probably most employees in a bargaining unit therefore to belong to one or another minority group in those categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.896" offset="871006">In a series of meetings held in 1968, a group of employees covered by the agreement, including Messrs Hawkins and Hollins, the two whose discharge is the subject of the decision here, met with their Union representative to discuss various dissatisfactions they had with the company, including their belief that there was racial discrimination in the company's employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.901" offset="1030980">At the third meeting, the Union representative expressed his view that there indeed was racial discrimination and that the Union was prepared to invoke the grievance procedures under the collective agreement to remedy discrimination, in accordance with those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.288" offset="1124498">At that third meeting, some of those in attendance said that they would prefer if the Union would picket the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.524" offset="1165458">They expressed dissatisfaction with the remedy that the Union was proposing to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.891" offset="1202970">The Union representative, the Chief Executive Officer of the Union rejected this request on the ground that it would be contrary to the Union's obligations under the collective agreement to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.007" offset="1255424">And that in his view, an orderly processing of grievances would have a broader and more long lasting effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.884" offset="1294921">And on the following day on behalf of the Union, he formally requested a hearing before the Adjustment Board which is the first step in processing the grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.719" offset="1350196">And the hearing was convened in October of that year and it started off with presentation of evidence by the Union representative by questioning employees regarding their individual grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.460" offset="1429191">This was interrupted by employee Hollins, one of the two who was discharged, who acting as spokesman for Hawkins, the other one before the Court and two others, read a prepared statement objecting to the prosecution of grievances on an individual rather than a group basis and stating that this group of four would not speak as individuals but would speak only as a group and he added that they wanted to talk with the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.977" offset="1595329">As he put it their main purpose was to talk to the president to try to reach an agreement with him to straighten out the problems and conditions of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.929" offset="1651127">Then after refusing to give testimony, the four walked out of the Adjustment Board meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.470" offset="1685295">The grievance procedures nonetheless were carried forward and resulted in promotions being secured for two individuals as to whom grievances had been pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.696" offset="1766170">And this part of the record is the basis for the finding of the National Labor Relations Board on Page 103 of the Appendix to the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.691" offset="1934085">All the evidence indicates that the Union, their dully designated bargaining representative was endeavoring in every way available to it under the agreement to adjust any and all cases of racial discrimination brought to its attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.046" offset="1999600">And there at least one and apparently two cases have brought about the desired adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.261" offset="2024364">And to this, the board added in a footnote on Page 55 of the same Appendix, in Footnote 2 of the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.700" offset="2090193">And the Board added that the record before us neither requires nor allows the finding that the Union breached its duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.511" offset="2137422">So what the Board might have done in a case in which it had been determined, either previously or in the Board proceedings that the Union had breached its duty of fair representation is a question that the Board really did not reach in this case and is the additional limitation on the question presented that I mentioned at the outset of my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.497" offset="2909393">Well, at least explicitly, let me put it that way, and this is in again the appendix to the petition for certiorari on Page 24 in Footnote 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.274" offset="2992462">Page 24, Footnote 34, the second sentence, the petitioners dispute the Trial Examiner's findings that Hawkins and Hollins activities were “no mere presentation of a grievance, but nothing short of a demand that the Company bargain with the picketing employees for the entire group of minority employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="749.320" offset="3100609">However, we can see no reason to disturb this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.676" offset="3118059">And the dissenting judge was even more emphatic on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.751" offset="3154422">Judge Wyzanski on page 43 of the same appendix as he put it in the fourth line there, there could not be a plainer instance of an attempt to bargain respecting working conditions as distinguished from an adjustment of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.799" offset="3274585">There are -- of course, at first, we contend that there is no reason before the Court to undertake to look behind these findings supported by all three Court of Appeals Judges, but there is -- what support there is, the record is rather thin on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.486" offset="3373328">It all seems to us to look in this direction, part of it where the statements made before the Adjustment Board indicating that their objective was to bargain with the president about conditions at the Emporium.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.866" offset="3446888">And during the hearing, turning to the other appendix now, on Page 11, Mr. Hawkins, in the middle of the page in response to the question, “What were you seeking” said, “to try to talk to the top management to get better conditions for the Emporium.”</text>
            <text syncTime="862.008" offset="3551378">How you are going to do this, through group talk and through the president if we could talk to him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="867.755" offset="3574366">And then when Hollins was testifying, on Pages 60 and 61, he tried on Page 60 to explain why at the Adjustment Board proceedings, they objected to taking up individual grievances rather than the case as a whole and after he explained it in several different ways, interrogating counsel says to him, just to carry it one step further, “It was my understanding that what you were trying to do and you didn't want a solution of the problems of individuals, you wanted some basic change that would benefit the treatment of all minority people, is that right” and the answer is, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.465" offset="3761194">And then on Page 67 as he testifies further at the very bottom of the page, he reiterates that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.104" offset="3795780">I said that we didn't want to have our case taken as an individual thing, as I stated before.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.076" offset="3815633">We all wanted to take it as a whole for the entire betterment of the minority groups of black, brown, red and yellow people there at the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.790" offset="3858578">And while the exact objectives and demands, they are not stated anywhere with a model of clarity, there is one indication in one of the exhibits to the record that begins on Page 115 in the same appendix of the sort of thing that they apparently had in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.262" offset="7264423">Well, it's certainly a possible reading of 9 (a) because it's quite possible that the Union is trying to adjust grievances in one way and that some dissident employees want them adjusted in another way and we'll start engaging in coercive tactics on the employer that are contrary to what the Union is seeking to accomplish in the grievance proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.080" offset="7367659">And that could be very damaging to the employer, such as urging shoppers on a Saturday not to patronize the employer's store and 9 (a) doesn't necessarily mean that Congress meant to sanction that activity and to protect those employees from being discharged, if they insist on doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.540" offset="7449579">It does mean that they have a right to talk with the employer about it if the employer is willing to make the adjustments with them, and that that is a proviso to the exclusive authority of the Union otherwise has.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.273" offset="8020511">I'm not going to repeat or elaborate upon the argument of counsel for the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.268" offset="8044440">I would like in the limited time available to me to point out some of the difficulties and some of the unanswerable questions that have been raised by the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.453" offset="8101177">When parties undertake to bargain collectively, they must first understand clearly what employees are under discussion, and secondly, who in fact represents those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.718" offset="8178291">This requires the answer to three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.318" offset="8196681">Number one, what is the appropriate unit?</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.657" offset="8214026">Number two, who are the eligible voters?</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.037" offset="8231476">And number three, what representative do they choose?</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.022" offset="8279437">Now merely because this case involves bargaining with respect to racial or minority problems does not eliminate those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.672" offset="8326040">In fact, it makes them even more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.969" offset="8351222">We know that Hawkins and Hollins in this case purported to represent all minorities, yellow, red, black and brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.434" offset="8393122">They made no mention of persons discriminated against on the grounds of sex or religion as specified in Title VII and that raises a question as to what is the appropriate unit for purposes of bargaining in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.510" offset="8477445">Should it be the entire group of minority employees or should the employer be required to bargain by each color?</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.307" offset="8532616">Further, should the colors be divided into nationalities?</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.698" offset="8558216">Section 9 (b) of the Labor Management Relations Act declares that the Board shall decide in each case whether in order to assure employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by the Act, the unit shall be the employer, the craft unit, the plant unit or subdivision thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.167" offset="8676080">There is no mention of race or color or minority, and that's a pretty good argument that Congress did not intend that there should be collective bargaining along racial or minority alliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.796" offset="8742536">The point is that the Congress declared that the Board shall decide this question in each case and it shall decide it so as to provide the employees with the maximum freedom of exercising their rights guaranteed to them under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.157" offset="8819963">There is no way in which a decision could be obtained in this case, because any petition to the Board would be rejected on the ground that the employer had already recognized a representative and had a contract with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.953" offset="8891225">It is not up to the employer to decide what shall be the appropriate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.262" offset="8916407">The next question is, who are the eligible voters?</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.594" offset="8937723">Whether we take the unit by color, by race, there must be a decision as to what persons belong in each group, and in these days of interracial marriages and mixed parentage, there are extremely difficult and complex problems in determining what race or color a person belongs to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.639" offset="9033958">There is no machinery provided for a determination of the question of the eligibility list of voters that the employer can safely rely upon in order to undertake bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.371" offset="9100831">Finally, there is no method provided for taking a vote of the employees to decide on what representative they wish to have represent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.690" offset="9158092">It would be folly for the employer in this case to assume that Hawkins and Hollins represented the entire minority group or even the blacks employed in the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.918" offset="9219009">The Trial Examiner pointed out that when the Adjustment Board hearing took place, there were four men who walked out of the Adjustment Board hearing and joined the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.047" offset="9279509">After the employer issued its warning against the picketing and leafleting, two of the employees desisted and there were only Hawkins and Hollins left, not a very impressive presentation to convince the employer that they represented any substantial number of minority employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.310" offset="9400613">The record also shows that in the meeting that the Union held, with the minority employees, representatives of the EEOC and the state FEPC urged the minority employees to go along with the Union and that it was in their best interest, and we believe the employer was entitled to express sufficient doubts about bargaining with Hawkins and Hollins to refuse to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.338" offset="9532688">Assuming that we waive all the difficulties raised by those procedural questions, we have that problem of what the employer is supposed to do in order to try that comply with the opinion of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.586" offset="9605726">And if the Court pleased, this is the first case to my knowledge where any employer has been directed to recognize two collective bargaining representatives representing the same employees at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.532" offset="9673540">That's not easy to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.102" offset="9691826">The Court suggested that -- I'd like to read from the language of the Court “we cannot agree that any inconvenience --</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.475" offset="9849292">Now aside form the problem of dealing with two bargaining representatives at the same time, the notion of carrying out the grievance procedures is a futility because of the fact that the principal witnesses walked out and refused to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.357" offset="9948766">When it comes to bargaining with the representatives of the minority, I would refer the Court to what it said in its opinion in Alexander against Gardner-Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.707" offset="10018252">In that case, the Court held that an arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement did not bar an action in court to correct racial discrimination, but when it came to the subject of bargaining on the subject of discrimination, this is what the Court said, “Title VII strictures are absolute and represent a congressional command that each employee be free from discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.475" offset="10169240">Of necessity, the rights conferred can form no part of the collective-bargaining process since waiver of these rights would defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind Title VII.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.690" offset="10226082">That is a statement by the unanimous court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.098" offset="10243741">Now Hawkins and Hollins were picketing the employer, to compel the employer to bargain with them concerning racial discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.716" offset="10786252">Before starting on my own presentation, I would like to respond briefly to some of the points that preceding counsel had made and some of the questions which have been asked by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.818" offset="10822614">Let me take them in reverse order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.420" offset="10833063">I think it's clear that the Jefferson Standard question is not here before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.305" offset="10860544">That was the issue upon which the Court of Appeals remanded to the Board to determine whether there had been such a display of disloyalty that the employees ought not to be rehired, but the Court recognized that the Trial Examiner who wrote the decision which the Board adopted, while he had made extensive findings of fact, had declined to rule on the issue and on that basis, the Court of Appeals refused to rule on it either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.480" offset="10973288">I think it's not been raised in the petitions for certiorari, and it is not before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.408" offset="11005053">I trust from my briefs that it's clear that we are not here advocating collective bargaining according to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.636" offset="11041938">It's quite the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.090" offset="11047685">It's the purpose of our position to encourage unions and management to be more responsive to the problems of minorities and to solve those problems within the framework of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.960" offset="11103169">Courts have said, we think it's correct, that there cannot be strong concerted Union activity so long as the employees are divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.835" offset="11138696">That would be the case if the Union had no responsibility, if the employer had no responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.415" offset="11161057">We think what we are urging upon the Court is a method by which minorities can be accommodated by which statutes can be accommodated so that industrial peace will continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.770" offset="11346422">It proved to be a futile attempt and at that point reluctantly Hollins and Hawkins with the advice of the Union that what they intended to do was not unlawful, did not violate the terms of the contract abandoned the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.426" offset="11409115">If the women had the strong statistical support for their claims that we knew it was a good faith claim, then I think the answer is yes, we would make exactly the same position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.412" offset="11977017">In this case, we've alleged that what the employees have done was to seek parity, that is to say they have sought what the contract as well as statute requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.634" offset="12133857">We believe it is appropriate for this Court to look at the facts and to draw the proper legal conclusion based on those facts, and the facts are simply not in dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.044" offset="13791587">I wanted to mention just a few facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.308" offset="13808619">In November 1968, Tom Hollins and Jim Hawkins, two Black stock clerks at the Emporium were fired because as their warning notices and as their termination slip said, they twice had distributed leaflets to the public protesting their employer's racially discriminatory employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.072" offset="13891688">This is the only reason for discharge mentioned either in the preliminary warnings or in the discharge slips themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.528" offset="13925439">No one disputes that the employees concerted activity was an effort to vindicate their statutory and contractual rights to nondiscrimination, rights as this Court has said of the highest priority; now that their conduct was peaceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.413" offset="13981027">There was no violence, no obstruction, they were on a public sidewalk, there was no harassment of customers, no disparagement of goods and services, no appeal to the employees, no work stoppage, no strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.427" offset="14033063">They leafleted twice on Saturdays on their own time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.665" offset="14054066">No one disputes that the concerted activities were based on a good faith belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.928" offset="14071097">In fact, it was the Union's official position that discrimination was being practiced at the Emporium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.427" offset="14101086">No one disputes that for seven months, Hollins and Hawkins tried to work through the Union, that they undertook their own efforts only when it became clear that they could not succeed in a realistic remedy for racial discrimination by following the Union's processes and the Union advised them that they were free as individuals to do what they intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.197" offset="14188126">The question before the Court then we would say is whether this lawful concerted activity somehow is deprived of the protection of the National Labor Relations Act because it may have threatened or harmed Union management relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.173" offset="14252074">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the activities were protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.071" offset="14271613">The discharges were prohibited, that the activities which the Court characterized as attempts to bargain, constituted such limited interference with Section 9 (a) exclusivity principles that because of the employees' purpose in vindicating their important rights, employees remained entitled to the protection of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4175.691" offset="16806118">No, it was nondiscrimination in employment of those who were present at the Emporium.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.880" offset="16830882">Most of the record testimony which has to do with what the employees did, how they ascertained as a good faith belief that there was discrimination really goes to the placement of individuals throughout the store and to their promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.985" offset="16887306">I think it's silent as to hiring, although there is statistical information in the record that the hiring was not so good either.</text>

            <text syncTime="4212.017" offset="16951463">I'll ask a minor one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.939" offset="16963166">I'm frank to say I'm disturbed by the standard that the majority of the Court of Appeals established when it speaks of the first resort to the Union and then failure to remedy the discrimination and I quote now “to the fullest extent possible by the most expedient and efficacious means.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.147" offset="17055953">What is that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.323" offset="17068701">How can it be implemented?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth Hecht</label>
            <text syncTime="4243.416" offset="17077060">That maybe frank to say that at first I was troubled by that standard too, and I'd like to offer following observations on it if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.658" offset="17118020">I think the standard attempts to go a little bit farther than the Court has gone in its duty of fair representation of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.371" offset="17152815">Duty of fair representation as we've indicated in our brief always requires a showing of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.488" offset="17185311">The Union here was not malicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.296" offset="17192521">They simply weren't effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.142" offset="17199940">I think as the court below is suggesting that that kind of inactivity, or ineffectiveness or disinterest maybe enough to permit employees to try to go out without the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.099" offset="17255737">The Board administers phrases and standards of that amorphousness all the time, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.510" offset="17293458">They administer standards such as duty to bargain, duty to bargain in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.312" offset="17320626">These are very difficult duty of fair representation, these are very difficult as words alone to administer, but that's what the administrative agency does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.409" offset="17365034">As this Court has said in a case involving jurisdictional disputes, soon after that section of the statute became implemented, the difficulty of administering a standard is not a reason for the Board, not to accept the jurisdiction to administer the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.528" offset="17433475">It maybe difficult, but doesn't give them an excuse to avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.520" offset="17449462">Finally and may I point out that recently in a case that we cited several times in our brief, the case of the Labor Boards called Bekins, Bekins Moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.726" offset="17490317">The Board showed that it was willing to get into the very difficult area of race discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.634" offset="17529919">When the question came up, should a Union be certified after it had won an election, but the employer alleged that the Union was practicing discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.455" offset="17577148">That's not easy either, and the Board said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.757" offset="17586448">They said it's a difficult test that we have set for ourselves, but we're going to take it on a case-by-case basis and we're going to do it because we think the Constitution requires that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.303" offset="17628557">I don't think that the test which the Court of Appeals is suggested here is anymore difficult than those which the Board has voluntarily and over a period of time administered.</text>

            <text syncTime="4400.702" offset="17706193">Well, with respect to the standard, I'll just say that the word remedying and what constitutes the proper remedy for agreed upon discrimination is itself subject to great dispute, let alone by the most efficacious and effective means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.482" offset="17789262">And we regard this as not only putting the Board into a very difficult role of trying to second guess the discretion exercised by the bargaining representative, but also putting the bargaining representative into a role of deciding rather than what it thinks is the best way to proceed, deciding what it thinks the Board will think is the way that it should proceed to remedy something which is very troublesome in the Standard adopted, thank you.</text>
