            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">In ITT versus Local 134.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.718" offset="22779">It was a Labor Relations case coming out of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.033" offset="40124">ITT charged that the union had engaged in a jurisdictional strike prohibited by Section 8 (b) (4) (D) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.886" offset="79517">By striking an order to force and employer to assign its particular work rather than give the work to another union.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.076" offset="108251">Pursuant to Section 10 (k) of the Act, the Board determined that another union was entitled to the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.571" offset="134269">And only after respondent refused to comply that determination did the Board charge respondent with an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.191" offset="168751">At the unfair labor practice proceeding, the Board found that the union had committed an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.582" offset="198322">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit however declined to enforce the Board's order on the grounds that participation by a Board attorney in both the 10 (k) and the 8 (b) (4) (D) proceedings violated Section 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.935" offset="275644">We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the Circuits on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.796" offset="299154">The APA section at issue applies only in cases of adjudication as that term is defined by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.649" offset="334576">The Board's Section 10 (k) proceeding however is not such an adjudication since it is neither itself a final disposition of any issue nor is it agency process for the formulation of an order as that term is defined in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.802" offset="403122">Standing alone, the Section 10 (k) determination is not binding on the union nor does it order a union to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.024" offset="436036">The focus in the later unfair labor practice proceeding is materially different in the proceedings are separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.874" offset="463412">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
