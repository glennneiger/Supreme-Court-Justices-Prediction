            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="49.411" offset="301014">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.568" offset="305612">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.072" offset="315643">This case comes here again on a second direct appeal from a three-judge District Court in the southern district of Mississippi to consider certain issues which were not reached by the Court in its first -- in its consideration of the first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.068" offset="379695">The broad question presented is whether a regulation of the Mississippi State Tax Commission imposes an unconstitutional state tax upon instrumentalities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.178" offset="436120">The regulation in question requires out of State liquor distillers to collect tax from military purchasing facilities and to remit this tax to the State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.578" offset="489723">It is the position of the United States that the District Court was wrong in upholding the validity of the tax as applied to these sales to the military purchases in the four bases within the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.322" offset="548655">The facts as before are largely undisputed and stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.171" offset="576031">Prior to 1966, Mississippi completely prohibited the sale or possession of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.493" offset="609364">In 1966, it adopted a local option beverage control law.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.391" offset="636949">Those statutes are set forth in the appendix to our brief, at pages 47 and 48.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.680" offset="670072">The new law provided that the State Tax Commission was to be the sole importer and wholesaler of alcoholic beverages within Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.264" offset="712391">Under the statute, the State Tax Commission is authorized to sell liquor to retailers in the state, including any retailers on military posts within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.457" offset="757217">A related statute provides that the Commission shall add such markups within its discretion to cover cost and provide profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.118" offset="795878">So, the statutory scheme essentially established a monopoly by the State of Mississippi in the wholesaling of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.049" offset="827538">But the State Tax Commission promulgated so called Regulation 25, which is really at the heart, the validity of which is at the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.745" offset="866304">That regulation permits the military to purchase liquor from the Commission as could anyone in Mississippi, or directly from the distillers.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.347" offset="920743">However, the regulation goes on to provide that if the military chooses to exercise its option to purchase liquor directly from the distiller, then the regulation provides that the distiller must collect the markup from the military and remit that markup to the State Tax Commission; the same markup that would’ve been applicable had the military purchased the liquor from the State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.578" offset="1029726">Now, during the time at issue here, the markup with respect to distilled spirits was 17%, and with respect to wine was 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.041" offset="1071522">Now, there are four military bases in Mississippi which this Court explored on the first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.395" offset="1096913">There are two bases over which the United States maintains exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.456" offset="1121155">Those are the Keesler Air Force Base and the Naval Construction Battalion Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.778" offset="1142471">There are two other bases over which the United States and Mississippi maintain concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.898" offset="1170996">These are the Columbus Air Force Base and the Meridian Naval Air Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.966" offset="1191267">Now prior to 1966, Mississippi was a dry state, but even during that time, the military purchased liquor from the out of State distillers.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.260" offset="1232436">Now after 1966 when the new statute came into effect, the military continued the same practice of purchasing liquor from out of State distillers directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.700" offset="1278203">Now, after Regulation 25 became effective, which essentially told the military that even if they had continued their past procurement practice, they were going to have to pay over the tax to the Mississippi Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.776" offset="1338493">The military attempted to persuade the Mississippi State Tax authorities that the collection of this tax on direct purchases was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.573" offset="1373706">As a means of providing of some kind of interim accommodation, the military suggested that the amount of taxes at issue be paid into an escrow fund, and kept there until the matter could be judicially determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.162" offset="1432012">But Mississippi rejected that suggestion and in fact warned distillers that if they did not pay over the tax to the State Tax Commission on their direct sales to the military, they would be subject to the criminal penalties that were -- which were imposed on the Alcoholic Beverage Act, and they would also be subject to delisting, which essentially meant they would loose their privileges to sell their products to the State Tax Commission for retailing in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.099" offset="1547786">So because of this onerous position taken by Mississippi, the military had no choice, at least for the interim, to pay the amount of tax that Mississippi claimed to be due and owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.691" offset="1610167">As of July 1971, the record indicates that there was some $650,000.00 collected, and now, military advised me that as of the beginning of this year, the sum is something like $1,250,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.537" offset="1673488">Now this particular suit was brought in 1969 before a three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.674" offset="1702118">The United States asked for three modes of relief; a declaration that Regulation 25 was unconstitutional because it imposed a tax upon federal instrumentalities, an injunction against its further enforcement, and a money judgment in the amount of the taxes that had thus far been collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.587" offset="1777768">Now the first time around, the three-judge District Court simply held that the Twenty-first Amendment preempted the entire field, and that that empowered the State of Mississippi to impose this tax on sales to military purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.779" offset="1850493">On the first direct appeal, this Court reversed and vacated the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.707" offset="1874213">It held with respect to the exclusive jurisdiction basis that the Twenty-first Amendment had no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.320" offset="1904619">The reason and that the majority of this Court indicated was simply that the Twenty-first Amendment which speaks of importation of alcoholic beverages into any state did not apply to the exclusive jurisdiction bases, because those bases as the District Court itself acknowledged in its first consideration might as well have been in a sister state or in a foreign country, they simply are not part of the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.666" offset="2010049">But the court did not reach the issues which are now before it for resolution, that is questions of intergovernmental immunity and with respect to both the exclusive jurisdiction bases and the concurrent jurisdiction bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.934" offset="2075146">Now on remand, the District Court again dismissed the federal government suit and it did so by holding that the tax at issue here was on the out of State distiller and not on the military purchases so that there was no, supposedly, no unconstitutional tax on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.842" offset="2154768">The District Court further held that even if a tax were on the military purchaser, Congress had consented to the tax, and the District Court rejected the Government’s constitutional tax immunity doctrine argument on the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.763" offset="2218402">Now, before I begin to talk about what the parties disagree about, I think it ought to be -- I think it would be helpful to the Court if I set forth what our three points of agreement between the United States and the State of Mississippi in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.209" offset="2276185">To begin with, the parties are in agreement with the District Court’s conclusion that the State’s Regulation 25 imposes a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.966" offset="2311189">Secondly, that the parties are in agreement with the District Court’s finding that the ship stores, the officer’s clubs and the post exchanges involved in these cases on both the exclusive jurisdiction bases and on the concurrent jurisdiction bases are federal instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.318" offset="2376600">As federal instrumentalities, as arms of the federal government, they are entitled to whatever immunity from state taxation that the United States would enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.229" offset="2416306">And thirdly, the parties agree with the District Court’s statement in this case that the constitutional principle of federal tax immunity which this Court has reaffirmed on many occasions, applies only to bar a tax whose legal incidence falls upon the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.955" offset="2487150">So, putting aside those three points of agreement, I would like to now turn to what we think is the essential point in this case, and that is the error of the District Court’s holding that the legal incidence of this tax is not on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.127" offset="2559875">Now, the District Court construe the term legal incidence, which this Court has used many times, to mean the legally enforceable liability --</text>

            <text syncTime="642.216" offset="2672201">I think the Court has on occasion in its intergovernmental immunity cases stated that what the state’s highest construction of its statute is certainly persuasive, but in the Agricultural Bank case upon which we heavily rely, I think the Court also said that “As since it doesn’t involve a constitutional principle, that the Court feels free to reexamine the basis of that state court’s holding.”</text>

            <text syncTime="826.142" offset="3407914">Well, we’re fully in agreement with the fact that Agricultural Bank did not involve a constitutional holding because the court rested the immunity of national banks in that case upon a federal statute, the federal statute of long standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.736" offset="3458278">It was revised statutes, but I’m not sure that our -- my opposition really addresses itself to what we think is the critical point of Agricultural Bank, and that is the mode of analysis that the court used to construe the term legal incidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="861.901" offset="3550960">They do place some emphasis upon that, but I think that the court in Agricultural Bank simply said that in fact, it’s really right at the end because of the same point was made in Agricultural Bank and the court right at the end of its opinion said “It seems clear to us that the force of the law is such that regardless of sanctions, businessmen will attempt in their everyday commercial affairs to conform to its provisions as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.964" offset="3655241">Now, the provisions as written in the Massachusetts tax and in this tax require the out of State distiller to pass on the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.396" offset="3684916">And indeed if there would be any question about the construction of Regulation 25, the State of Mississippi issued a warning to the out of State distillers saying that they had to collect the tax from the military purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.206" offset="3748237">That warning is set forth in the appendix at page 38 and 39.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.307" offset="3764642">It’s a letter from the Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division, which says “Said fee must be invoiced to the military and collected directly from the military or other authorized organization located on the military base.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.723" offset="3818245">” And the letter concludes by saying “In addition to penalties imposed by law, products presently sold by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division will be delisted” and that is underlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.250" offset="3864325">I think that if there would be any question of construction, I think that the administrative position that the state tax authorities took indicated that the out of State distiller had to pass on this tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.191" offset="4028165">Those cases like James against Dravo and Alabama versus King &amp; Boozer on which the opposition relies, and I think turn really in part on -- really turn on the question of who is the purchaser in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.342" offset="4248743">The question was, then, who was the purchaser and the Court finally determined that the purchaser in that case was the private contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.683" offset="4278105">We don’t have any private contractor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.847" offset="4286777">I mean, this is simply a question the federal government is dealing for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.812" offset="4310601">Now once one recognizes that the tax is on the military purchaser that the legal incidence of the tax is on the military purchaser, then it cannot be valid, then It is unconstitutional, unless Congress has consented to the tax, or in this case since we’re involved with alcoholic beverages, unless the Twenty-first Amendment holds some sway in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.427" offset="4405060">Now, I would like to -- our analysis now proceeds along two separate lines because we have two kinds of bases involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.309" offset="4444557">We have the exclusive jurisdiction bases and we have the concurrent jurisdiction bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.612" offset="4461798">Now, on the exclusive jurisdiction bases, it is plain that the Twenty-first Amendment has no application because that was essentially the core of this Court’s conclusion on the first direct appeal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="1103.727" offset="4518327">The instrumentality argument is the same, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.606" offset="4529821">So, the -- with respect to Keesler and the Naval Construction Battalion Center, the Twenty-first Amendment has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.601" offset="4561795">So the only other avenue under which the tax could be sustained would be if Congress had given consent to such a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.590" offset="4593768">Now, Mississippi and it relies upon the District Court’s conclusion that Section 105 (a) of the Buck Act provides such consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.959" offset="4631176">Now that statute is set forth in our appendix to our brief at page 46, and it essentially says that “No person shall be relieved from liability for payment of any sales or used tax levied by any state on the ground that the sale or use with respect to which the tax was levied, occurred in whole or in part within a federal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.043" offset="4723545">” So as far as the District Court read that language and said “That constitutes congressional consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.180" offset="4748100">” We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.378" offset="4752906">We don’t think that the Buck Act -- that that provision of the Buck Act can be read in isolation, because when Congress passed the Buck Act, it just didn’t enact Section 105, but it also enacted Section 107, which we have reproduced directly thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.699" offset="4806196">And that says that “The provisions of Section 105 shall not be deemed to authorize the levy or collection of any tax on or from the United States or any instrumentality thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.191" offset="4848097">” Now, all the Section 105 (a) of the Buck Act does is to put a federal enclave on the same footing as the normal territory of a state with respect to the imposition of the tax, in other words -- or say the specified tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.096" offset="4915806">In other words, the Government -- a tax payer cannot say “My transaction took place in the federal enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.446" offset="4937122">That is not a sufficient defense after Congress passed the Buck Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.124" offset="4959901">But what Congress did simultaneously and the hearings are replete with testimony from people who came forward and were afraid that Congress was about to whittle away at the constitutional doctrines long expounded by this Court as early as Chief Justice Marshall, that federal instrumentalities might be in danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.563" offset="5041612">So Congress enacted Section 107 to reaffirm that doctrine of -- that which goes back M’Culloch versus Maryland that the states cannot impose a tax upon federal instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.361" offset="5088841">Now, if we are right as we submit we are, that the tax, the legal incidence of tax falls upon the federal instrumentality, then the Buck Act supplies no congressional consent because Section 107 (a) of the Buck Act constitutes an explicit reservation by Congress and reaffirmation of the protection that fellow instrumentalities are supposed to have from state taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.499" offset="5185390">Now, turning to the concurrent jurisdiction bases, there are different considerations that are applied because here, we have -- the Twenty-first Amendment is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.117" offset="5235858">The concurrent jurisdiction bases over which the United States and Mississippi exercise simultaneous sovereignty are part of the State of Mississippi, but we also have a competing constitutional doctrine here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.465" offset="5289253">We have the doctrine of federal tax immunity which I just deluded to as, you know, expressed in Section 107 (a) of the Buck Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.698" offset="5322167">Now, we submit that nothing in the history or the terms of the Twenty-first Amendment suggest that there were supposed to be an exception for alcoholic beverages with respect to the federal tax immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.858" offset="5378800">The legislative history and the statements on the floor of the Congress by its sponsors specifically make reference to the fact that it was not to alter the fundamental principles of federalism upon which the nation was founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.690" offset="5438151">What we have here is simply a design of Congress to give back to the states control over liquor which the federal government had preempted during the period of prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.353" offset="5492799">Now the Court has had on previous occasion’s two opportunities which we think are instructive here to balance the policy of the Twenty-first Amendment when it conflicts with other provisions of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.957" offset="5555179">The two cases to which we make reference to in our brief are the Hostetter versus Idlewild Bon Voyage Corporation case and the Department of Revenue versus James Beam Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.030" offset="5599483">Those cases, decided both on the same day, dealt with situations whom which two conflicting provisions of the constitution collided so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.123" offset="5643891">Now, in Hostetter what you had essentially was the State of New York had attempted to shut down an airport liquor retailer which sold liquor to departing international passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.366" offset="5712854">The State of New York attempted to do this, grounded its regulatory authority that the establishment was unlicensed and unlicensable on the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.494" offset="5761337">Now, the retailer though on the other hand pointed to the fact that he was engaged in international commerce, and that the Commerce Clause of Article I, which says that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the several states and between foreign nations apply and that that made the state’s power subordinate under the Twenty-first Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.828" offset="5870634">He also pointed to the fact that the Bureau of Customs had licensed him under the Tariff Act, which presumably was passed by Congress under its Article I power to regulate commerce with foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.910" offset="5915042">And what the Court did was essentially was to say that it is right that the Twenty-first Amendment gives the states power over to regulate liquor, but here where we have a competing consideration, that is a consideration of international commerce, the amendment has to yield.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.894" offset="5978990">Now, to the extent that the legislative history of the Twenty-first Amendment indicates if Twenty-first Amendment is to have any impact at all, it is in the impact of commerce, because it’s supposed to lessen whatever potential Commerce Clause problems might be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.362" offset="6048789">But even so, the court felt that the competing considerations of international commerce required that the Twenty-first Amendment be subordinated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.781" offset="6086510">Now, we think that that case -- that this case is -- would seem to follow a fortiori because we’re not dealing with a situation where the Commerce Clause is even remotely applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.478" offset="6129246">What we’re dealing with here is Article VI of the Supremacy Clause upon which this Court has announced in unbroken line of decision saying that because this constitution is the supreme law of the land, the United States cannot be subject to the taxation by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.718" offset="6202284">Now the James Beam Company case is really just offers another example of that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.583" offset="6221720">James -- the tax involved was a Kentucky tax on state liquor -- on the importation of Scotch whiskey, and that conflicted with the Export-Import Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.220" offset="6272293">Again, the Court subordinated the Twenty-first Amendment to the Export-Import Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.037" offset="6295489">And we would suggest that similarly, the Twenty-first Amendment with respect to the concurrent jurisdiction bases be subordinated to the federal tax immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.872" offset="6342823">I would like to save the -- my remaining time unless there are other questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.369" offset="6396844">I think it’s clear from the argument you’ve just heard that the validity of this tax depends on who is taxed for doing what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.946" offset="6431117">Now, the tax is not laid by the regulation, it is laid by a state statute of Mississippi, and the tax is laid on the business of wholesaling liquor within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.644" offset="6477928">The state has preempted for itself that business and the tax takes the form of a collection of the difference between the wholesaler’s price and the price of the retailer, less of course, whatever wholesaling cost the state may incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.025" offset="6559431">Now, the regulation gives the military an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.861" offset="6594853">I take it they’re not complaining about the option because an option is not a burden, an option is a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.172" offset="6620035">What the regulation does is give them a flexibility they wouldn’t otherwise have by allowing them to order direct in certain instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.716" offset="6670190">But when they do order direct from the distiller, this distiller then of course is sharing in the state’s wholesale monopoly and must account to the state for the state’s wholesale markup, which is the tax, the difference between the wholesaler’s price and the price to the retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.650" offset="6757961">Now, those prices are not set by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.932" offset="6771127">Each distiller sets his own price.</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.711" offset="9326216">You’ll recall in the Yosemite Park case, the federal government had exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over the Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.743" offset="9362369">The state however, when it had ceded the Park, a land had reserved general taxing rights and so the Court when it decided the case held that California could not impose license fees on the Interior Department concessionaire in that case, but that it could and did impose its wholesaler’s excise tax on that retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.087" offset="9475741">Now, that was done notwithstanding the fact that the retailer had in that case bought his liquor outside the state, but he had bought it for resale inside the state, which is exactly what the courts were talking about here, were made for, and you have precisely the same kind of a tax, a tax on wholesale transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.165" offset="9588067">And as the Yosemite case held the fact that in that case, direct collection was made of that wholesale sales tax from the federal retailer did not invalidate the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.287" offset="12136469">Now this regulation, the military regulation we’re talking about is one which is not to even purport to implement the Armed Services Procurement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.421" offset="12185057">It’s a regulation issued under the Draft Extension Act, the Act extending the manpower draft in 1951, which doesn’t mention taxes, doesn’t say anything about standards for the federal procurement of supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.707" offset="12266245">Now, one thing more I wanted to -- there is therefore no -- there’s no federal statute that’s in conflict with anything of the state is doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.946" offset="12335208">There’s one thing more I want to add that that record that the military’s own regulation provides that these retailers can’t sell at prices more than 10% lower than what the civilian retailers in the same area are charging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.530" offset="12401455">So that the only effect of giving the military an even lower price than what they now get would simply to be to increase the profits the military retailers at the expense of state revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.774" offset="12462477">Now, that is only one thing more I want to point that as far as the constitution is concerned, there’s certainly is no conflict between the Tenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.628" offset="12545860">The Tenth Amendment is now the state source of taxing powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.461" offset="12565191">States have been taxing fully in excise taxes on sales of liquor ever since they were colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.059" offset="12595597">The first one was laid by the Massachusetts colony in 1646, and this, at the time the constitution was adopted, revenue from liquor sales was an important source of revenue for all of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.762" offset="12682428">And what you’re talking about here is not depriving the United States of any right it may have to tax liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.045" offset="12711581">It too can tax liquor for its purposes, but what the Government is arguing here is that the state cannot tax liquor sales that are made to these military clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.759" offset="12790366">Although, this whole wholesale excise taxation is historically a right they were exercising and it was preserved to them when the Tenth Amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.049" offset="12839581">If the Tenth Amendment means anything at all today, it certainly means that the state’s right to tax liquor was not impaired by any other provisions of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.596" offset="12893706">Now that -- I want to say one word about the Agricultural Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.358" offset="12928815">As counsel pointed out it is not a tax immunity, and not constitutional tax immunity only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.533" offset="12957550">It has really nothing to do, as I see it, whether the problem you’re presented here which deals with the taxation of liquor rests on an entirely different phase than the taxation of National Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.812" offset="13006660">What M’Culloch against Maryland did of course was Maryland did try to own federal affliction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.193" offset="13036126">Maryland tried to impose a tax on the creation of currency by the Bank of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.888" offset="13058905">They wanted the state banks to have the only right to create currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.048" offset="13075519">That’s the kind of state tax that very clearly impairs a federal function and there is no such impairment involved here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.705" offset="13126196">The tax that’s been laid on these wholesale sales doesn’t prevent these military clubs from doing anything that they’re authorized and expected to do, and that is buy and sell liquor cheaper than any one else and earn a profit on the sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.380" offset="13304874">Essentially, what its -- point of it is, is that if the legal incidence of the tax is on the wholesaler, assuming arguendo, then you have a situation where the wholesaler is told by the State of Mississippi “If you sell to us the state, you don’t have to pay any tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.415" offset="13373001">If you sell to the Government, you’ve got to pay a tax.”</text>
