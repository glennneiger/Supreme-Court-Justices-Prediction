            <label>Ms. Oretta D. Sears</label>
            <text syncTime="32.990" offset="235290">-- may the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.305" offset="248560">I think listening to the contempt case I have somewhat lost my voice but hopefully as I proceed it will become clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.514" offset="305403">What is before the Court today is a many issued case, however, I do believe that the Court indicated by the postponement of the jurisdiction to this day that it wish to hear argument on whether or not there was jurisdiction in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.386" offset="416893">In directing myself to that issue, I would like to proceed by arguing that both of the orders issued by the court below, be it the order of June 4th which required the people to return the movies or the films and the order of due of September 30th which ordered the -- defendant -- defendants in “good faith” petitioned the state court for the return of the film are injunctive in determining.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.229" offset="648338">First of all, I would like to argue that a declaratory judgment in the sense in an action that involves a state statute is to my way of thinking per se injunctive within the context of 1253, within the context of 2281 and 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.257" offset="800371">A look at the birth of these statutes brings us back to ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.183" offset="844152">But when I read the ex parte Young and I started from there and I went back and reread a lot of the very brilliant decisions by members of this Court and by past members of the Court, I was impressed by one thing, that what ex parte Young dealt with was one portion of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.834" offset="946657">Not really, not at all, the portion of whether or not the Court or the judicial, the federal court per se as the judicial system had jurisdiction over seven causes of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.949" offset="1011127">For indeed that's the first portion of the amendment but what that case dealt with I think is expressed best in the -- in Justice Harlan's dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.105" offset="1055744">It dealt with that second portion which said, ”And in those cases in which a state is a party, jurisdiction -- original jurisdiction shall be in the United States Supreme Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="252.792" offset="1114572">It was that second limitation that was argued in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.449" offset="1137142">The question was when there is a state statute that is at that through the Attorney General or through the state personnel representative is it the state that's being attacked or is the individual and the majority with an opinion --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="280.275" offset="1224495">We'll resume there 1 o'clock Mrs. Sears.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.291" offset="1296488">Mrs. Sears you may continue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oretta_d_sears" startTime="299.477" stopTime="846.749">
            <label>Ms. Oretta D. Sears</label>
            <text syncTime="299.477" offset="1301295">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.261" offset="1312371">What I was trying to or attempting to point out is that in a very real sense what ex parte Young did was to take away a suit against the Attorney General of the state or state officer in which the declaration or a statute is being attacked for unconstitutionality from the original jurisdiction provision inherent in the Constitution which states that whenever the state is a party to a proceeding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.846" offset="1514768">It was to remedy this particular ill that in 1911 the original three-judge court provisions were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.789" offset="1562520">I think the -- probably the clearest showing of the intent of Congress at that time to provide full direct appeal in all of those cases where a decision was to be made by the three-judge court and where a finding of unconstitutionality was added, is found in the original provision in 1911th provision in which the three-judge court which was sought to be a panel was intended to be made up of at least of one judge plus two additional judges, at least one of whom was going to be either a Supreme Court judge or a Circuit Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.732" offset="1778291">Now, quite obviously once the decision is issued from a three-judge court, at least one of whom but possibly two of whom are Supreme Court judges it would be rather in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.618" offset="1845896">At that point to go to a Ninth -- or a Circuit Court to have that decision reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.489" offset="1881318">Now, true today the Act has been modified so that it does not anymore say at least one of whom can be either a Supreme Court or a Circuit Court but it does still say at least one of whom and again at least one of whom shall be a Circuit Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.733" offset="1966268">Arguably therefore one could have a three-judge court with two Circuit Court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.031" offset="2003466">I suppose one could go and go to the Ninth Circuit that demand a hearing and then but I would question the wisdom of trying to overrule a two-judge court decision with two judges from the Ninth Circuit sitting on it and deciding the case, it would make it somewhat in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.708" offset="2114226">That's one of the points.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.213" offset="2120182">The other point is that interestingly enough the Act does not say prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.476" offset="2153305">It defines injunction within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.240" offset="2164381">It says an injunction to restrain the enforcement and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.835" offset="2194683">It would restrain as this Court has recognized does not mean to just prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.259" offset="2216417">It means anything less than an actual prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.672" offset="2234075">It means anything which makes it difficult, which inhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.892" offset="2258944">I think this is true of the First Amendment cases and of all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.067" offset="2279633">It's certainly true that a bill quia timet for indeed that is what declaratory judgment is a restraint especially in view of some of the new decisions which have stated that recently I believe it was the Second Circuit or the Third Circuit stated that a -- after the declaratory judgment, a proceeding against the person involved contrary to the declaration of unconstitutionality was automatically an action which was in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.156" offset="2447966">Now, had I read that opinion, I would have been a lot more cautious if before ever bringing a state proceeding after the declaration of the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.187" offset="2512123">So long as that opinion exists, I am restrained in the future from ever doing it again, even though in good faith I believe I am right.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.591" offset="2561755">I still couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.158" offset="2568025">So it is a real restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.032" offset="2579519">Finally, if we speak about a case in which the three-judge court is properly convened and if -- excuse me, and if we have a valid request for injunction and if the request for injunction is denied but the declaratory relief is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.079" offset="2683695">What are the results?</text>
            <text syncTime="646.824" offset="2690696">The practical result is that the state who is the one that was sought to be protected, whose procedures was not to be speeded all the way to this Court will be the one defendant that will not be able to reach this Court directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.054" offset="2779617">Whereas, if the relief had been denied, all of it and the Act had been found constitutional, the defendant, the individual, would be able to come directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.425" offset="2849102">And I think this inconsistency is -- was not intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.955" offset="2875225">I think that a declaration of unconstitutionality unless this Court is willing to say that beyond 1201 we take 1202 and destroy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.170" offset="2924022">It is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.647" offset="2929977">A Court who has the power to issue declaration also has the power to enforce that declaration under 1201 and probably within the purview of 2283 as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.683" offset="2986088">And it seems to me that then in that case we have a bypassing of the totality of the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.102" offset="3019734">Now, a point that is also somewhat important is the fact that there is another strength, there is a possibly res judicata restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.721" offset="3086294">Now, that too is a restraint because if the state court feels that -- if the people feel that the declaratory judgment is going to be res judicata in the state court really there isn't much point in bringing the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.102" offset="3155780">So therefore, I would submit that if we are going to allow a declaratory judgment to be given in these cases and I think we have to, I don't think that's open for question then I think that the Court must preserve the rights to appeal by declaring that the declaratory judgment is per se in these type of cases injunctive and that it restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.603" offset="3269778">The second point of course is that both of these as far as the first order, the order to return it's obvious under the Ledesma rationale that it is injunctive but the second order is probably even more injunctive to my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.207" offset="3348250">It opens me to a contempt to which I almost find inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.153" offset="3371969">I cannot in good faith, that's the impossibility in good faith do that which I do not believe in, how do I in good faith petition my Court whom I have asked to do something and who has issued a valid order and has rendered a valid judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.399" offset="3456920">Now I have to go back and say “I don't believe I'm wrong but they tell me I have to do it in good faith so Your Honors, I will do it!”</text>

            <text syncTime="926.447" offset="3809155">Those are the considerations that I felt were probably most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.037" offset="3847502">I do realize that there had been problems, procedural problems, rule problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.442" offset="3881148">A petition was filed under Rule 60 noticed however for July 1, unless I have read as much as time and physical limitation allowed as many of the opinions and I came to the conclusion that the rule part of the problem did not seem to be so achieved perhaps I am wrong but I felt that since the case is here totally and there is nothing more to be done downstairs at any event, I did not feel that that I need to go too much into that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.529" offset="4049481">And if the Court feels that I should quite then I will address it more specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.416" offset="4077066">Now, the one point that I would like to make is the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.398" offset="4124923">The state court magistrate issued for search warrants for I as the head of the written appeals section automatically direct my deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.123" offset="4195871">They will issue it over the weekend however, or a Thursday or Friday any weekend interferes on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.190" offset="4224084">I felt very strongly that the mandate of this Court require an immediate hearing as soon as possible and I felt very strongly that under Rule 41 analogy, Rule 41 and 1538.5, I should premise are almost identical, if not identical in scope and language and I know many cases the Second Circuit cases and other cases that have held that Rule 41 does allow the Court to have that kind of a hearing at the instance of the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.401" offset="4397014">And so I asked for that kind of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.132" offset="4415927">The defendants in the state action or in -- at that hearing arrived and said “begging your pardon Court you have no jurisdiction, goodbye!”</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.033" offset="4471515">Well, at that point we proceeded with the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.336" offset="4496697">Right or wrong, I feel very strongly that that kind of issue belonged in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.962" offset="4531179">And that the Court in granting relief actually showed itself totally opposed to allowing the courts to do their job, the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.568" offset="4597635">In addition, if we are ever going to have the resolution of this issue, I tried it again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.001" offset="4651342">They come in and said “begging your pardon, but we don't feel bound by this Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.482" offset="4677256">I think the hearing of August 12 which has been brought up as part of the record by the appellees is graphic of what has been happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.796" offset="4730546">The federal court in that case although it did not pursue the issue further asked the defense or the plaintiff's counsel, “Why didn't you appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.621" offset="4785821">Did you -- don't you think the Courts of the Supreme Court of the State of California would have gone your way?”</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.864" offset="10306853">So we have a ruling in the state court which they did not appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2579.285" offset="10420537">And they've consistently refused to present to the state courts the question of obscenity and it's set out here in the record very plainly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2820.936" offset="11387068">At that time, we had a complaint in which we asked for injunctive relief and for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.260" offset="11416430">Judge Ferguson stated that he had been the city attorney of Buena Park where all of this occurred that he in fact had founded the charter of the city and did not want to do anything that would seem improper under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.402" offset="11493021">And therefore he reclused himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.985" offset="11503261">Subsequently, after the three-judge court was convened, we withdrew from our complaint all request for money damages, so that damages were then out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.218" offset="11568253">And within that framework, where there was no longer being any money asked against the chief of police whom Mr. Judge Ferguson had previously represented, Judge Ferguson felt that there was then no longer any reason for him not to sit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.467" offset="13385226">We will not read into our California statute something that the legislature did not put into it, so that there was no attempt made in Enskat which is the authoritative phase decided in California after Miller was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.438" offset="13445099">There was no attempt there to say we are going to put specificity into the law if it was not otherwise there, so that there is no question, but that if the California courts had chosen to give specificity to the statute similar to the kind of specificity that Your Honors gave to 1461 by reading Miller into 1461, it would be an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.722" offset="13542275">But here, the California Court conceded that it didn't have really conceded that there wasn't the requisite specificity either in the statute or in the prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.799" offset="13582608">And what they said in Enskat was, you don't need that kind of specificity because California retains in its law the memoirs utterly without redeeming social value test and because that memoirs test was retained the Enskat decision said there was a fair tradeoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.482" offset="13661288">We got more than the Constitution required in having a memoirs value test therefore we didn't have to get all that we were entitled to under Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.199" offset="13700159">So that the question comes back to the fact that the statute on its phase plainly is defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.184" offset="13728057">It does not have any itemized sexual conduct and the decisions that existed in California at the time that Enskat looked at the statute did not have particularization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.606" offset="13773824">What we have in California are generalizations not particularizations and this is what the Court said in Enskat.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.947" offset="14155212">In Miller, the requirement that the prosecution come on with expert evidence to prove its case was withdrawn rendering a possible for finders of fact, judges or jury, to make determinations based on personal trade elections rather than some kind of objective standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.836" offset="14226683">In Miller, there was a shift to the jury as the Board of Census instead of having an appellate court acting as board of census.</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.702" offset="14322186">It's less predictable than censorship by an appellate court which everyone can look to, and know what the law is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3731.941" offset="15031150">That doesn't mean anything and struck down the Massachusetts statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.411" offset="15061034">Similarly, the District Court found that the requirement of graphic fictions of sexual activity clearly did not meet the requirement of some kind of a list which would give some kind of guidance to everybody so that you would know if it was in the troubled waters and if it wasn't that kind of conduct you were not in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.183" offset="15192064">The Court pointed out that there were many acts of sexual activity that may even be utterly without redeeming social value which is so innocuous as not to be included on the list enumerated by a legislature, example to come to mind of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.190" offset="15276178">Since in California we say that it's nudity with sexual activity the question comes to mind, can you reach a nude couple kissing mouth to mouth, that would not seem to fit the plain examples that we find in Miller and yet it would fit the general language of the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.341" offset="15388714">One thinks in terms of kissing toes, fingers, nose, neck, ears, hair, breast, all of which under the plain examples of Miller would not be covered and yet which could be covered under the general language that we find in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.845" offset="15490800">Now, the Attorney General takes the position quite out front and says that we do not need a blueprint, we do not need a blueprint of sexual activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.021" offset="15567496">Use the language of the Attorney General says, “Miller's demand for specificity does not require a detail statutory enumeration and description of all other types of sexual activities sought to be protected, such detail is not required under Roth" and then were back again, would Roth without Miller read into it satisfy the due process requirements today in light of Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.782" offset="15670523">And I submit with all deference that Roth without Miller read into it is unconstitutional under the Miller group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.959" offset="15711169">And then the Attorney General says, “relying on a statement of this Court that the Constitution does not require ultimate godlike precision," he says, therefore it is unnecessary that to avert the constitutional infirmity of vagueness, the statute must reside a detailed blueprint of the proscribed conduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.969" offset="15827257">So the question that we have here is, when concededly the state statute does not have any itemized list and when concededly the prior decisions of the state court do not have any itemized list and where the state court does not seek to correct the statute in any fashion because the state courts recognized that that is a legislative function and not a judicial function whether under those circumstances the statute was correctly found to the unconstitutional as it was by the District Court and we believe that the Court plainly was correct in its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.272" offset="16056508">The Court stated, the District Court stated that this Court in Miller set forth important First and Fifth Amendment principles central to a fair and recent system of criminal law when it insisted that an obscenity statute have an itemized list of the types of sexual conduct that may be reached under the obscenity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.949" offset="16155146">We respectfully submit that unless that portion of Miller is to be overruled, the District Court was plainly correct in its conclusion and I would say to Your Honors that if that specificity portion of Miller is to be overruled, then we are worse off than we were before when this Court said that Roth and Memoirs had created the state of chaos because then we would have even more chaos than we had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.399" offset="16273011">Thank you Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="4055.115" offset="16323793">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.565" offset="16345631">My responsibility is to take care of the procedural matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.691" offset="16362141">I do think that perhaps it would be helpful to make a statement, a very brief statement of the facts which appeared to have been overlooked by my colleagues on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.514" offset="16417416">And it's simply this, what happened here was that in the City of Buena Park that came the news that “Deep Throat” was going to be shown in that city.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.573" offset="16469661">Unwilling to have that film shown in the city, the District Attorney sent the two offices to look at the film in Hollywood where it was showing and has shown to over 8,000 papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.233" offset="16536325">They viewed the film, came back and prepared an affidavit which stated all tight up, which stated that they saw the film watched it for 60 minutes and it was nothing but one sexual act after another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.752" offset="16602363">No mention has made of theme or anything else, that's what they saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.102" offset="16619813">They then presented that to a Municipal Court judge and with the judge together with the officers proceeded to the theater in Buena Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.648" offset="16689925">They went in and saw the film, the findings of the district court below is that they stayed there 45 minutes, did not wait to see the entire film, came out and in the street, the judge directed the issuance of the warrant and at the same time where a camera was being -- a cameraman was taking a photograph of the scene ordered that the film be taken out of that cameraman because the Municipal Court judge was performing a judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.831" offset="16826702">Now, after that, they proceeded to seize the film and this was now at about the first showing on November 23, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.928" offset="16879052">Two hours later, another print of the film is at the theater and is being shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.510" offset="16913429">They had been told by the District Attorney, look for any difference, any difference at all and then you can get another warrant to seize.</text>

            <text syncTime="5494.325" offset="22080658">I just wish to answer by referring the Court to certain passages of the appendix that I think the Court has been wondering about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.398" offset="22124962">The appendix at page 82 shows the reason why we were not able to object to the three-judge court composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.605" offset="22169788">We were notified on February 8 of the existence of the three-judge court and the three-judge court order designating it where it was just found on pages 84 and 85 is dated January 8 and gave us two weeks from the January 8th date to complain about the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.130" offset="22259858">I found that was few time to attempt to do anything about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.669" offset="22278040">Number two, the appendix at page 89 shows that just this matter of course we did not have an evidentiary hearing because we were ordered to submit an affidavit and points in authorities and without oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.401" offset="22352959">As a matter of fact, I have never seen the three-judge court ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.627" offset="22373857">I know it exists but I've never seen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.919" offset="22387022">Page 20 of course do show the reason, page 36 Dr. John Smith's affidavit of that is the magistrate affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.290" offset="22436551">Pages 76, 77, 78 and 79 of the appendix show the true status as to the stipulation of the identity of the pictures, there was a stipulation for purposes of trial only.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.437" offset="22493080">We were going on appeal for two of the copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.609" offset="22505827">Page 45 of the appendix shows that which has been our consistent policy in these cases, one seizure and subsequently an adversary hearing and one more thing that I wish to correct, counsel states that the Court -- the state court is bound by Enskat only in the Superior Court only in the Municipal Court.</text>
