            <text syncTime="5.791" offset="126516">This case is here on the Government's petition to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing respondent’s conviction for transporting aliens who were present in this country illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.189" offset="180120">The reversal was predicated on the ground that the stopovers respondent's car and the ensuing inquiry as to the nationality of its occupants violated the Fourth Amendment, and the testimony of trial with the aliens who were being transported by respondent was the fruit of the poisonous tree, and that their testimony should have been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.735" offset="258278">Respondent was arrested on the evening of March 11, 1973 by two border patrol officers who were on duty on a patrol car, stationed at the San Clemente checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.360" offset="300805">The checkpoint was closed at the time due to inclement weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.063" offset="315643">The patrol car was parked at right angle to the highway with its headlights directed toward the highway in such a fashion that it could -- would illuminate the passing cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.266" offset="368410">The officers observe respondent's car passed by containing respondent and two passengers, all of whom to appeared to be of Mexican decent.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.985" offset="399339">They pursued and stopped the vehicle for what they characterized suppression hearing as a routine immigration inspection.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="83.679" offset="438105">They closed them for various reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.810" offset="450644">There is a concern about the effect of the checkpoint operation on the flow of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.075" offset="471646">And at times when traffic is heavy for instance on Sunday afternoon, they normally feel compelled to close the checkpoint down because it’s interfering too much with the normal flow of traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.896" offset="546983">The board -- well, that that is a problem and in our reply brief in Ortiz, we have a footnote which indicates what happened when one Sunday quite unexpectedly, they kept the checkpoint open, and they caught exceptionally large numbers of illegal entrance on that occasion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="133.510" offset="637367">Well, it is a problem and the border patrol believes that it its responsibility to attempt to balance its interest in apprehending aliens with the interest of motorist on the highway to proceed without a two-hour traffic jam.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.109" offset="699852">We try to avoid that kind of imposition on the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.785" offset="714480">Now of course, it does -- there are holes in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.147" offset="727960">It is possible for a skilled, knowledgeable smuggler and many of the alien smugglers are highly sophisticated.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.478" offset="757321">They have drop houses and near the border, they have scouts who go ahead and phone back and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.122" offset="783862">It is possible for -- to evade the system, and that is not air tight.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.878" offset="834853">There was reference to in occasion when this strict border search that Mr. Justice White alluded to was enforced for some period of time, resulted in diplomatic representations by the Mexican Government to the state department of the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="202.563" offset="913638">I would say though that even at the border, the question of how closely they search people's bags, how many people, what proportion of the entrance arriving at the port of entry or search at the Dallas Airport of something will depend on the volume of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.078" offset="975705">If there’s a three 747's that just come in with a large number of people, checking is going to be somewhat more cursory, more people will probably passed through by customs without a care for search of their baggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.889" offset="1022934">These are the accommodations to the exigencies of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.663" offset="1046026">In any event in this case, they questioned the passengers in English which they appeared not to understand, and then in Spanish concerning their citizenship, and they discovered that the passengers had no papers authorizing them to be in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.367" offset="1104854">Respondent and the passengers where then arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.167" offset="1120005">The suppression hearing took place prior to this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez and there was a quite cursory exploration of the circumstances surrounding the stop.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="264.807" offset="1162637">Well, there was a motion made by respondent to suppress testimony of the aliens as the fruit of an illegal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.803" offset="1198582">At the time, it was I think quite clear to everybody on the Ninth Circuit law then that that motion had no hope of prevailing at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.259" offset="1232436">And as I say, the -- I think, it was actually held on the day of trial and denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.650" offset="1265977">The only inquiry into the particular reason for selecting respondent's car for a stop was made in the form of a couple of leading question asked on cross-examination by respondent’s counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.900" offset="1318954">Now on appeal, the Court of Appeals first considered the question of whether this was a roving patrol or a checkpoint stop and decided that it was more properly characterize as a roving patrol and we haven’t challenge that characterization here.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.762" offset="1378408">If the side of the roving patrol stops are invalid and the absence of a warrant or particularized found that suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.969" offset="1411218">I don't even think it's -- it didn't suggest that a warrant would do, but in this case of course, there was no warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.803" offset="1438595">It consider this conclusion to flow from the decision of this Court and in Almeida-Sanchez and from this Court’s reliance on Carroll which I point out Carroll is square with Almeida-Sanchez in the sense that Carroll involve a roving patrol search.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.475" offset="1521246">The other cases we have here are not -- are distinguishable from Carroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.647" offset="1537964">One on the basis that they involved checkpoints which we say are different and in this case that we're not seeking here the authority to search, but simply to stop and Carroll was not concerned with a pure stop, but rather with a search of Mr. Carroll’s car.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.181" offset="1612048">We submit that there is a substantial constitutionally significant difference between a search of an automobile and a stop for the purpose of briefly interrogating its occupants regarding their right to be in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.946" offset="1659173">And that with respect to stops within the reasonable distance of the Mexican border, this Court should honor the congressional judgment that warrant will stops for this limited purpose, a reasonable and proper to held enforce a vitally important congressional policy to limit the influx of aliens for residence in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.211" offset="1740257">In other words, if this were in Chicago, you wouldn't be defending it?</text>

            <text syncTime="418.178" offset="1776097">We would not -- we do not assert a right to stop cars on a random basis or without particularized suspicion in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.968" offset="1815280">There is an issue if we believe that a car contain an alien of if we believe that a pedestrian was an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.156" offset="1840044">Subsection 1 of the statute appears to confer a right to interrogate that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.827" offset="1862719">I basically rely in this case on Subsection 3 rather than on Subsection 1 of Section 287; that is I'm relying on the -- I'm contending that stop and question authority is necessarily encompass within the authority that Congress conferred to board and search.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.326" offset="1944639">And that although to the extent that purported to give that authority to search on roving patrols in Almeida-Sanchez, this Court held that invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.029" offset="1987480">We think that the lesser authority at stake in stopping and interrogating is constitutionally permissible and that the statute should be upheld in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.408" offset="2100955">I think we've tried to make it clear in our brief that we are not saying that we could setup a checkpoint on road between Omaha and Des Moine and do the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.461" offset="6577194">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.514" offset="6589419">I don't mind having my brief called superficial if the unbanked Ninth Circuit's reasoning is called superficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.935" offset="6619094">This case raises a constitutional question of the highest magnitude, and would be the contention of the respondent that Terry versus Ohio in the analysis in Adams versus Williams did not affectively answer any of the questions here because in Terry versus Ohio, there was an interference with the liberty of a person on the street which was held to constitute a seizure, such as to bring in to play the Fourth Amendment, and for such at seizure to take place, there must be objective, articulable facts to justify that seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.653" offset="6766007">This Court never reached the issue of interrogation at that point, but held that under the concept of the protective safety of the officer, the officer could pack down a minimum intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.220" offset="6832253">And I believe Mr. Justice White in his concurring opinion pointed out that the man could not be in anyway compelled to answer any questions under those circumstances that it had not been reached, even if there was that reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.158" offset="6895992">Further this Court in Adams versus Williams decided that there must be two requirements for such a momentary stop and relied upon Ninth Circuit precedent, Wilson versus Porter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.410" offset="6941027">Mr. Justice Rehnquist speaking for the court said one; I focus suspicion and two, facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.065" offset="6967672">The intrusions and both of those cases involved one, a person on the street, the other, a parked car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.894" offset="6998915">In this case, we have a car moving down the highway, an interstate highway flagged over by law enforcement officers at Wilmer Caprice for whatever reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.004" offset="7039352">There is a killer who is executed in California, Mr. Chessman for using the red light technique of flagging cars over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.231" offset="7068296">I would contend that that intrusion is of a most important magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.061" offset="7091597">I would start off by saying that the Government in this case is not giving you the full flavor of the statutory analysis involved that we are seeing a gut -- a visual reaction of the Government saying “we need these things, therefore we’re going to have it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.762" offset="7166412">There is a serious obstacle involved and it's not the checkpoints to alien traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.491" offset="7185324">It's that our Government was founded on the principle, over 200 years to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.229" offset="7204237">The famous James Otis case in 1761 with the writs of assistance, on that, we don't substantiate the hunches, the ESP, the sixth sense of law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.042" offset="7259512">In that case, the famous writ of assistance case, they ask merely customs officers to get untaxed goods in the port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.996" offset="7291382">And although with the English judges, they did get that right, which of course lead to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.730" offset="7314265">I'm saying that in this particular case, we are deeming with the point, some 66 road miles from the border, lot further and then Boston was from the external territorial limits of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.261" offset="7360449">The statutory history start in 1862 with the Collie Trade Act, and to that first statute, we have dealing with the regulation, a person from outside countries are racial tone involved most assuredly was that we required reasonable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.377" offset="7412903">The statutory history mounts forward, step-by-step; there is reasonable cause, probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.800" offset="7438608">In 1891, the predecessor as just Justice White analogized in his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.540" offset="7461491">We have 1225 (a) which is now Section 235 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.506" offset="7489390">That was the right at the border to exercise any powers of inspection, and that right was developed onto 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.116" offset="7523871">And in 1917, it was expanded to the first time to allow bordering and searching of vehicles which they, the officers believe are bringing aliens into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.404" offset="7569011">In 1925, just like Carroll, they've done for the law enforcement officer excused the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.772" offset="7590431">So, we now have a new section that pops up, ironically created an appropriation bill that gives an exception to the warrant under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.616" offset="7625853">That statute in 1925, the source of 287 today tracks identical language from the original one that says that they, when they believe that the vehicle is bringing aliens into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.221" offset="7684263">In 1946, the Attorney General and his one line letter said “We'd like to have the power to stop and search.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.158" offset="7716028">Congress merely gave them the right to continue boarding operation did not deal with the fundamental question now before this Court the right to interdict traffic on a highway moving throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.318" offset="7756675">We're dealing with a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.047" offset="7763571">In 1952, the limited legislative analysis which now creates both sections, 1357 (a) (1) and 1357 (a) (3) was early, but 1357 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.233" offset="7804322">We have there Congress saying at the border, we don't want indiscriminate questioning or harassment of citizens returning to the United States and would expect that even at the border, probable cause would be necessary to question citizens that they are committing a crime or about to commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.670" offset="7874017">That's the legislative history behind the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.795" offset="7882585">Justice -- Judge Browning in his dissent in Almeida-Sanchez referred to the fact that even the legislative history clearly announced that constitutional requirements will be consisted and interposed upon this statute and that the act have to be read in such a fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.880" offset="8786944">And the reason why is, is that by the all courts, even this Court has different viewpoints, there is sometimes accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.052" offset="8819545">And that the big point to made in 1357 (a) (1) is that with Carroll, and the interpretation in Almeida-Sanchez, even a stop, if one was to scrutinized Supreme Court precedent requires probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.995" offset="9851382">I would say there's two cases they cited, and I believe the Court does have the reply brief at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.395" offset="9872906">The first one they cite is Montes Hernandez, a District Court case appears at page 14 and 28 of the Principle Government brief in the footnote, and there, because of the heavy alien population in Sacramento, California or Bright, California, 500 miles from the border, the court upheld the right to stop and interrogate an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.301" offset="9952528">So, that's one demonstration of how 1357 (a) (1) is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.286" offset="9968515">The second example cited to us by the Government is in their reply brief on the last page, the last footnote to Saldana case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.038" offset="11563551">I think that a warrant can be tailored for a checkpoint based upon an analysis to use the Court’s reference to four points that were cited in your concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.335" offset="11600750">I think though that it has to be one, that complies with some procedure either annunciated by this Court in the opinion or that there would have to be some change in say Rule 41 or Federals and Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.151" offset="11651950">There is we called it a warrant for inspection in our area and there some equivocation as to how it works out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.595" offset="11673788">The difficulty comes and trying to make a showing and often, I feel that there is not a full adversary showing and we even tried to for example to get statistics on the aliens coming from the border at the San Clemente checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.718" offset="11726242">One, the border patrol denied this an opportunity to get such statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.046" offset="11739512">Two, we got an action for mandate pended on the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.946" offset="11751111">So that the question in this area is that we don't have access to some of this information and I feel that there should be some substantial showing made to a court, I don't know what to be called that could allow other parties to contest some of the facts to justify the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.368" offset="11808893">I think it is conceptually feasible as I've indicated in our brief that such a warrant could be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.397" offset="11828955">I think that as Mr. Savilla has point out that one of the key factors is proximity to the border in the sense that the Fifth Circuit analysis might be certainly, reasonable in the Hart case on Zero Blanca, but would be grossly unreasonable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.413" offset="11885066">For example the reason Mr. Savilla and I differ which Judge Turrentine, he held every checkpoint in the Southern District of California to be the functional equivalent of border, even San Clemente and although one might have conclusion to be reached, we might differ with the reasoning and the approach to that topic, and yet not foreclose the area that such warrants might be possible or that it could be considered a functional equivalent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.601" offset="12393827">I would point out further to the Court that one of the most serious concerns in this case was that this defendant, now respondent, was stop because the three occupants appeared of Mexican decent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.835" offset="12466761">Number one; the driver is a Spanish speaking Puerto Rican American citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.578" offset="12889736">It's our contention that you can't use race alone, possibly is one of many factors it can be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.382" offset="13324936">Your Honor, the only thing I can suggest is that factors would determine in a multiplicity circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.685" offset="13346147">If I followed along the border and I saw footprints running in a mile, it would be to a certain bush; I go walk up and found the man as the bush, I would say that's a factor to believe that that person is an alien, and yet I haven’t talk to him, I don’t know how to addressing him by his race and I think, I would have a right as a law enforcement officer to stop him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.942" offset="13415111">But to give you something that I could go by physical appearance in these days, where the freedom of the individuals are so protected, I can’t give you any basis that would justify on appearance alone of a stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.050" offset="13459623">They would rise to the level founded suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.521" offset="13469445">In Terry versus Ohio, was the man walking back and forth outside the jewelry, sufficient to justify the stop and the answer was, the court held it took 20 minutes of watching the conduct, the experience officer, and at that time, the had probably -- even probable cause to believe a conspiracy to rub was take in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.395" offset="13544991">My contention is that you can't use the fact of a -- now, if he had on made to Mexico on his back, on a shirt or Tijuana, then maybe that might be an appearance factor that will help out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.177" offset="13592116">But I'm hard press to give you any facts that would suit this case where an officer at Wilmer Caprice some 66 miles from the border could stop a car on the basis of appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.365" offset="13632867">I can't say old cars or new cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.005" offset="13643421">In fact, what shocks me is the Government in the reply brief in Otis say that you can tell a Mexican resident because they’re thin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.927" offset="13671111">How many fat aliens have I represented?</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.754" offset="13678425">You contest because they have coarse hands, that they ware coarse clothes; they have their haircut in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.922" offset="13703084">I've had my haircut once or twice in Tijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.014" offset="13715414">The point I'm trying to say is that there are facts but the facts are difficult and the reason is there's a balancing of interest.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3445.311" offset="13884583">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.218" offset="13892211">I think in effect, you've just heard my opponent say that there is no basis on which we can constitutionally stop cars at the San Clemente checkpoint or any distance in from the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.188" offset="13940172">Now, we think that just to stop a car and ask people about their citizenship is a limited intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.156" offset="13976012">We think this is an important distinction from Camara.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.186" offset="13988133">The warrant issue which I was unable to reach in my opening argument is treated simply well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.342" offset="14012792">In Camara warrant was required and therefore, we can't rely on Camara.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.593" offset="14029720">Well of course in Camara, there were searching a -- what was arguably a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.878" offset="14050931">The power they asserted was a power to assert homes and to search homes and then see the power to search business premises which the court treated as homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.944" offset="14091160">Here, we are talking about not a search but a stop and not a home but a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.194" offset="14112162">These factors make a difference not only in the constitutional reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment, but in the necessity for a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.054" offset="14143613">Now with respect to the question of whether a warrant is needed, I think that -- the answer is not simply whether we could get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.241" offset="14184364">We have problems about getting warrants, but that would be true of the border also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.991" offset="14203382">We could easily get warrants for the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.584" offset="14213726">We could get warrants that would say where we could setup our ports of entry, warrants that would try to describe who we could stop, how we could go about searching people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.755" offset="14250402">There isn't a logical difference between at least the checkpoints and the border ports of entry from the standpoint of could we get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.253" offset="14288436">I don't think the answer that we could get a warrant is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.721" offset="14302229">Now, there are problems about our ability to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.924" offset="14315081">Roving patrol operations cover amenced variety of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.495" offset="14333367">They can be an operation like this totally unexpected due to bad weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.932" offset="14347055">Now, possibly are San Clemente checkpoint warrant could encompass the authority to make roving patrol stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.449" offset="14377148">But we have other situations, we have farm checks during the harvest season when we expect us likely for migrant workers to be moving from farms in the southern area to farms in the northern area, we send the patrol car around on the farm roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.229" offset="14440260">We see a truck drive by with the group of migrant workers; we may stop and check the citizenship of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.230" offset="14472338">There is in a sense in issues suppose that a border patrol car is driving along the road and it sees a car drive by, six persons who appear to be Mexicans and I think that to ask the officer to ignore that fact would be to ignore the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.936" offset="14559065">Seating uncomfortably nervously looking away from him, he's suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.851" offset="14582784">He is -- he can't maybe articulate more than that which my opponent says it's not enough, but the question is can he just stop the car and say can I inquire about your citizenship and make a brief inquiry of that nature?</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.323" offset="14640671">Now, we think that’s not the kind of thing that could be really subjected to a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.237" offset="14656345">In affect, Congress says may the judgment, the warrant judgment that we should be allowed to do this, and we urge this Court to sustain that judgment and allow roving patrol stops for interrogation without warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.425" offset="14705037">Thank you.</text>
