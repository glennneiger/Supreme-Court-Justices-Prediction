            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The last two cases are 73-765, International Garment Workers v. Quality Manufacturing Co. and 73-1363, National Labor Relations Board v. Weingarten.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.518" offset="62067">The first on cert from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the second on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.547" offset="98116">They are companion cases presenting the same question namely, whether an employer commits an unfair labor practice by refusing an employee's request that the employee be accompanied by a union representative at an interview with the employer that the employee reasonably believes may result in disciplinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.349" offset="197381">In quality, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and in Weingarten, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the employer did not commit an unfair labor practice in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.582" offset="246282">We disagree and reverse the judgment of each Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.125" offset="264464">We hold that it was within the competence of the Board to find that although some earlier Board precedents may be read as reaching a contrary conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.187" offset="308663">The Board's accumulating experience with the problems justified its holding that the employer's refusal constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of Section 8 (a) (1) as an interference with the right of the employee protected by Section 7 to engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.606" offset="398420">The Chief Justice dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.414" offset="413571">Mr. Justice Powell also dissents and joined by Mr. Justice Stewart, has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
