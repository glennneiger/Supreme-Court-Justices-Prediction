            <text syncTime="43.782" offset="278549">This case is here on direct appeal by the Government from a decision of a three-judge District Court in the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.103" offset="311777">In this class action, the court struck down the nine-month duration of marriage requirement for entitlement to mothers and stepchild's benefits imposed by Section 416 (c) and 416 (e) of the Social security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.038" offset="371545">That Act provides benefits for surviving minor children of a wage earner and for the mothers of those children and as the court said this morning, the fathers, so that they need not work outside of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.696" offset="422118">But 416 (e) of the act defines the child of a deceased wage earner to exclude short-term stepchildren, that is ones whose natural parent had married the wage earner in less than nine months before his death and of course the mothers of such ineligible children are not entitled to mother's benefits to permit them to stay home to take care of the ineligible children.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.205" offset="732244">The court below found that the nine-month eligibility requirement was unconstitutional because it thought that it established a conclusive presumption that shorter marriages are undertaken to secure benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.504" offset="1081344">Well, this reflects one of the important factors in the Social Security Act that the -- each specific provision reflects the interrelation and the resultant effect of many different policies that the general policy may -- having this exception because of other policies which are impinge.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.118" offset="1211852">The accident section was added in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.659" offset="1242049">It was a part of -- there were two exceptions put in at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.302" offset="1348629">And Congress may have thought that people who die in accidents earned some sense similar, they too are likely to be young and the Act has always had a particular concern for people, the survivors of wage earners who die before they have a chance to build up financial security for their families when living, families, young families.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.443" offset="1513096">That's -- well, the other basic -- the Congress in these duration of marriage requirements was looking at the problems of the question of motivations for entering into valid marriages.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.003" offset="1619362">They didn't want to pay benefits to those who married simply to get benefits, who were -- thought of marriage is a condition of eligibility for a government subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.188" offset="1668159">But the provision is not a -- kind of a rough evidentiary tool to identify those marriages which were entered into out of a desire to obtain benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.237" offset="1736286">Instead, it is designed to serve as a deterrent or more precisely to make sure that the act doesn't become an incentive to marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.970" offset="1787277">Congress thought that few people would marry for benefits which they couldn't get for many months after marriage and that's why wives of retired workers are not entitled to benefits unless they have been married for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.833" offset="1838686">It's also why widows and their children in appellee's class are not entitled to benefits on the basis of a marriage which ended in death in less than nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.171" offset="1880064">If the duration of marriage requirements were simply evidentiary presumptions the waiting period for wives would make no sense because all wives are entitled after a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.077" offset="1931682">And that's -- so that that provision has no evidentiary purpose in identifying marriage as motivated by a desire for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.201" offset="1968149">The fact that there is this waiting period for wives as well as for widows demonstrates the deterrent purpose of all the duration of marriage requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.342" offset="2012766">There are substantive conditions of eligibility and they're designed primarily to avoid any incentive, the Act might otherwise provide for marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.484" offset="2053308">The fact that as Mr. Justice Blackmun mentioned, there is a group of survivors that Congress has excused from these duration of marriage requirements doesn't indicate any general exception to the provisions of the act requiring duration of marriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.416" offset="3025063">The function of this provision in this Act is to deter the entering into marriages in order to obtain benefits and I believe it's the deterrent purpose of the statute that distinguishes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.086" offset="3127672">The Congress has usually moved step by step in revising the Social Security Act and extending the benefits to particular classes and particular problems are identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.783" offset="3174484">One of the things Congress considers in deciding whether to extend the benefit is the effect on the fund created by Social Secure -- the social security fund which is created from the taxes and of which the benefits are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.180" offset="3232057">Social Security System is supposed to be basically an insurance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.068" offset="3251597">So the actuarial soundness of the fund is a matter of great concern to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.115" offset="3275839">And if it -- a decision of the fund can afford the obligation to pay benefits to survivors of accident victims, doesn't mean that it can also afford payment to survivors of other short-term marriages or than it -- that it could afford to eliminate the duration of marriage requirement altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.066" offset="3343653">The sufficiency of the fund is basic to the effectiveness of the insurance system.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.504" offset="3365386">And so in this area it is particularly important to permit Congress to move step by step in expanding the obligation chargeable against the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.672" offset="3402062">So long as there is a rational basis for distinguishing the categories that Congress defines, this Court should not interfere particularly when as here there is no classification involved which requires any kind of higher than normal judicial scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.634" offset="9929958">Some of them will not be entitled to benefits for a large number of reasons, including the fact that they're not as Mrs. Salfi is, 50 years of age and disabled or that they're not less than 60 years of age or they may be entitled -- Mrs. Salfi for instance because she is on disability gets a certain amount of Social Security benefits anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.527" offset="10029432">So her entitlement is not to a full survivorship benefit, but to a survivorship benefit discounted by the amount of her Social Security disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.324" offset="11752678">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.295" offset="11768560">The 60-day statute of limitation is tied very strictly to the exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.577" offset="11793638">That's what it grows out of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.699" offset="11802206">If the exhaustion requirement is inapplicable, the 60-day statute of limitations is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.466" offset="11825194">The application of that 60-day statute of limitations works a very substantial injustice to our class as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.554" offset="11853615">This class members are ordinary citizens who rely upon SSA for eligibility information, information which is its duty to provide to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.408" offset="11889037">When these people, the vast majority of whom are not constitutional lawyers are told that they're flatly ineligible because of this statue, they're not going to rush off and file a suit in United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.758" offset="11938356">They just assume in justifiable reliance upon the information they've given that they're ineligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.083" offset="11959672">Having been misled by SSA, misled in good faith, but misled nonetheless, the statute of limitation should be considered tolled until 60 days after these people have now been notified of their entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.848" offset="12018813">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.769" offset="12058415">The stipulation in the District Court was to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.575" offset="12081716">It was not to the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.310" offset="12092583">We contested the jurisdiction in the District Court as we did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.748" offset="12118392">The regulation which my opponent refers to concerning retroactive benefits -- retroactive payments went back for -- four years after benefits are denied is designed to recognize that in individual cases in which errors and adjudications are noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.555" offset="12205641">The administration can go back and correct those errors on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.344" offset="12228733">That doesn't open up the possibility of a whole scale reconsideration, that would be the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.597" offset="12277739">The other point is that if it were jurisdiction under 1331 which as we pointed out in our brief, we don't believe there is, the members of the class by my opponent's arithmetic would be entitled to an average of $1750.00, couldn't meet the $10,000.00 jurisdictional amount.</text>
