            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">In Huffman against Pursue, 73-296, we have a case that comes to us from a three-judge district court in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.034" offset="40124">Appellee is a movie exhibitor whose theater was ordered closed by a state court under the Ohio civil nuisance statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.313" offset="73247">Rather than appeal the state court judgment in the Ohio appellate system, the appellee immediately filed this civil rights action or Section 1983 in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.551" offset="118178">And the three-judge district court concluded that an Ohio nuisance statute was a prior restraint on First Amendment activities and enjoined execution of the state court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.484" offset="165930">On this appeal we dont reach the merits of the First Amendment issues because we have concluded that the District Court should not have asserted jurisdiction over this case absent a showing of the extraordinary circumstances recognized in Younger against Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.342" offset="229355">For reasons set out at length in our opinion, we conclude that the notions of committee comity and federalism which underlie Younger are applicable when a federal court is asked to interfere with a state civil proceeding to which the state is a party and which is in aid of its criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.266" offset="297064">We also conclude that these same considerations require that a state litigant exhaust his state appellate remedies before being relieved of Youngers restrictions on interference with state proceedings which have already been initiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.910" offset="351608">We therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.059" offset="372193">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Marshall joined.</text>
