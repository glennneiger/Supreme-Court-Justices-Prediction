            <text syncTime="651.653" offset="2710026">It said depreciation and any of the assets is evidence to be considered in determining the issue of fact whether the accumulation of profits was an excess of the reasonable needs of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.827" offset="2758719">And it's near as I know that quoted statement has never been questioned or repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.542" offset="2781497">And if you do look at depreciation in the assets then it seems to us that the economic test applies when assets are going down that you're certainly justified in looking at it when they go up.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.159" offset="2843982">The stipulation as we mentioned shows that this Xerox stock had a cost of $1,200.00 for the fiscal year 66 and it had a fair market values the party stipulated of almost $2.5 million so that that's 20 or 25 times the original cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.364" offset="2920782">The margin here is such that this corporation could certainly have paid the dividend of $344,000.00 that year without any substantial loss of economic muscles as we view the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.453" offset="3577187">If I could touch as briefly on this question of this securities exchange commission situation, it seems to us that any financial statements that might be submitted to the Security and Exchange Commission or for accounting purposes are usually designed to reflect a financial condition for a fixed period.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.994" offset="3651375">They do not usually look at external sources for supplemental information such as evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.255" offset="3680423">And the question here is whether the corporation is in a position to distribute these current earnings as dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.464" offset="3713233">If the corporation contends that it has business needs then as we've mentioned we look at the available resources and this requires a measuring of assets during the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.648" offset="3757955">Their actual cost some years earlier is really we see -- we believe irrelevant to this economic examination of the period in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.397" offset="3796929">And I think the correctness of this position is demonstrated by the fact that you use value if it is less than cost in determining total resources as this Court has done in the National Grocery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.141" offset="3847920">If the cost were in fact the test you might find a situation where the tax payer had assets on its books considerably higher than their existing value at the time and they really didn't have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.264" offset="3908420">In summary, it seems to us that the statute requires a consideration of economic needs of the business if the corporation has net liquid assets substantial and excess of economic needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.385" offset="3960874">It should distribute its earnings or pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.827" offset="3974666">It certainly should not be permitted to avoid the tax by simply investing funds in readily marketable security.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.531" offset="4005491">We believe that the decision of the Fifth Circuit was correct and should be affirmed.</text>
