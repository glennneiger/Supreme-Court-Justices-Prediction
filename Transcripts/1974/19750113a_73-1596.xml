            <text syncTime="58.330" offset="336645">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.471" offset="349288">We are here on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.559" offset="361618">Respondents are four aliens who have been denied employment in the federal competitive civil service by a reason of the Commissions -- Civil Service Commission's regulation requiring that applicants from most positions be either citizens of United States or persons owing it allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.702" offset="430164">Respondents filed the class action challenging the regulation on constitutional on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.205" offset="452211">The District Court on the government's motion dismissed the action for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.766" offset="474467">The Court of Appeals reversed holding that the regulation violates the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.556" offset="509576">The Court said that alienage is a suspect to classification so that the compelling governmental interest must be shown they justified treating aliens differently than citizens with respect to federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.047" offset="555551">The Court of Appeals relied we believed mistakenly on the rational of this Court's decisions in Sugarman versus Dougall and Graham against Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.193" offset="596093">Those cases concerned of course state restrictions on the eligibility of the aliens for state employment and state welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.446" offset="633187">It is our contention that the Civil Service Commission's regulation is a valid exercise in the national power and I reached that result in alternative ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.855" offset="670804">My first submission is that the Equal Protection principle has no application to the federal governments dealing with aliens as aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.588" offset="705703">It has application of course to the other capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.314" offset="716675">I wish to be quite clear about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.950" offset="731199">The Equal Protection principle applies to persons who are aliens and it protects them from a variety of inequalities such as inequalities imposed on the grounds of their race or religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.153" offset="783966">But the Equal Protection principle does not apply we think to a pure alienage classification such as that before us.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="177.247" offset="812387">Is the Equal Protection principle of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, in other words, when is the federal government that's making the classification?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="185.875" stopTime="216.168">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="185.875" offset="846869">That is entirely correct Mr. Justice Stewart when it is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.264" offset="856377">Everything I am talking about now is in the federal context and I am at some pains to point out what apparently has not been fully understood by respondents that we are not saying that the Equal Protection principle does not apply against the federal government to a person who is an alien and of course it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.406" offset="932968">We're only saying it does not apply to in his capacity as alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.111" offset="951777">It may apply to his capacity whether it's race or religion or sex --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="216.168" offset="968077">Or age?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="216.829" stopTime="438.185">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="216.829" offset="970689">-- or age or some any other way in which the Equal Protection principle applies and of course other constitutional protection supply to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.931" offset="999111">So, we're not contending any such to make any broad claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.174" offset="1024084">The reason we think that the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment can apply it's because of the plenary powers of the national sovereign with respect to alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.333" offset="1076746">Our Constitution does not forbid alienage classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.265" offset="1104436">On the contrary, the Constitution requires the federal government though not the states to employ alienage classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.464" offset="1137246">Now, my alternative submission will be that at most the Equal Protection Clause principle has a very attenuated application to distinctions between citizens and aliens when those distinctions are made by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.233" offset="1204328">To employ the compelling governmental interest standard as the Court of Appeals did is I think effectively to destroy the distinction between citizens and aliens contained in the Constitution or much of it and certainly to destroy much of the great mass of legislation which distinguishes between citizens and aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.504" offset="1277367">Some indication of that massive legislation is contained in the appendix to the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.694" offset="1306102">For the federal government, alienage cannot be a suspect classification because the Constitution gives the federal government the power and indeed the duty to make that classification and to legislate with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.899" offset="1358973">And that's a power to duty of course the states do not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.066" offset="1379662">This necessarily means, I think that if the Equal Protection principle has any application here and I think it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.134" offset="1403904">It is satisfied by meeting the rational basis test and I will argue later that the challenge regulation here clearly meets the rational basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.612" offset="1445804">But first I want to argue that we ought not to apply the Equal Protection test at all in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.681" offset="1470046">We have here an exercise by the Civil Service Commission of the delegated combined powers of the Congress and the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.855" offset="1502751">And those powers of course relate to a naturalization foreign policy national defense, treaty making and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.996" offset="1527306">And in fact, what has been exercised here it seems to me a power inherent in the idea of the sovereignty of a nation state, the power to distinguish between those who owe it allegiance and those who do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.205" offset="1584149">And so obviously is this power to differentiate between those who owe allegiance and those who do not an attribute of sovereignty that the practice and question here is followed by every nation in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.831" offset="1634722">And so obviously as this is an attribute of sovereignty that it is been exercised and gone on contested for more than 90 years which fact I think give to this regulation all the support.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.607" offset="1693759">The long continued and universally accepted usage can confer.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.562" offset="1713612">This factor seemed to me to make this case completely different from Sugarman versus Dougall and Graham against Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.713" offset="1742242">The states are not independent sovereigns; they have no power to regulate naturalization, no power to conduct foreign of affairs, and decide what's required by national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.939" offset="1779127">No power to make treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.236" offset="1788322">Nothing in the Constitution gives them a right explicitly granted to the federal government of treating alienage as a proper classification for legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.079" offset="1827715">If alienage is a suspect classification for state law, it is constitutionally made a proper and indeed inevitable classification for federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.701" offset="2786200">That's entirely correct Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.556" offset="2793618">And I'm fully aware of course that the power of Congress is at its strongest when it's choosing to exclude or class of immigrants or to deport.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.248" offset="2832384">But I think that decision to admit or exclude is necessarily intertwined with decisions about alien's rights and obligations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.435" offset="2861119">For one thing, this case could be recast if Congress so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.498" offset="2881390">I would suppose to say that a condition of entry in the United States is not apply for federal employment until you have been naturalized and if we would then have the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.732" offset="2926320">In fact, I'm not sure that for that reason this regulation doesn't have all the force that law would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.173" offset="2964041">For another thing, decisions about how many to admit under what terms and so forth and the standard for naturalization are necessarily influenced by Congress ability to control the package of rights and obligations that the alien has while here.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.082" offset="3031751">And again, we see that in the Constitution itself indeed in the Fourteenth Amendment which gives birth to the Equal Protection principle in our constitutional jurisprudence, there is a distinction between aliens and citizens which is a distinction made as to aliens and citizens in this country not for purposes of immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.719" offset="3102281">And I will leave the discussion of that distinction to our brief and merely point out that Congress has adjusted this package of rights and obligations that aliens and citizens have again and again throughout our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.130" offset="3151914">And I think that now to begin to apply for the first time, the equal protection principle in the way that the respondents asked would severely hamper Congress' power, destroy it in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.121" offset="3203845">And it would be a major constitutional innovation without any warrant in the constitutional text, in its history or indeed in policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.557" offset="3245641">There is for that reason I think only one fully satisfactory formulation of the law with respect to resident aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.920" offset="3275003">And I would say is this and I think I've said it before but I will stress it as I leave the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.455" offset="3297155">The equal protection principle applies to persons who also are aliens but it does not apply to them in their status as alien.”</text>
            <text syncTime="807.050" offset="3331532">In any other status, they occupy the equal protection principle may apply to them which is to say that Congress may not impose burdens upon resident aliens because they're white or black or yellow or because of their religion but it may differentiate between aliens and citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.756" offset="3398405">Congress may not deprive aliens of specific rights guaranteed elsewhere in the Constitution we're not arguing that it may.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.306" offset="3428603">It obviously may not prison an alien without due process, may not subject them to cruel and unusual punishment and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.977" offset="3455248">But the one principle which is manifestly inappropriate when alien -- when the government -- the federal government addresses alienage as a subject is equal protection because inherent the Constitution, inherent the idea of nationhood is a fundamental inequality between citizens and aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.347" offset="3816782">Under the current doctrinal formulation, the equal protection applies with one of two degrees of severity.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.167" offset="3840084">The federal power I've just sketched means I think that the strict scrutiny mode of analysis or the test of compelling governmental interest is plainly inappropriate to this subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.869" offset="4630862">At the first place, it offers an inducement for resident aliens to acquire knowledge of this country, to acquire the language, to proclaim allegiance, and to become citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.453" offset="4673181">And it seems to me that it's quite legitimate for Congress to wish to induce aliens living here to immigrate themselves into our national life and into our political community in this process of becoming citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.999" offset="4723336">That seems to me to be in fact a rather obvious exercise of the power to make rules to respect the naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.962" offset="4751235">Two, it does avoid a rather large and complex of administrative burden that will be entailed by a system in which all federal jobs were classified according to whether or not they entail any aspect of a formulation or execution of policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.658" offset="4893968">And if we come to our rational relation test rather than a compelling governmental interest test which was applied in Sugarman, then I think this reason becomes important.</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.813" offset="4950601">I think it is if I'm correct that utmost, the rational relationship test applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.763" offset="4974425">Because the federal government which has many, many employees means would have to tag I suppose aliens so that they were not by accident or inadvertence moot to sensitive facilities or into post that might properly be reserved for citizens if we had to meet this administrative burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.515" offset="5053419">And I suppose it will be a great deal of litigation about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.410" offset="5265011">Each of them bears a rational relation to the regulation promulgated by the Commission which means I think that the regulation does not offend the equal protection principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.835" offset="5306702">So, I come back at the end to where it began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.728" offset="5322271">The compelling governmental interest test can hardly be used with respect to federal legislation or federal regulation that is where the federal government has so much power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.059" offset="5375561">If the equal protection principle apply I think have satisfied here if it does not apply clearly, the regulation is valid and we believe that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.509" offset="5685373">Well, counsel for the government is suggesting that the Ninth Circuit opinion is carved out a novel constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.294" offset="5712541">His argument concerning the non-applicability of Fifth Amendment Protections to aliens when the classification is an alienage, I would submit it's the most novel of arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.152" offset="5756008">I think it's important to understand that the four respondents in this case were initially seeking jobs that did not involve foreign affairs, did not involve national security, did not involve some of the issues of sovereignty and some of the issues of executive policymaking which was the concern to this Court in Sugarman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1480.634" offset="6025906">I would agree that it would be obviously best not to strike on a statute but the interpretation of the regulation has been to automatically foreclose at the stage of submitting an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.356" offset="6068746">Any none -- any resident alien, I'd like to make one correction of the opening remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.930" offset="6091107">The regulation in question says that you must be a citizen or of permanent allegiance as the government's brief at page 81, note 67 of its brief indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.056" offset="6131545">The Government has interpreted permanent allegiance to only apply to American Samoans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.052" offset="6151607">But possibly Mr. Justice White if the Government was more liberal in interpreting permanent allegiance we could say the regulation it is chosen not to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.037" offset="6719509">Obviously, the time the case was filed, they were not eligible because they have not lived here requisite number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.653" offset="6741974">The Postal Service has now changed its regulation now that it is no longer under the umbrella of the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.434" offset="6765066">It now allows noncitizens to apply on the same basis for almost all positions in the postal service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.666" offset="6790040">I submit that to respond to Mr. Bork's argument that it might be administratively impossible or inconvenient to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.257" offset="6824417">The Postal Service has more than one half million employees and yet has chosen last May to change its regulations to now allow noncitizens to apply for old most jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.934" offset="6867153">As far as the Equal Protection Clause, clearly this Court has recognized that the Bill of Rights although not explicitly containing equal protection statements contains equal protection principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.465" offset="6921279">This Court said in the same day they issued decision in Brown versus Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.745" offset="6938311">It would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the federal government that imposes on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.991" offset="6967359">This Court has continued to make sure that such and unthinkable anomaly does not occur and throughout the last two decades has applied the same type of standards and the same type approaches in regard to federal discrimination that would've apply had the discrimination been practice by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.776" offset="7030471">Last term, Mr. Justice Brennan speaking for this Court said in Johnson versus Robison, “If a classification would be invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is also inconsistent with the due process requirement of the Fifth Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.284" offset="7092537">Mr. Bork however contends that the Equal Protection Clause does not apply because this case involves the federal government classifying aliens on the basis of their alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.025" offset="7135483">Unfortunately, such statement ignores the clear holdings of this Court in the last four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.993" offset="7163382">The classifications based on alienage are inherently suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.489" offset="7181354">Not just sometimes suspect but inherently suspect that “Aliens as a class are prime example of a discreet and insular minority for whom heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.925" offset="7227120">I think it's important to emphasize why this Court reached that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.563" offset="7249586">This Court has described the indicia that are common to all the classes which have been deemed suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.162" offset="7272051">In the Rodriguez case, this Court said that such heightened judicial solicitude was needed because these individuals are “saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful and equal treatment, or relegated to such a position; a political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.637" offset="7349896">Mr. Justice Powell in the Griffiths case delineated some of the historical hostility that has been heaved upon noncitizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.961" offset="7387199">The scorn, they have been treated as constitutional outcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.807" offset="7398588">This Court has recognized that most states today do not allow noncitizens to vote that they've been denied to franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.964" offset="7423248">Likewise, the fact that noncitizens can become citizens if they wish to exercise the option given to them by Congress did not dissuade this case, this Court in other cases in Sugarman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.050" offset="7467551">Two with the four appellees chose not to exercise the right to become a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.425" offset="7489076">Mr. Justice Powell in Griffiths, explicitly stated that Mrs. Griffiths chose not to file a declaration of intent even in Graham versus Richardson, the appellee Richardson have been in this country far long than necessary to become a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.175" offset="7540067">If the fact that she chose not to become a citizen also was have no important to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.470" offset="7561279">What I'm saying is that the classification based on alienage does not change because it's the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.088" offset="7587715">This Court has continued to recognize that when the federal government itself practices discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.579" offset="7609657">It is bound by the same standard and the same protections which have been put on the states in some more discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.538" offset="7641527">In the Griffiths case, Mr. Justice Powell said that the interests has been characterized but the government must show in many ways overriding, compelling, important, substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.595" offset="7677785">I'm not worried about pigeonhole in this case, in any of those words as the Court said we attribute no particular significance to these variations in diction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.969" offset="7711222">What is important is when such discrimination exists; the Government has a duty to show something more than just some rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.996" offset="7747375">Although, as we contend even under that more differential standard as the Ninth Circuit find in this case, the Government has not satisfied its duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.999" offset="7779349">I just like to make one remark in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.239" offset="7788335">The test is whether or not the Government has employed means which rationally relate to some governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.647" offset="7818010">There's only one purpose in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.919" offset="7826996">The purpose is to best promote the efficiency of the Civil Service, that's a direct quote from 5 U.S.C. 3301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.383" offset="7852910">The purpose of the Civil Service system is to overcome the spoils which historically unfortunate attached the government employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.447" offset="7881122">The purpose of a Civil Service system is not to hire citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.903" offset="7895019">This Court has long discarded the old notion of a special public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.026" offset="7911528">The purpose is to have an efficient government and there is nothing about being a noncitizen, about being a resident alien which means that a person will not be efficient, will not be a competent employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.024" offset="7955519">Unfortunately, my clients and other resident aliens throughout the country are not even given the right to apply, are not even given the right to go through the normal investigative screening process which show whether individual is efficient for the job, to show whether the individual may be loyal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.200" offset="8020198">I do not deny that sometimes the person because of his noncitizen status may not be loyal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.932" offset="8039111">This Government spends millions of dollars each year and employs tens of thousands of people to check on the loyalty of citizens for certain position.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.863" offset="12734777">I would say that, but I'm trying to say that at this point Congress the vehicle that Congress chose and has chosen now a blanket regulation that only deals with resident aliens is not a proper vehicle under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.023" offset="12783470">In Graham, this Court said, “The Congress does not have the power to authorize the individual states to violate the Equal Protection Clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.078" offset="12815653">What I'm suggesting in this case is that Congress doesn't have the power to authorize itself to violate the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.275" offset="12864449">The Congress has violated the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.194" offset="12876152">Should Congress choose other vehicles and I hope that Congress would take the lead that Mr. Justice Blackmun suggested in Sugarman that possibly identified those types of positions were maybe we wished to have citizen formulation and execution review that brought public policy that Congress take the lead of a postal service where the postal service has identified its certain sensitive positions still must be held only by citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.554" offset="12977612">But that for the broad mass of people such as the jobs that my clients are seeking, unfortunately not seeking a job sought by in Mr. Van Braun that citizenship is clearly not relevant for that.</text>
