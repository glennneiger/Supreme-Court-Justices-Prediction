            <text syncTime="54.539" offset="321494">The question in these cases which were consolidated for oral argument is whether the principles Almeida-Sanchez should be applied to invalidate a warrantless search of a vehicle for the presence of concealed aliens when conducted at a boarder patrol checkpoint rather than by officers on a roving patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.993" offset="399339">Each case also presents a retroactivity issue that need be reached by the Court only if it disagrees with our contentions with respect to the principal issue and on that issue, our contention is that checkpoint searches in the Mexican boarder area may properly be conducted without a warrant and without particular knowledge about any specific vehicle that is to be searched.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.848" offset="550745">It is also the basis on which these cases are distinguishable from the next, which raises an issue on the merits slightly different variety variant of Almeida-Sanchez in which a roving patrol officer stopped but did not search an automobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.413" offset="693060">I believe it was and I believe it was adopted so shortly after the statute after the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.628" offset="721899">The search in the Bowen case was conducted two and a half years prior to this court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez at a checkpoint on California State Highway 86, about 36 miles north of the Mexican boarder and a picture of that checkpoint appears on page 2 (a) of our reply brief in Ortiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.767" offset="810402">It was 10 o'clock in the evening on a week night and traffic was light when Bowen approached the checkpoint in a camper truck, the officers stopped him and asked for a citizenship and then as a routine matter they asked him to open the rear of the camper to permit them to check for the presence of concealed aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.517" offset="889396">As soon as Bowen did saw Agent Ortmier smelled marijuana coming from the camper.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.776" offset="910503">He thereupon entered the camper with a flashlight and saw in the forward part of the camper on a mattress what appeared to be in his words either a bedroll or a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.352" offset="956792">When he investigated he found that the objects were actually two backpacks, and as he approached the mattress, he saw stack underneath the mattress kilo bricks of marijuana in cellophane wrapped packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.242" offset="1020322">After Bowen was arrested and the full search of the camper was conducted, the officers found 356 pounds of marijuana in the camper and 158 bends of dream tablets in a jacket on the front seat of the camper.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.148" offset="1079986">Bowen was prosecuted and convicted for the drug offenses based upon the evidence seized from the camper.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.710" offset="1110183">And the Ninth Circuit initially affirmed the conviction stating simply that the search and seizure were plainly lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.517" offset="1141426">This Court thereafter remanded the case for further consideration in light of Almeida-Sanchez and the Court of Appeals again affirmed in a two part embank opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.860" offset="1178833">In part one the court splitting seven to six ruled that the search of a vehicle for aliens at a checkpoint may not be conducted in the absence of probable cause or warrant unless the checkpoint is at the functional equivalent of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.074" offset="1235675">It also held that the checkpoint in this case was not at the functional equivalent of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.667" offset="1254066">In part two of the opinion however, the court held that the ruling part in one should not be applied to exclude the evidence seized from Bowen's camper because the search took place prior to this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez at a time when the settled law, the Ninth Circuit was the such checkpoints searches were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.965" offset="1335254">The search in Ortiz took place after this Court's decision in Almeida-Sanchez, but before the Ninth Circuit's decision in Bowen.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.075" offset="1363675">It occurred at the Border Patrol checkpoint on Interstate Route 5, near San Clemente, California, about 62 miles north of the Mexican border and the picture of that checkpoint appears on the prior page in the appendix to the reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="980.523" offset="4025448">Mr. Justice White, our principal contention in this case is that there are significant differences between roving patrols and checkpoints in terms not only of the Governmental need, not only the nature of the intrusion or the nature of the circumstances in which intrusion occurs, but also in terms of the amenability of the operation to a meaningful warrant procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.873" offset="4138820">And these differences in our view make it possible for the Court to do here what it was unwilling to do in Almeida-Sanchez and that is consistently with the Fourth Amendment to give a fact to the congressional judgment reflected in section 287 (a) 3 of the immigration nationality act that searches vehicles for aliens within a reasonable distance of the border may reasonably be conducted without warrants and without specific backs casting suspicion on a particular vehicle to be searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.285" offset="4256475">I would like to start by discussing the Governmental need involved in these operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.286" offset="4288554">In some respects, the public interest is quite an analogous, similar, identical for that matter to that involved in the circumstances that were before this Court in Almeida-Sanchez except perhaps that the problem has intensified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.689" offset="4338082">At the time of the Baca hearing, which is the district -- consolidated District Court proceeding of which the Ortiz case was a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.095" offset="4371728">It was estimated that there were about 1 million aliens present in this country illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.564" offset="4397641">Current estimates placed the figure much higher, ranging from 5 million to 12 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.186" offset="4424077">Out of the portable aliens who are apprehended in this country, some 90% are Mexican nationals and about 98% of those who have entered clandestinely without inspection are Mexican nationals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.711" offset="4518222">Well, the figures are not broken down in that detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.662" offset="4537971">The record shows in the fiscal year 1973 more than 55 thousand illegal entrants were apprehended in Border Patrol traffic checking operations which in that period would have included to a certain extent a roving patrol operations but that was always a far less significant proportion of the apprehensions that is roving patrols were accounted for far less -- far fewer apprehensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.051" offset="4651551">So you can think in terms I think roughly of 50 thousand out of the -- it was about 13% as I recall from the record of the total number of deportable aliens apprehended by the Border Patrol for the whole year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.239" offset="4716335">The social cost of that is associated with the presence of these many millions of illegal entrance is also enormous and it too is intensified particularly in this present period of high employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.079" offset="4763669">The District Court related one estimate that is long ago is 1971 when nearly 600 thousand Californians were unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.574" offset="4793657">Between 200 thousand and 300 thousand illegal immigrants were employed in that state earning $100 million of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.996" offset="4827408">And the group of American citizens and lawful resident aliens who were the hardest hit by the presence of illegal entrance are the group of unskilled or slightly skilled workers who in any event find it difficult to find employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.964" offset="4875264">The court also found that illegal immigrants pose a potential health hazard because of a high incidence of communicable disease, which is not treated because these persons have not presented themselves for inspection at the border and in some states, the District Court know that the public assistance resources of the communities are devoted in large part to illegal immigrants and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.108" offset="4963767">We think that the public interest in the effect of enforcement of the immigration laws is obvious the traffic checkpoint system plays a substantially greater role in the Border Patrols enforcement scheme than to roving patrols.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.281" offset="5032521">Roving patrols are themselves important as we argued in Almeida-Sanchez and as Mr. Feit will tell you shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.605" offset="5061778">But they have always been essentially supplementary to the checkpoints themselves, which are the heart of the enforcement effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.749" offset="5090408">The record shows that most of the inland movement of illegal aliens is on the major highways leading north from the border and it is there that the checkpoints are placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.122" offset="5131891">Apart from the line watch which is the patrol of the physical boundary, the checkpoints are the principal deterrent to illegal entry and the record demonstrates what the concurring and dissenting opinions recognize in Almeida-Sanchez that the line watch itself is simply incapable of controlling the unauthorized entries across our 2,000 miles of border.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.458" offset="6521187">Yes, it is combination of that and as I indicated the urban congestion in the immediate border areas particularly in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.981" offset="6567267">But that is correct, in order to control not only those who come across lawfully with visitors cards to control their unlawful exceeding of the 25 mile limit, which is a very successful effort because very few people do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.960" offset="6639261">It is also designed to prevent the use of forged or elicit visitors cads, which are used very widely by smuggling operations in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.838" offset="6686699">And one of the reasons why a checkpoint within 25 miles could accomplish nothing in this respect at least that everybody would flash a look alike card when the officer would have no real way beyond, you know, apart from a very intensive investigation to determine whether it was really legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.821" offset="6762663">As under that extent Mr. Justice White, I suppose does relief some of the pressure because there are a number of people who do enter with visitors cards to which they are not entitled but which are look-a-likes, and to that extent, they are intercepted if they carry them with them, which they ordinarily do not, they ordinarily mail them back to Mexico for further use.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.093" offset="6959731">There is some dispute between the litigants here as to whether they are or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.580" offset="6985644">The record in the consolidated District Court proceeding just does not speak to the question at least not clearly the District Court findings were that at the most to the motorist is subjected to is a fleeting stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.422" offset="7041024">We are informed by the Border Patrol hear that with the exception of those vehicles that are referred to secondary, very few come to a full stop except when traffic is light and they are curious, they make -- I mean the sign does say stop and they may stop, but the officer wants to keep the traffic moving and he motions with one hand and then other and generally waives them through four to five miles per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.426" offset="7137050">We may be disputed on that point by the other side, but I have no way of answering it other than what I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.614" offset="7173831">I referred to some of the smuggling that goes on with respect to the transportation of illegal entrance, the record shows that those smuggling operations have been designed specifically to evade the checkpoints and that an alien who pays 200 to $300.00 for transportation to an inland job market is paying for a safe through a checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.364" offset="7272782">One witness stated that without the checkpoints the smugglers would be out of business immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.386" offset="7296920">Indeed the mere cost of -- that a smuggler charge -- the mere price is smuggler charges is a very significant deterrent to many of the persons who otherwise would be tempted to come to this country as Judge Turrentine found the average per capital income of the poorest 40% of Mexican nationals is in the range of a $150.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.995" offset="7395349">There is another difference between checkpoints and roving patrols that we think is significant and this the circumstances in which the intrusion occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.541" offset="7429517">In both cases of course a vehicle -- search of a vehicle is limited to those places in which an alien or a person could reasonably be concealed and that usually means the trunk, sometimes they look in the hood for the reason that this pictures demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.448" offset="7489181">Sometimes they look under the car with a mirror and occasionally they will have to do what they did in the case of Almeida-Sanchez which is to look under the back seat particularly if there is something about the trunk that makes them think there is compartment there or if the driver does not have a key to the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.252" offset="7568384">Unlike a roving patrol however, in which an officer patrols a large area, stopping vehicles by pursuing with a siren and a flashing light often at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.384" offset="7612897">Checkpoints are stationed there and their procedure is more regularized and the Fifth Circuit in the decision that I mentioned earlier stated in upholding a warrantless non-probable cause search of a vehicle for aliens at a permanent checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.607" offset="7685831">A permanent checkpoint the court said does not have the constitutionally frightening aspect of a roving patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.254" offset="7712371">Similarly, there is less flexibility in the operation of a checkpoint and less discretion is vested in the officer himself who is limited to a single location which has been established by senior officials of the Border Patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.177" offset="7760123">That decision I think is subject to important self limiting constraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.210" offset="7780185">There is a very severe shortage of manpower, the officials who are responsible for locating these checkpoints are highly motivated to place them in those spots in which they can operate most effective --</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.472" offset="8321233">I was saying that the decision to locate a checkpoint is not one that is -- the decision of a cop on the bit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.752" offset="8394376">The court stated that permanent checkpoints, the commitment of time, money, personnel and the administrative decision for location of the search are all presumably such as to remove to a large extent the individual arbitrariness that might be available to roving agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.264" offset="8452472">And we believe that the combination of these three factors that greatly increase need for checkpoints are less frightening aspect of the intrusion contemplated in the reduce discretion of the officers at least with respect to the place of the search themselves distinguish checkpoints searches from roving patrol searches and should make it possible for the court to honor the congressional judgment that warrantless searches at vehicles for aliens if conducted within a reasonable distance of the border are necessary for the protection of our border against unauthorized entries and are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.905" offset="12114944">Now, in the Sierra Blanca checkpoint, we had two checkpoints pardon me, two ports of entry on the Texas, Mexico border which were closed down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3092.197" offset="12472195">I don't think for instance in this case, we're talking about checkpoint 66 miles north of the port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.165" offset="12499989">This checkpoint in San Clemente, it's 66 miles north of the San Isidro port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.930" offset="12519111">And I'd really take issue with the Government's contention that they don't want to disrupt commuted traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.907" offset="12538964">That's exactly what's involved at the San Clemente checkpoint where some 10 million cars traverse north from San Diego to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.816" offset="12566653">And a very few as we say a trickle of traffic emanates from the border and goes through San Clemente.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.832" offset="12586715">And we must also look to the fact that 99.9% of the vehicles according to statistical sample taken from Border Patrol affidavits, 99.9% of the vehicles contain no immigration or violators at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.456" offset="12641155">So, I think these are relative criteria in assessing the reasonableness of the checkpoint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.737" offset="12662366">I would also and getting back to the distinction between a roving and a fixed checkpoint we've got to look one, there is unfettered distinction exercise by officer at the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.860" offset="12698833">Now, there's a discrepancy at to whether stuff takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.391" offset="12708968">I would simply rely on the pictures submitted by the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.952" offset="12731225">It says ”All traffic stop here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.080" offset="12739688">There's a Border Patrol men with a stop sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.033" offset="12747525">A mile down the road Interviewer it says, “All traffic prepare to stop.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.579" offset="12761736">And then the Government's opening brief that makes illusion back at hearings where the court specifically laid out all of the procedures to notify the oncoming traffic that they're going to be stopped to hit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.157" offset="12811995">Now, for those individuals who are lucky enough to pass the unfettered discretion of the point officer and make it through, that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.391" offset="12848985">But then there's a significant amount of traffic that is referred based on no particular basis except as the Government says, “The ESP powers are the sixth sense power of the point officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.704" offset="12902170">In the exercise of his sixth sense, he refer to some cars over to the secondary for a full search of the trunk, the hood area, and under the front seat.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.606" offset="12945847">I might add that this is conducted by armed officers in uniform who as the consolidated hearings may have claimed or not the administrative officers, law enforcement officers carrying 357 magnums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.091" offset="12999764">And when a car is referred to the secondary area, one officer approaches the passenger's side, one officer approaches the driver's side, orders the individual out, orders him to open his trunk, orders him to open the hood and then the inspection of the interior may take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.936" offset="13055143">So, this is hardly a situation where the protections for the Fourth Amendment should be abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.456" offset="13081161">And as this Court said in Calandra “The need for deterrence and hence the rationale for excluding evidence are strongest for the Government's unlawful conduct would result in imposition of a criminal sanction on the victim of the search.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.878" offset="13130898">And that's what exactly is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.910" offset="13139048">The victim of the search in this case was Mr. Ortiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.800" offset="13150542">A search took place and which it was unlawful after Almeida-Sanchez made it clear that probable cause was required in search not at the functional enclavement of the border and not authorized by warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.527" offset="13197458">Nevertheless, the search took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.292" offset="13204564">The evidence was discovered which led to the conviction of Mr. Ortiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.197" offset="13224208">With respect to the issue of the card holders, initially Mr. Evans said, “Well, they're not the problem.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.791" offset="13246568">But in addressing Justice Powell he said, “Well, they are the problem.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.942" offset="13259107">That is one of the criteria for the establishment of the checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.739" offset="13274363">Our brief makes quite clear that the INS was represented to a Congress of the United States that you can't equate the problems of the I-186 card holders with the surreptitious entrance, because the I-186 card holders treasure the card that gives them the right to enter the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.629" offset="13337893">They enter at a port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.054" offset="13343640">They do not use smugglers because they can enter legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.523" offset="13357432">And further INS statistics also reveal that all checkpoint operations in fiscal 1973 accounted 4.003% of the people who had I-186 cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.837" offset="13410722">It simply not a problem at the checkpoints, of the over half million illegal aliens captured 1973 I think something less than 5,000 were I-186 card holders abusing their privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.369" offset="13460877">They are not the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.841" offset="13466728">And the Government has two problems with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.875" offset="13478849">Checkpoints were not established to control I-186 card holders because as the decision of the Tenth Circuit in Rhoa Rodriguez makes clear I-186 card holders up until just a few years ago could travel up to 150 miles north of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.594" offset="13533706">So, therefore checkpoint up until very recently when that restriction was brought on the 25 miles but checkpoint was orderly useless in monitoring that type of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.140" offset="13579891">Further, the Government has a bootstrap argument with booth I-186 card holders because it's the Government that's issuing those cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.859" offset="13610820">And if it would be rather ironic reason to allow the Government to conduct this massive road blocks based on the issuance of cards which usually have a perfect right either not to issue at all or to issue in a more restrictive manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.076" offset="13671633">So, I don't think the I-186 card rationale plus it all on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.547" offset="13697546">And I might also add when we're talking about the distinction between a roving and a fixed checkpoint that the Bowen court of course found a significant degree of the discretion with the point officer in selecting whom he would select for this more intrusive type of search and it certainly not a modest intrusion for an individual to be travelling 155 miles an hour in interstate freeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.406" offset="13788975">Perhaps, never having even come close o the border and then to be ordered of the freeway by an armed officer in this intrusive sort of search conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.344" offset="13828786">In this case, there is no evidence that Mr. Ortiz ever went closer than 15 miles north of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.469" offset="13853236">The only evidence in the stipulated facts trial is that Mr. Ortiz picked up three aliens in Oceanside of California whom he knew to have entered within three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.500" offset="13889390">That is the only time in place nexus which connects the search to the border unlike the Almeida-Sanchez case where the officers at the time they conducted a search knew that Almeida-Sanchez had just come from the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.122" offset="13939858">And this is sort of typical of the blanket drag net type of search and seizure policy that goes on at the checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.668" offset="13970056">Another problem I have with the Government's information relying on the INS provided maps is in the first map, I'm sort of glad the Court doesn't have the map because it's really inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.184" offset="14020106">The Government said that there are 12 checkpoints in the southern district of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.497" offset="14041318">The testimony by the two agents who run all the checkpoints in the southern district of California indicated that there were nine such checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.965" offset="14067231">The Government has indicated in the maps to this Court that three agricultural stations located on the Arizona-California border are immigration checkpoints established by the INS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.434" offset="14109132">Another one when located in the Tecate, California and number four simply does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.966" offset="14135254">And so that's unfortunate that took place but the record clearly reflects that there are nine and where they are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.888" offset="14162944">And if I might further add that if this Court sees fit to apply the probable cause standard to the search that took place in this case as it should since it is directly -- the analogy is clear to Almeida-Sanchez and Carroll versus United States that not all checkpoints were immediately going to collapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.974" offset="14239222">This checkpoint is simply unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.848" offset="14254791">It doesn't come close to meeting the requirements of a functional equivalent, 99.9% of the traffic according to INS statistics contains no immigration law violators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.207" offset="14304214">96% of those searched at this checkpoint are not violating any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.746" offset="14322395">It's really a massive intrusion and sort of a blanket scale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3636.828" offset="14650702">And I would submit that the fifth circuit has already found two of the checkpoints on the maps submitted to the Court to be the functional equivalent of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.469" offset="14681213">And so, it's really a non-wanted inference to believe that declaring the unreasonable checkpoint at San Clemente illegal that that would have a domino effect on other checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.566" offset="14725622">We're only dealing with the San Clemente checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.598" offset="14737742">Now, the Government's theory which it brings to this Court for the first time I might add since I didn't bring before the District Court or before the Court of Appeals is that there's a functional equivalent of probable cause in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.692" offset="14786121">Now Justice Powell is the only member of this Court to have spoken to the relatively unstructured concepts of the functional improvement of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.853" offset="14822797">But I might just go over the five criteria that Justice Powell talked to and demonstrate other court—I mean how the Government has not addressed any of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.203" offset="14856234">Number one, there was warrant requirement because this is the concept where certainly a judicial officer should make the determination and not a Border Patrol men standing 66 miles north of a border determining a legal concept such as the functional equivalent of probable cause.Second, the distance from the border, 66 miles in this case and the geographic characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.080" offset="14943692">The geographic characteristics in this area, we have an interstate freeway where the commuted traffic between San Diego and Los Angeles is interrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.346" offset="14984756">This is not the -- I do not believe this is what Justice Powell was talking to in his concurrent opinion because after the mention was made of geographic characteristics or there's a footnote to the problem long the border and that is that there are vast areas, rural, desert areas where there are no points of ports of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.053" offset="15059571">And yet there are means for aliens to surreptitiously enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.162" offset="15075976">This isn't the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.088" offset="15079737">Here we have a checkpoint north of the Second Circuit largest city of California and north of about 18 other cities along the coast and just south of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.314" offset="15116622">So, it has nothing to do really with border enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.408" offset="15128952">And as a matter of fact the only people who would be coming from the border on I-5 many of them of course would have gone through the San Isidro port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.424" offset="15165106">The most important criteria that Justice Powell talked to was the interference with the rights of the innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.069" offset="15183600">And I will not repeat the 99.9% figure again as to of the people who are violating the law when they passed the checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.497" offset="15213380">So, on these criteria, certainly there is no functional equivalent of probable cause and when the Government says, “Oh, we've had a problem getting a warrant for this checkpoint.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.935" offset="15247130">Well, there's no wonder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.765" offset="15250474">They certainly haven't established the functional equivalent of probable cause unless that's to be a really meaningless concept because if that's functional and equivalent, there should be some probability that the people going through that checkpoint are violating the law, that's what probabilities were all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.859" offset="15310764">But in this case, it's less than one-tenth of percentage of the vehicles going through the checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.330" offset="15348694">I've got two minutes before lunch and I'll try to make that time deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.653" offset="15365935">I might address myself to the Camara concept which the Government has also sought to take refuge under.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.177" offset="15396028">In Camara, the intrusion was that of an administrative clerk who went to a home to look for housing code violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.301" offset="15428524">Persons who were found in violation were not prosecuted for felonies as Mr. Ortiz was which carries a maximum penalty of five years per alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.705" offset="15458200">As a matter of fact, as a matter of course they weren't prosecuted at all whereas the Government economic acclaim to this Court that the transporters of aliens were not prosecuted when they found.</text>

            <text syncTime="3991.376" offset="16068838">The Government had its opportunity of the consolidated hearings to provide this information.</text>

            <text syncTime="4004.986" offset="16123277">The question in this case is not whether or not searches for legal aliens can take place at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.444" offset="16145115">It's whether they can take place with probable cause or based upon a warrant, or based upon the functional equivalent of the board -- of probable cause of based upon a checkpoint at the functional equivalent of the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.315" offset="16192658">But then in addition to those alternatives, the Border Patrol has at least eight or nine other programs which they use to capture illegally entering aliens that includes that line watch roving patrols near the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.559" offset="16261622">The form investigations, transportation terminal checking procedures, metropolitan investigations, and I'll stop at Metropolitan investigations because in a 20-day period in the City of Los Angeles, a handful of immigration inspectors swept through evidently a barrio in Los Angeles are and captured 20,000 illegal aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="4081.643" offset="16429955">But in a 20-day working period, the INS was able to capture 20,000 in the City of Los Angeles which sort of detracts from the theory that the Government will be unable to discover illegal aliens once they have crossed the border which is of course the first line where the Border Patrol should be watching with increased vigor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.456" offset="16509158">I might also point to the record which establishes that the entire California and Mexico border during a typical day is guarded by 30 Border Patrol agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.283" offset="16552521">And there are nine inland checkpoints in the southern District of California which takes away obviously a significant amount of manpower from the border.</text>

            <text syncTime="4382.803" offset="17634617">For instance I cited in the brief the statistic that the San Clemente checkpoint captures only 5% of the illegal alien traffic going through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.553" offset="17669622">With that efficiency ratio, it's hardly a deterrent to illegal aliens passing through that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="4405.867" offset="17726882">But on page 12 and 13 of the reply brief by the petitioner is the statement concerning the appearance of persons of Mexican residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.816" offset="17778604">The petitioner has asserted that Border Patrol officers using their sixth sense powers of extra sensory perception can determine merely by a quick visual glance at a person coming in a vehicle and an interstate highway whether that person is an illegal alien from Mexico or a lawful permanent resident from Mexico or a Mexican-American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.499" offset="17873377">And they can make that distinction sufficiently clear to cause a referral to its secondary basically only where there's a reasonable suspicion of unlawful alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.574" offset="17921651">If we read the characteristics that the Government asserts on page 12 and 13 describing the illegal Mexican alien I think it would be safe to say as the Ninth Circuit has said and just taken judicial notice that it is impossible based on an appearance of an individual to tell whether he is here illegal or legal or illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.169" offset="18008064">And in fact of course the imperial county is 52% Mexican-American in the southern district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.626" offset="18037844">San Diego County which has a population of a million and a half is 13% Mexican-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.297" offset="18056547">Los Angeles has the largest Mexican-American population in the northern hemisphere outside of Mexico City.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.601" offset="18081729">Now, these people have a right to uninterrupted travel and not to be referred to secondary because some Border Patrol men thinks they may be illegal aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="4542.020" offset="18271483">And certainly is not a basis for reliance in terms of the clear past precedent of this Court and is not a basis of reliance even under the statutory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="4631.853" offset="18630823">This is the enabling statute which allows them to search at the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.916" offset="18647019">1357 merely allows what Justice Stewart found in Almeida-Sanchez a search within reasonable distance from the border which I think common sense would have told the Immigration and Naturalization Service at that time does not mean that the necessity of probable cause is dispensed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.306" offset="18720580">Merely, reasonable distance from the border and certainly not some 45 to 50 miles from the border as it was the case in Bowen or some 60 miles as it was the case in Ortiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.062" offset="18767600">So, certainly we do not concede that this statute either on its phase or any reasonable interpretation of it, by lawyers for the Immigration and Naturalization Service trained in the law, who advise these officers to conclude that the probable cause requirement imposed by the Fourth Amendment since the inception of this country could be dispensed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.144" offset="18847953">And I hope that the record is perfectly clear as to that lack of a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.550" offset="18861537">And in fact a reading of the statutes or both statutes would show that 1225 (a) enables them to search at the border, if they believe aliens are coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.222" offset="18916289">And 1357 allows them to search within a reasonable distance from the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.775" offset="18942516">If they have a probable cause, they could search it without a warrant in both cases certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.321" offset="18964668">Every Fourth Amendment case of course turns upon its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.524" offset="18977520">And in this case the facts that Mr. Bowen are those of every citizen in the United States I submit who chooses to travel in the hunting and fishing agriculture area of highway 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.070" offset="19031646">In Almeida-Sanchez if you all remember after he was stopped, Mr. Almeida-Sanchez identified himself as a resident of Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="4758.987" offset="19139271">No one had seen him come to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.128" offset="19147839">He wasn't asked questions whether he was coming to Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="4767.647" offset="19173961">Also in Bowen, is distinguished from Almeida-Sanchez even and even stronger facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.412" offset="19197053">Mr. Bowen was driving a camper which we all know is to some people they're home on wheels especially their vacation home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.780" offset="19230490">The Border Patrol men in Bowen as far as he knew could have discovered Mr. Bowen's wife or his children's sleeping in the back and disturb them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.655" offset="19257971">He could have discovered and guess Mr. Bowen sleeping in the back or doing any of the other private things which we knew are done in Campers including toilet habits or any other private thing you do in your house.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.124" offset="19303842">There is nothing in the nature of Bowen's car, nothing in the nature of his appearance, racial or otherwise and nothing in the nature of his statements to the Border Patrol which would indicate anything other than he was a vacation traveler in this recreation area next to the Salton Sea which is a prime fishing area in the Southern California area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.891" offset="19394957">The nature of this search as shown by the Bowen facts is that arbitrary one giving complete discretion to the Border Patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.782" offset="19430484">As I stated before, there is no showing whatsoever that Bowen's vehicle had ever been to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.532" offset="19449501">Of course a reasonable interpretation of the Border Patrol's power in this case that is functional equivalent of the border would have provided this nexus but they didn't have it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.938" offset="19487117">They had a regulation enacted by the INS itself which said that, “Well, what's reasonable is a hundred miles.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.110" offset="19519822">And I think we can all agree where that 100 miles was picked from.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.428" offset="19533093">It's an arbitrary figure having nothing to do with nexus to the border or functional equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.886" offset="19554931">Common sense would tell us that when Congress enacted the statute in light of the Fourth Amendment and in light of the Caroline cases from this Court and without express authorization that Congress never meant to waive the probable cause requirements of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.902" offset="19618983">And without the statutory justification and without reasonable reliance, certainly this case presents no retroactivity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.293" offset="19652524">It presents no retroactivity question because it doesn't overrule clear past precedent because what is the precedent if it's not the statute as I've already argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.434" offset="19693066">The precedent is merely a self-serving regulation enacted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.341" offset="19720756">But was this a precedent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service?</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.919" offset="19739042">If you will see the record in the Baca hearings, you will see that these checkpoints have been in existence since 1925.</text>

            <text syncTime="5373.695" offset="21598124">Isn't it the Government's point?</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_l_evans" startTime="5375.534" stopTime="5724.907">
            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="5375.534" offset="21605543">No, it's not the Government's point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.729" offset="21610245">Well, the Government's point is because Bowen was the litigant in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.838" offset="21626755">And because the Ninth Circuit decided the Bowen case that that should be the basis for all decisions in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.807" offset="21662595">I submit certainly if that is the judgment of this Court that certainly Bowen should receive the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.151" offset="21687986">But of course if the judgment of this Court that Bowen is decided today nationwide then Bowen should also receive the benefit of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.791" offset="21722572">But what I'm really urging is that Bowen should receive the benefit not of this decision, not only for those two reasons but also for the reason that Bowen is the beneficiary of this Court's first opportunity to review border checkpoint cases in the light of its past decisions under Carol.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.920" offset="21791013">And I think under all three of those focuses of analysis, Bowen gets the benefit of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.233" offset="21824345">Once more in the retroactivity analysis, I think what you're also looking at is reasonable reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.067" offset="21855692">The Ninth Circuit made a big point of the fact that the INS relied upon Ninth Circuit opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.910" offset="21878993">I've already pointed out that from 1925 to 1946 the INS relied on nothing, not statute, not decision, nothing to establish these checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.519" offset="21921416">It's also pointed out at page 74 of the brief and I believe the brief in Ortiz that the INS stopped and searched a citizen one month after the Bowen decision was decided in the Ninth Circuit outlying that very practice without a warrant and without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.769" offset="22022457">That's on page 74 of the Ortiz brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.674" offset="22034056">So, certainly they're not relying on the Ninth Circuit either for the prior justification before the statue or for the subsequent justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.440" offset="22065089">The INS is just stopping and searching people without authority or certainly not relying upon the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.142" offset="22095914">If it could be argued, the INS stopped Sanchez Pedroza which is the case a month after Bowen was decided in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.470" offset="22129246">If it's argued that way, then of course they're waiting for this Court to decide Bowen finally and that would show that they originally should have looked to the carol decision in making their judgments and drafting the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.031" offset="22183476">The point is made in the amicus brief Your Honor that this case should be decided not on a retroactivity analysis for another reason, that this Court should control the applicability of its constitutional decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.530" offset="22237497">And I think that's a very, very important point because what you're deterring here by that kind of analysis is future drafting of regulations in a haphazard manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.577" offset="22297684">What you're encouraging by that kind of analysis is the drafting of regulations carefully and prudently looking at all the law especially including the laws announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.545" offset="22341569">Had that been done by the persons and why not looking at law enforcement just -- you noted reasonable reliance by law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.506" offset="22381380">That's not all you're deterring in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.944" offset="22391097">The only authority for these officers to conduct this search was a regulation drafted by their own people at the INS.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.819" offset="22418683">What you are deterring and would be deterring in the future by a non-retroactivity analysis and deciding whether retroactivity applies on a case-by-case basis is careful, prudent, drafting of regulations which guides this law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.174" offset="22492035">And I think that's a practice you want to encourage and I think a practice you want to deter is haphazard drafting without research or without authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.549" offset="22533517">Even under the traditional retroactivity analysis this case differs from the prior Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.127" offset="22559848">This case will not have nationwide application as all of the other cases where non-retroactivity was ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.328" offset="22592658">This case deals with the INS, the INS only.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.679" offset="22606137">The smallness of that law enforcement agency is well apparent from the Government's briefs and from the petitioner's briefs and all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.849" offset="22642813">Nor will it disrupt state, local and federal courts all over the country or law enforcement authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.034" offset="22679489">Certainly, this analysis would aid in that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.941" offset="22699133">And aids you to see that this in the first instance is not a retroactivity case because at the prior law of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.003" offset="22727346">And second, that even if you consider it under the traditional analysis, the extent of the reliance is much smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.510" offset="22753364">The effect on courts and administration of justice is much smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.885" offset="22770918">And certainly no one can say that this is reasonable reliance by the Immigration and Naturalization Service on clear past practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.246" offset="22804355">Your case is on retroactivity as I see it falling into two categories, number one, where you've overruled cases like Rabinotwitz and Goldman and one of your retroactivity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.449" offset="22849181">But number two, where you've ordered law enforcement officers to do something that they have never been required to do before such as Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.482" offset="22877288">You've got to give warnings now as what you've said in certain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.310" offset="22892648">And neither of those cases -- those two types of cases has anything to do with this situation where as we‘ve already pointed out clear law did not support the regulations issued by the justice department nor did a fair reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.686" offset="22962134">And as I say when you talk about law enforcement in a situation like this, you're talking about not only the officer in the field but those who are advising him.</text>
