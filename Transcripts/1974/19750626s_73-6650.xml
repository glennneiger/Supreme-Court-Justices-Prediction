            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The last case, Brown against Illinois comes to us from the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.161" offset="24555">The petitioner was arrested without probable cause and without a warrant when two Chicago plainclothes detectives broken to his apartment and awaited his return.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.619" offset="78472">They were investigating the murder a few days earlier of a man named Corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.949" offset="99788">Brown was an acquaintance of that decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.172" offset="116611">Brown was taken into custody and removed to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.250" offset="132911">And there he was warned of his rights under Miranda versus Arizona and despite this warning, he gave two inculpatory statements, each of which was reduced to writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.541" offset="178155">He signed one but not the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.225" offset="188813">His pretrial motion to suppress those statements was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.691" offset="206681">We thus have a situation where it is conceded that his arrest was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.084" offset="228310">But where during the custody incident to that arrest he was given proper Miranda warnings and in the face of those warnings, issued statements that implicated him in the crime under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.578" offset="282227">The Illinois courts held that despite the unlawfulness of the arrest, the statements were admissible because the giving of the Miranda warnings broke the causal connection between the illegal arrest and the giving of the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.448" offset="337711">And thus his act in making the statements was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.889" offset="375536">This issue takes us to the Court's decision in Wong Sun against the United States decided here 12 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.871" offset="403435">In an opinion filed today, we hold that the Illinois courts were in error when they adopted a per se rule that the giving of the Miranda warnings in and of themselves broke the causal chain so that the later statement even if it were one induced by the continuing effects of unconstitutional custody was admissible so long as in the traditional sense it was voluntary and not coerced in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.042" offset="512104">We are here concerned however with the Fourth Amendment and its guarantee against unlawful searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.657" offset="538540">The interest and the policies and the -- the Fourth Amendment serves are distinct from those served under the Fifth and thus even though the statements were found to be voluntary under the Fifth Amendment, the issue as to the propriety under the Fourth Amendment still remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.229" offset="608862">We hold that the question whether a confession is voluntary under the guidelines of Wong Sun must be answered on the facts of each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.281" offset="649091">The Miranda warnings are an important factor in resolving the issue but other factors also must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.707" offset="674795">And of the course the burden of showing the admissibility of the in-custody statements of persons illegally arrested rest upon the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.074" offset="712202">We go on to hold that the state in this case failed to sustain its burden of showing that the petitioner's statements were admissible under Wong Sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.883" offset="747520">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.449" offset="781793">Mr. Justice White has filed a statement concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.636" offset="798511">Mr. Justice Powell has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part and Mr. Justice Rehnquist had joined him in that opinion.</text>
