            <text syncTime="46.307" offset="288580">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.768" offset="298402">My name is Vernon Arey and I represent the petitioners in the instant case, Warden Garrell S. Mullaney of the Maine State Prison in the State of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.652" offset="333928">Facts of this case briefly as follows; the trial although the state's case against the respondent in this case whom I shall refer to --throughout my discussion as the defendant, since he appeared in that posture below and I referred to him as such in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.566" offset="397667">The State of Maine alleged that Mr. Wilbur had alleged -- had inflicted such severe injuries upon the victim, Mr. Claude Hebert with his fists and a blunt instrument that Mr. Hebert died shortly after receiving this beating.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.086" offset="467675">The theory of the defense was that though this beating had been inflicted, the actions had been generated by the heat of passion on sudden provocation because of an indecent homosexual overture made by Mr. Hebert.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.668" offset="542072">The jury rejected this contention and convicted the defendant of murder.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="114.279" offset="560462">Well, you can hardly call that a contention in the traditional sense, can you?</text>
            <text syncTime="117.620" offset="573837">Since he didn't take the stand and it's gone into the record sort of backward, didn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="vernon_i_arey" startTime="125.111" stopTime="355.248">
            <label>Mr. Vernon I. Arey</label>
            <text syncTime="125.111" offset="603826">Well, Your Honor I think that depends upon tactics of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.334" offset="616678">Counsel -- excuse me, whether wisely or unwisely apparently made the decision that he did not have to place the defendant on the stand and chose to do it through failure to object to the entrance into evidence of the statements of the defendant as to what happened of that time, and then relied upon his opening argument to point out to the jury how he had felt he admit his burden as it was imposed by the State of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.254" offset="720436">After a complex procedural history, which need not concern us here, the defendant in 1971 appealed this case to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.056" offset="771636">Essentially, he argued at that time and in substance that the presiding justice at his trial had committed error when it charged that once the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt, an intentional and an unlawful killing that malice aforethought would be presumed and that the burden would be on the defendant to mitigate the crime thus proved to manslaughter of the voluntary type.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.019" offset="911444">Unless he, the defendant, established by a preponderance of the evidence that the crime was committed upon heat of passion on sudden adequate provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.672" offset="966092">This has generated essentially one issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.432" offset="981138">And that issue is whether in placing the burden upon the defendant to show even by a preponderance of the evidence, the absence of malice aforethought, the court has denied the defendant on this case due process of law under the rational of In re Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.780" offset="1046444">Maine court rejected any possible Winship violation on two essential grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.204" offset="1064208">First, it recognized that the Maine law establishes as part of its fundamental system a single generic concept of felonious homicide and that once a felonious homicide is proved, criminality is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.007" offset="1135365">But more than that in this case and when I get to the lower felonious homicide, I will again be emphasizing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.851" offset="1158771">The Maine law requires not only the mirror establishment of a felonious homicide with constituent elements to erect a presumption of malice, but a felonious homicide of a particular type and that is a felonious homicide which is either intentional or which is characterized by acts, which when objectively evaluated have a very high depth producing potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.727" offset="1258245">If those approved, the State of Maine establishes as its policy the crime as murder definitionally proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.338" offset="1296697">The process by which we define this is called a presumption of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.972" offset="1319267">The Maine court in Wilbur traced the history of the single generic concept to felonious homicide as it existed in Maine for a hundred years and said, “In viewing Winship, we find that the case of In re Winship is confined to its facts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="319.858" offset="1382797">Which essentially is talking about elements of criminality, when we are making the decision on the first instant, whether it be to brand and a juvenile or the label of delinquent, or a man with the label of criminal that different factors are involved in making a determination as to what due process means given that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.020" offset="1483421">In Maine, we are not doing this in the first instance. We are making a determination as to what the appropriate penalty shall be for a felonious homicide.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="355.248" offset="1524381">Mr. Arey, your statute -- am I correct your statute doesn't speak in so many words of felonious homicide?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="vernon_i_arey" startTime="361.929" stopTime="702.057">
            <label>Mr. Vernon I. Arey</label>
            <text syncTime="361.929" offset="1551130">That is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.582" offset="1557713">And as far as I know the statutes of Maine have never spoken of felonious homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.250" offset="1576417">But tracing through the history of this case, I think it would become clear that this is deemed of no significance by the court and has been acquiesced in by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.229" offset="1624273">The second ground that the Maine law court denied the defendant's appeal on was essentially that the case of Winship even if extended in the view of the Maine court would not be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.410" offset="1665024">And of course it's conceded by all, but that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.793" offset="1674533">The case of In re Winship has been made retroactive by Ivan v. City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.336" offset="1700760">The defendant in this case then petitioned the District Court for its southern division with district of Maine petition writ of habeas corpus, alleging the same material that he has alleged here and we are arguing about before this Court that he argued before the Maine law court.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.553" offset="1765543">Petition was granted with the reference to that one issue, but the opinion and order of the Honorable Justice Gignoux being that there was no such thing in the State of Maine as the crime of felonious homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.962" offset="1811205">That the Maine statutes would not speak of the crime of felonious homicide and that the State of Maine is in effect misapplying its own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.276" offset="1848508">The state timely appealed from that decision of the District Court and went to the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.188" offset="1876093">Pending the state's appeal to the First Circuit court in Boston, the state -- a case State v. Rollins, which is found at 295 A. 2d 914 and is cited in the brief, and is an important in establishing what the concept of felonious homicide is in Maine, was decided by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.706" offset="1954147">It fully reaffirms the principles which were announced by Justice Weber and the original decision in Mr. Wilbur's appeal to that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.867" offset="2002840">The case was briefed and argued before the First Circuit, and the decision of the District Court was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.899" offset="2030947">The State of Maine then petitioned this Honorable Court for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.996" offset="2051323">During the pendency of the writ of certiorari, the case of State v. Lafferty was decided by the Maine law court.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.882" offset="2082879">In State v. Lafferty is found at 309 A. 2d 647, and the case of State v. Lafferty expressly rejected the right of either the First Circuit Court of Appeals or of the Federal District Court to indicate and dictate to the State of Maine what its law was and that the State of Maine was proper in deciding its law and went on further to reaffirm the principle of the concept of felonious homicide as announced in the original Wilbur decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.876" offset="2198862">This Court granted petition for writ of certiorari summarily vacated the First Circuit decision, remanded the case to the First Circuit in Boston for consideration in light of the case of State v. Lafferty.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.748" offset="2250376">Upon reconsideration, we finally were postured with the court -- the position of the case as it is before this Honorable Court today, because on remand, the First Circuit acceded to the fact that the law of Maine recognized the concept of a single generic offense within which the penalty category designations of murder and manslaughter operated not as elements of criminality, but as elements or factors bearing upon the punishment of an individual who has had the determination made beyond a reasonable doubt that he is a criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.162" offset="2408051">However, the court went on despite this fact, the case of In re Winship as it is announced as a matter of policy should apply to this situation because of the potential stigma which an individual faces when he is faced in the difference between life imprisonment and 20 years for manslaughter or the possibility of probation and the possibility of a man's loss of liberty is as great in a situation where you are determining punishment as it is when you are making the decision in the first instance of criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.563" offset="2545664">The state respectfully suggests that that is an unwarranted extension of the case of In re Winship beyond the facts and limitations to which it spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.174" offset="2580041">The state further suggests that in the there are cases in this Court which have indicated and which were relied upon by the State of Maine in the original Wilbur decision that factors bearing upon punishment have been treated differently, and we ask ourselves why.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.849" offset="2642735">And as we go through the concept of felonious homicide, I hope that I can explain that to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.054" offset="2667604">It is critical that this Court understand what the State of Maine is talking about when it talks about the concept of a single generic offense as it is designated in the common law of the State of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.604" offset="2733746">Essentially, the concept is there is one generic offense, an unlawful or a felonious homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.294" offset="2760600">And that this unlawful or felonious homicide consists of degrees and that these degrees consist of murder and manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.670" offset="2802082">Manslaughter being again divided into two degrees, common law manslaughter and voluntary manslaughter, and these degrees are nothing more nor less than punishment categories which society has designated in advance for actions which have certain results attributed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.053" offset="2895600">Now what are the elements of felonious homicide?</text>
            <text syncTime="701.458" offset="2909184">The elements --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="702.057" offset="2911587">Do you have any other crime in Maine, Mr. Arey, where this is also true?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="vernon_i_arey" startTime="709.330" stopTime="876.340">
            <label>Mr. Vernon I. Arey</label>
            <text syncTime="709.330" offset="2940740">The single generic concept Your Honor, yes I believe arguably in the situation of assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.371" offset="2968848">That assault is recognized as the underlying crime and the element of high in aggravation is recognized as only going to punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.358" offset="3000822">High in aggravation is not recognized as being a criminal element.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.746" offset="3014405">Now, the State of Maine does require that the element of high in aggravation be decided by a jury and it also requires that it be decided beyond reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.299" offset="3064560">I am not sure that that decision would come about the same way nor am I sure that the Ferris case, and that's the case I'm referring to, is analogous to this one, and why do I say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.066" offset="3103640">I say that because there is no middle ground in assault by which we're going to put any burden upon the defendant to disprove or prove anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.369" offset="3136867">There is either simple assault which is the criminal act in itself or the element of high in aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.567" offset="3157661">There is no middle ground by which it can drop back into.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.130" offset="3167901">In other words, if in the State of Maine there were only manslaughter and murder, you would have an analogous situation, there'll be no reason for a presumption because there's nothing to mitigate to.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.670" offset="3206040">You're talking about either criminality or non-criminality the minute you drop back to the lower designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.447" offset="3233207">Secondly, I would argue that on the facts of the case as we posture it in felonious homicide punishable as murder, the case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.950" offset="3275212">Because unlike the original common law presumption which required only the showing of an unlawful killing, and which required the defendant to establish factors in excuse and justification as well as in palliation, the main presumption does not arise until the state has proven an intentional and an unlawful killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.725" offset="3358281">And the definition of unlawful is a killing which is not justified nor excused, the state bearing the burden upon the factors of criminality, the defendant bearing the burden only upon the elements of palliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.542" offset="3409586">Now, the elements of felonious homicide in the first instance are that the victim is dead and unless be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.755" offset="3442395">Second that the defendant killed the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.190" offset="3456084">Third, that the killing was voluntary that is that it was an act of his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.340" offset="3476773">And lastly, that the killing is unlawful and that is that it's not justified nor excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.919" offset="3503000">Felonious homicide punishable as murder has precisely the same four elements with one additional, and that is that the killing and addition to all these other things be intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.967" offset="3547199">If that is the case, the law of Maine says that constitutes murder in that law by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.364" offset="3580844">The process by which we do this is a presumption, a so called presumption of malice.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.340" offset="3608743">Mr. Arey, as I understand one of your opponent's contention is that taking the Maine court at its word as to -- in your explanation of how the criminal statute is to be construed, and perhaps conceding for the sake of argument that if that had taken place in this case, there'd be no violation of Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.536" offset="3697560">That the trial judge did charge the jury at that place at I guess page 40 of the appendix where he says “The words malice aforethought are most important because malice aforethought is an essential and indispensable element of the crime of murder.”</text>
            <text syncTime="915.042" offset="3763493">Is that an inconsistency between the trial judge's treatment of the case and the Supreme Court of Maine's treatment?</text>

            <text syncTime="925.251" offset="3804348">There is no question Your Honor, but what this is not the best charge for which to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.041" offset="3835486">I would point out however that when we talk about crimes even when we are known to be talking about degrees, we sometimes use the word crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.957" offset="3867251">For example, we speak about the crime of first degree murder and yet we know that first degree murder is nothing more than a degree of a crime to a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.361" offset="3908838">I would suggest that the language of the court if read in context, the context within which the charge is given fairly supports the rational of the Maine law court as announced in Wilbur, Rollins, and Lafferty.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.838" offset="3966725">I would suggest that you do not start in the middle of the charge where the judge is talking about palliation and assuming that the state has proven an intentional and unlawful killing, but that you start at the beginning of the charge and read it from beginning to end given all of the assumptions, excuse me, that must come from what is fairly read in the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.949" offset="4063169">I further would cite that -- that not only did the Maine law court say precisely that this is what they had done and as according to the language of Justice Weber in the original Wilbur appeal, the court at instruction was predicated by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.687" offset="4122102">And this is the instruction about the use of the language to which Your Honor is referring, language which is inconsistent perhaps with the position of the Maine law court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.011" offset="4251460">That is the assumption that has been throughout this case at the time that the judge is talking about mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.507" offset="4273403">It's not on the assumption of the Maine law court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.651" offset="4281971">It's the assumption of the Federal District Court in its opinion, first opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.143" offset="4299943">And it's the decision of the First Circuit after the remand of State v. Lafferty that the jury had first been instructed that there was an intentional and an unlawful killing proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the presumption arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.525" offset="4361488">Now malice aforethought as Maine views it, and as I have indicated as nothing more than a term of act, having no independent meaning of viability apart from the context out of which it arose, and that is that felonious homicide which are intentional shall have attributed to them the highest degree of blame within this for punishment purposes, wherein again we call this policy the so called presumption of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.277" offset="4456469">Now what is voluntary manslaughter within the concept of felonious homicide?</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.240" offset="4472351">The punishment category of voluntary manslaughter has precisely the same elements that murder does an intentional and an unlawful killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.745" offset="4510386">But the unlawful killing must have been generated by heat of passion on sudden adequate provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.790" offset="4534523">It constitutes nothing more than a mitigating factor to the charge of felonious homicide punishable as murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.335" offset="4564720">To explain this further, in a charge for manslaughter, the state would not necessarily bear the burden on the fact -- on the issue of heat of passion on sudden adequate provocation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.532" offset="8101491">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.470" offset="8113298">My name is Peter Rubin and I represent the respondent in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.173" offset="8132106">The first issue which I would like to discuss relates to the history in Maine of this concept of felonious homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.365" offset="8164812">As Mr. Arey pointed out, the District Court did reject that concept and the First Circuit Court of Appeals in its first decision also rejected that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.724" offset="8202219">The Maine court then came forward with some subsequent decisions in which it delineated the rational behind that particular concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.970" offset="8239208">However, I would submit to this Court that the concept has no basis in the history of Maine that the -- in Maine, the crimes have always been murder and manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.910" offset="8295006">The case is supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.587" offset="8301693">The state refers to one case, State v. Connolly which talks about in terms about double jeopardy the underlying felony being the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.527" offset="8337429">But even in the context in that case, the court refers to the crime of murder and the crime of manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.936" offset="8367104">The statutes refer to murder and manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.630" offset="8377866">They don't refer to felonious homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.980" offset="8391241">And although, perhaps ordinarily, it is true that a federal court is bound to accept the law of a state as it is annunciated by that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.235" offset="8436276">I think that his interpretation and perhaps one reason that the charge here is so much in conflict with the concept of felonious homicide is that the charge itself does reflect accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.146" offset="8475982">The charge -- the law in Maine as it had been given by numerous judges in the past, and then the Maine law court came forward with its new concept of felonious homicide and that's why the conflicts appear, I believe, between the trial judge's charge and the concepts in Lafferty and Rollins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.064" offset="8559679">I think a review of the common law of other states also will show that there's no other state which has ever developed this concept of felonious homicide being the underlying single crime at common law, and that the other states recognize the crimes -- crime of murder and manslaughter to be separate and distinct crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.075" offset="8643688">Well, are you saying that the State of Maine cannot construe its own law in that way?</text>

            <text syncTime="2141.645" offset="8669915">I -- certainly the State of Maine could construe its law that way, I think perhaps prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.263" offset="8692381">I'm not sure that in the context of this case where I believe historically the law of Maine was -- never utilized this concept of felonious homicide that it would be proper to do it in the context of this case and cases prior to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.760" offset="8754448">Now, I don't take the position State of Maine couldn't do it for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.606" offset="8769808">I just don't think there's any support in Maine law for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.600" offset="8781824">I think that on that basis, the First Circuit and Judge Gignoux were correct, First Circuit the first time around and Judge Gignoux in his opinion that a federal court should not be bound to accept the law of Maine in this context, but should be free to examine the law itself and to come to a conclusion that malice aforethought is an essential element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.196" offset="8872208">State v. Mary in 1936 said that malice aforethought is an essential element and that it's a fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.561" offset="9081605">Well, I took the position with the First Circuit that all the remand said was reconsideration, I'm sorry, further consideration it did not say reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.305" offset="9116609">And I took the position that there was a distinction there that this Court was remanding it because an intervening case had come down and that it wanted to give the First Circuit an opportunity to review its decision in light of that intervening decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.964" offset="9175228">I -- obviously the First Circuit did not accept that argument and went on to decide the case on the merits rather than sticking to its original decision as to its obligation to accept the law of Maine as annunciated by the Maine court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.191" offset="9236146">The concept of malice aforethought itself, let's assume for a moment there was and always has been a concept of felonious homicide in Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.580" offset="9265716">There is no absolutely no support for the proposition that malice aforethought is not a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.861" offset="9290794">Even in State v. Connolly, which is again the major case on which the state relies, the court said “The state must affirmatively show malice aforethought.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.735" offset="9334262">It talks about it as if it were a fact, so that even accepting the concept of felonious homicide, malice aforethought itself is not a public policy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.813" offset="9378670">Never has been in Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.250" offset="9384417">It's always been a fact which the state -- which has been one of the elements for the state to prove which they have traditionally proved by a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.221" offset="9420257">I think there's ample evidence here historically in the law of Maine which is directly inconsistent with this concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.687" offset="9454111">I don't believe that a federal court should be foreclosed from protecting the federal constitution in a case merely because a state court comes up with an interpretation which is new and sudden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.060" offset="9503640">And I recognize that this is not identical to the Bouie case in terms of the situation there and that there was prejudice to the defendant when he went in and then sat down at the counter, he wasn't -- didn't have notice of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.035" offset="9559542">But nevertheless, in this charge the whole trial proceeded on the basis that malice aforethought was an essential element, it was a fact and then the Maine court came forward with its interpretation which removes that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.252" offset="11036400">In this context it seems to me, and that really gets into the third issue on the merits in this case as I see it, which is does In re Winship, the rational of In re Winship apply to penalty categorizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.066" offset="11103587">I think there's an intermediate issue which is much narrower, and which I think it's important for this Court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.635" offset="11125948">And that is that is if you review the charge in this case, it is quite clear that the judge did not charge that the jury had to prove an intentional and unlawful killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.370" offset="11160848">He only charged that the state must prove an unlawful killing and then malice aforethought is presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.836" offset="11186761">And if you look at the court's definition of malice aforethought, it is quite clear that that definition comprises the concept of intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.617" offset="11225840">So what the trial judge was saying to the jury was once the state proves an unlawful killing, which in essence was that the defendant killed the victim, there arises a presumption of malice aforethought, presumption of intent either a subjective intent to kill or the implied malice, and then the burden of proof shifts the defendant to disprove the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.599" offset="11309746">And I would refer to -- it's interesting to note that the jury did come back for further instructions, and at that time the trial judge says “All unlawful killings are presumed to be with malice aforethought.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.190" offset="11516113">In fact in this case, the judge erroneously charged the jury that malice aforethought, i.e. intent, was to be presumed until the defendant came forward with evidence by a preponderance of the evidence and disproved intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.662" offset="11917981">Then at top of page 38 in the appendix he says “I'm going to leave for now, my suggestion, my language concerning what the jury finding of what the defendant intended.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.213" offset="11952253">And I submit from that point on, there was never a reference again to the fact that the defendant -- the state must prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.447" offset="11981197">It was always in terms of the presumption of malice aforethought, the presumption of intent once the state had proved an unlawful killing and the defendant must disprove intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.124" offset="12019858">So that I think even reading the charge in its entirety, it's quite clear that the judge proceeded on the basis that the state satisfies its burden of proof on intent by a presumption of intent after it has proven certain other facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.739" offset="12342314">I'd now like to move on to the third issue to which Mr. Justice White referred, and I would submit that the rational, the underlying rational of In re Winship applies equally even when you're considering factual matters which go to punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.631" offset="12397902">Clearly if you accept the concept of felonious homicide as enunciated by the Maine court, then heat of passion on sudden provocation which relates to voluntary manslaughter is a fact which merely distinguishes punishment categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.925" offset="12451088">Certainly though, in the context of Winship, the difference between life imprisonment and a maximum of 20 years is quite substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.254" offset="12488391">Certainly also, the difference between a conviction of murder and manslaughter in terms of the stigma that's attached is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.578" offset="12521723">I think in Lafferty, the Maine court recognizes that murder has this high degree of blame worthiness, whereas manslaughter is mitigated and it isn't considered quite so blame worthy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter J. Rubin</label>
            <text syncTime="3120.081" offset="12583685">Well, I think that gets into the third consideration for the court which is whether or not there're any counterbalancing factors which do not warrant shifting the burden of proof or putting the burden of proof on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.871" offset="12642826">I would say that in this situation, when you're talking about heat of passion and sudden provocation, the facts which prove the killing by the state, which the state obviously has to prove, will also go a long ways to resolving the factual issue of heat of passion on sudden provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.841" offset="12702699">It'll show perhaps the difference in time there that between the provocation, if there was some, and the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.548" offset="12729553">It will show just how the killing occurred perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.554" offset="12745540">These are objective factors which I think are equally available to the state as they are to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.594" offset="12765706">Whereas when you're talking about insanity, I think you're much more severely limited to a state of mind which is not shown by objective factors, it's shown more by subjective factors, perhaps its more difficult in that situation for the state to come up with evidence, and that would be a reason when you're balancing the difficulties of proof in this situation to say it to distinguish the question of insanity from the question of -- present in this case of heat of passion on sudden provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.684" offset="12882108">I think that clearly, there is much evidence that's equally available to the state as to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.605" offset="12913768">Furthermore, I think the issue in Winship revolves around whether or not when the court said at the beginning of its holding that the state must prove every factor essential to the crime, whether when referring to crime, the court was really focusing in on the word crime or the word -- the facts that are essential to the overall determination of what the defendant is guilty of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.629" offset="13025886">Whether its -- whether you're talking about the crime or you're talking about the punishment category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.174" offset="13044067">Certainly, the facts of that case in a strict legal case were not criminal they were juvenile delinquency case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.925" offset="13067055">Furthermore, at the end of the case, there's a reference and an adoption of language by Justice Fuld of the New York court where he talked about proving the case against the defendant or rather than the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.084" offset="13119718">I think it's so important -- one of the other underlying factors in Winship was the intent to minimize the chances of error in a criminal trial, and because of the fact that a defendant could be -- loses liberty, and because of the stigma that attaches to a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.796" offset="13210520">Certainly, that has application whether you're talking about an element of the crime, or whether you're talking about something so important even though it only goes to punishment which distinguishes between the ultimate categorization of what the defendant will be punished for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.989" offset="13271333">And here in this case, the sole distinguishing factor between murder and manslaughter is heat of passion on sudden provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.176" offset="13308113">And it appears to me that if you put the burden of proof on the defendant to prove that it was done in the heat of passion on sudden provocation that you are increasing the chances of error substantially because as, I don't remember if it was Mr. Justice White or who referred to the fact that the jury might if they could use this evidence on the question of reasonable doubt might have a reasonable doubt, but they can not under the instructions and therefore would have to be or be forced to convict the defendant of murder, even though they were exactly even on the question of in the heat of passion on sudden provocation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.726" offset="14102235">I think that's true, but I believe that the question of self-defense can very easily go to one of the elements of the crime in terms of the intent, the unlawfulness of the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.986" offset="14143300">One of the definitions of unlawful is that it is not excusable or justifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.624" offset="14161899">And the definition in Maine anyway of, I'm not sure I'm getting the right one of justifiable I guess it would be is that it was done in self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.506" offset="14189380">So that it seems to me that if that -- the question of self-defense does go to an element of the crime, i.e. that the killing was unlawful and once that there's some evidence into the case of self-defense, there's a question of whether or not the killing was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.277" offset="14256462">And it would seem to me that it would be the obligation of the state at that point to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was unlawful, i.e. that it was not in self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.377" offset="14292929">So that I think that it could very well go strictly to the element of the crime of unlawfulness of the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.986" offset="14335352">I think though that the court could avoid all those issues and avoid all the issues the applicability of Winship to -- in the heat of passion on sudden provocation by deciding this case on the intermediary to the second issue which is discussed, which is that the state in this case or the trial judge in this case placed the burden of proof as to intent on the defendant to disprove intent once the state had proved an unlawful killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.398" offset="14436916">And as such, the -- it seems to me everybody agrees that intent is an element of the crime of felonious homicide, if that's the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.823" offset="14466696">It's an element of the crime of murder, if murder is the crime.</text>
