            <text syncTime="55.789" offset="326510">Mr. Murray, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew E. Murray</label>
            <text syncTime="56.445" offset="329122">Honorable Chief Justice and may it please this honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.468" offset="361200">I have agreed to divide my time with Mr. Come of the National Labor Relations Board because I felt that the court would like to hear from the agency itself as to how the -- it has been interpreting the question which is before us today and that is the applicability of Sections 554 and the following sections to the 10 (k) hearing process in the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.753" offset="518353">The facts to this case commenced in Elk Grove Village, a little town at the edge of Cook County which includes the Greater Chicago area and the municipality at -- in Elk Grove had given ITT a contract to install all its communication equipment in the new municipal building.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.620" offset="625873">The Local 134 of the IBEW had been doing practically all installation of telephone equipment in Cook County for many years and considered this particular area their private reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.951" offset="703195">So a strike took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.266" offset="716466">IBEW was out there pulling cable and they found out that the ITT employees who were represented by nationwide agreement by the communication workers of America were going to do the installation and they struck the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.076" offset="807685">We filed an 8 (b) (4) (D) charge and after the use of a ten-day period in which the board tries to get the parties to settle a dispute, the matter, the complaint issued and the hearing officer was appointed, the facts were gathered.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.783" offset="922520">Everyone introduced their evidence including the employers and the unions and the 10 (k) was adjudged by the Court to -- was adjudged proper that the communication workers employed by ITT be given this work.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.360" offset="1024815">The other party at that point has ten minutes or ten days rather to tell the Regional Director if they're going to abide by this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.737" offset="1074343">Ten-day period elapsed and they informed the Regional Director that they did not intend to abide by the ruling of the board in the 10 (k) proceeding which of course gave rise to the immediate filing of an 8 (b) (4) (D) charge under Section 10 (b) and (c) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.288" offset="1180505">The 10 (b) charge of course is a prosecutorial proceeding by the Board as opposed to a purely investigative proceeding under 10 (k) and therefore, the Board needs the General Counsel must have a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.757" offset="1274441">And the hearing officer in the 10 (k) proceeding whose duty -- it was merely to gather evidence and submit the record to the Board without recommendation, was appointed as prosecutor in the 10 (b) and (c) unfair labor practice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.407" offset="1369004">Now the Seventh Circuit, there was no objection made to this until the proceedings were concluded and at that point, IBEW in its brief complained that the same man who had sat in the 10 (k) proceeding and heard the evidence was commingling prosecutorial with judicial functions in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.169" offset="1500035">Now, the court both in -- the Board of course overruled this contention, went up to the Seventh Circuit, they found that indeed, IBEW was guilty of 8 (b) (4) (D) without question that this is precisely what the Section had been enacted to prevent but they finally said that they would not enforce the order because they felt that 15 or 10 (k) was subject to 554 etcetera of the Administrative Procedure Act and there was an illegal commingling of judicial and investigative functions, I mean, prosecutorial investigative functions which that Act forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.385" offset="1752900">Now of course, Mr. Come I think will concentrate generally on how the Board has treated 10 (k) with reference to the Administrative Procedure Act over a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.001" offset="1811414">We're all familiar with the fact that the Board has always treated 10 (k) as not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act and in a series of cases, it's so held that these -- this was never challenged by Congress or the courts for a period of 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.091" offset="1891767">We know also that the board has --</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="448.871" offset="1898872">Mr. Murray, then you don't agree with Judge Morrow's observation in his opinion and I quote, “It is apparently admitted that Section 554 applies to 10 (k) hearings.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="matthew_e_murray" startTime="460.318" stopTime="611.225">
            <label>Mr. Matthew E. Murray</label>
            <text syncTime="460.318" offset="1944639">There is absolutely no basis in the record for that statement of Judge Morrow's.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.970" offset="1967208">It's a completely false assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.435" offset="1989151">It was contented by the attorneys for Local 134 but there was never any admission of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.075" offset="2043695">So, this is the key to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.662" offset="2061981">Judge Morrow did not cite any authority or any -- make any reference to the record in support of this observation simply because it was not fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.219" offset="2132198">Now, in making this unwarranted observation and assumption, in addition to ignoring everything that the National Labor Relations Board has done on this -- in this matter, the U.S. Courts of Appeal have had a case when they examined this.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.369" offset="2260825">The most recent decision, well, the second most recent decision was the D.C. Circuit in Bricklayers and in that case, Judge Feess flatly holds that 10 (k) proceedings are not applicable to the administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.430" offset="2337102">And in that case, the issue was whether trial examiners should be used instead of hearing officers and there's quite a distinction between a hearing officer and a trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.063" offset="2411604">Judge Morrow sees to -- sees fit to use the word interchangeably but they are quite different -- sorts of animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.871" offset="2454862">A hearing officer is forbidden by board regulation for making any recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.544" offset="2481507">Its sole function is investigatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.162" offset="2496031">Whereas it is incumbent and is required by a hearing -- an administrative law judge or a trial examiner that he make a recommended decision.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="611.225" offset="2548276">I gather that the hearing officer is not in this new category of administrative or judge?</text>

          <turn speaker="matthew_e_murray" startTime="615.077" stopTime="753.471">
            <label>Mr. Matthew E. Murray</label>
            <text syncTime="615.077" offset="2563636">No he is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.481" offset="2569279">He was simply an employee of the thirteenth region and he sat and heard the case, sent the record to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.470" offset="2609298">That was his sole function.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.109" offset="2615777">He did make evidentiary rulings but there is nothing in the record to indicate that there were any improper evidentiary rulings either in the Board decisions or the Seventh Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.551" offset="2677530">So, that particular thing, the prejudice is not apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.722" offset="2718281">If there was any, it's certainly is not apparent from the record in any way, shape or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.493" offset="2745344">Now, there was also a very recent case down the Fifth Circuit, Shell Chemical which is cited in the Board's brief which was actually decided after our brief was filed which support Bricklayers in every respect in this particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.193" offset="2840116">And of course this Court has had an opportunity to examine and to discuss this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.473" offset="2877315">But Mr. Justice White in the Plasterer's case discussed the nature of 10 (k) and he emphasized the fact that no one is bound by a 10 (k) decision, not either of the unions nor the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.558" offset="2989641">Of course, the judge did say further that the 10 (k) determination of the Board which requires incidentally a different modicum of proof than the regular unfair labor practice case that it nevertheless had a very strong effect on the 10 (b) and (c) case which followed on the 8 (b) (4).</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="753.471" offset="3117223">Does it ever happen that a 10 (k) winner loses in the unfair labor practice?</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew E. Murray</label>
            <text syncTime="759.603" offset="3141778">Not to my knowledge Your Honor but I think perhaps Mr. Come would have more information on that subject than do I.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.495" offset="3209383">What the -- the most important area here is the practical results that would ensue if the 10 (k) determination were to be held to be in adjudication under Section 554.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.848" offset="3286810">This would require indeed that you have administrative law judges rather than hearing officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.148" offset="3315963">We would have to await the appointment of an administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.201" offset="3336129">Now, we must not forget that the passage of 10 (k) by Congress was to expedite the settling of jurisdictional disputes.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="820.039" offset="3383568">We'll resume there at 1 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.886" offset="3454934">Mr. Murray, you may continue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="matthew_e_murray" startTime="840.422" stopTime="1174.113">
            <label>Mr. Matthew E. Murray</label>
            <text syncTime="840.422" offset="3465070">As was saying at the recess, the -- there was unanimous opinion practically in this contrary, for the need for the legislation to quickly settle jurisdictional strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.871" offset="3522853">Congress was very much in the mood and it's certainly was their intent, the unions wanted it, the employers wanted it and even President Truman sent a special message regarding this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.657" offset="3585964">But unfortunately, it hasn't worked out as well as it was hoped.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.178" offset="3616057">However, if this decision is allowed to stand, we might suggest that it's been in litigation for four years at this point and the jurisdictional dispute is still not settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.634" offset="3689932">The board has furnished us with statistics showing that even to -- if you had an 8 (b) (2) or (3) -- (2) and (3) case with a trial examiner which would be required under the Administrative Procedure Act that the average time elapsed before the final Board order is 374 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.452" offset="3805184">So, obviously, this is going to completely for a congressional intent if this decision is allowed to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.383" offset="3856906">The statute will have to be amended, something will have to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.475" offset="3881253">But the fact is, as many of this 8 (b) (2)'s and 8 (b) (3)'s as I've participated in, I have never seen one that ended inside a two years including the appeal to the circuit court.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.711" offset="3954186">You have submitted findings of fact, inclusions of law, briefs, exceptions, briefs, motion for reconsideration, more briefs, lots of time to appeal to the appellate court and more briefs and oral arguments and motions for rehearing with more briefs and it is simply not -- it cannot be an expeditious way of settling this very real problem which causes so much havoc in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.459" offset="4125236">And the wording of the statute does not justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.024" offset="4143417">The -- we're warned in the early stages of the act that the definitions are not to be taken too seriously as defining the scope of the act that there maybe a number of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.118" offset="4211858">Also, in 554 proper, we have the exception that it does not apply to a certification of work or representatives which really in the last analysis is what 10 (k) amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.308" offset="4276642">It -- in the case of 9 (c) proceeding, they are certifying workers for a particular plan or particular unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.205" offset="4320214">In a 10 (k) proceeding, they are certifying workers for a particular type of work and it's by enlarged, it's the same, same thing, both proceedings conducted by hearing officers without recommendation to the Board merely vehicles to elicit evidence and transport the record to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.069" offset="4435675">We therefore submit that this unwarranted assumption, completely unwarranted assumption of Judge Morrow that the act is applicable should be disregarded because there's nothing in the Act, there's nothing in the record to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.879" offset="4518849">Now, furthermore and lastly, no prejudice could have resulted it here as for instance in the case of Young Wong Sung or I don't recall the exact wording of that case where you have a prosecutor building a case and then sitting in judgment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.843" offset="4602755">Here, this hearing officer could not possibly know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.922" offset="4619055">Again, contrary to one of Judge Morrow's assumptions, he could not know to whom the work would be awarded by the Board or whether they're in fact would be a 10 (b) (4) or a 10 (4) -- 10 (b) (4) (D) file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.786" offset="4718529">He couldn't know that, he had no way of knowing that he would be the prosecutor and there's just nothing to justify any exception to the procedures that were taken in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.460" offset="4785194">Thank you very much for your patience Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.950" offset="4823124">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.204" offset="4856142">As Mr. Murray has indicated, a 10 (k) hearing which this Court had occasioned to become familiar with in the Plasterer's case three years ago is not an adversary or accusatory proceeding like an unfair labor practice proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.507" offset="4925419">Its purpose is not to determine whether an unfair labor practice has been committed but rather to obviate the need for such a determination by resolving the underlying jurisdictional dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.164" offset="4984038">It is held like a representation case hearing not before an administrative law judge but a hearing officer who is an employee of the regional office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.765" offset="5030431">And the hearing officer's function is solely to develop a full record so that the Board may determine which of two competing groups is entitled to claim the work in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.051" offset="5079542">The evidentiary material relates primarily to such matters as the employee's skills, area employer and industry practice, collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.292" offset="5128547">In short, the type of economic material or administrative material which rarely presents credibility issues and as for that reason, that the hearing officer doesn't make any credibility determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.972" offset="5199287">The close of the hearing, the case is transmitted to the Board for a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.845" offset="5218722">The hearing officer prepares an analysis of the issues but does not as I say, make any credibility determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.663" offset="5254040">He makes no recommendations, just as in the -- as in the representation proceeding, procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.475" offset="5297298">The board makes its determination on the basis of the record developed by the hearing officer, his analysis of the record which contains no recommendations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.239" offset="6556296">It says, this Section applies according to the provisions thereof in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing and then you have a list of six exceptions, the sixth being the certification of worker representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.860" offset="6646784">Now, we submit that a 10 (k) determination is not an adjudication within the meaning of 554 and if it isn't within 554 then the -- everything else follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.606" offset="6749811">We submit that it's not within 554 for at least -- for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.367" offset="6784815">In the first place, it is not an adjudication because an adjudication is defined as “agency process for the formulation of an order” and order means the whole or part of a final disposition of an agency in a matter other than rule making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.961" offset="6871228">And we submit that a 10 (k) determination is not a final disposition of the matter which invoked the Board's processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.896" offset="6910934">The matter that invoked the Board's processes was the 8 (b) (4) (D) charge that is not resolved by the 10 (k) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.942" offset="6947192">You may never get an 8 (b) (4) (D) proceeding at the -- at least you don't know that at the time that the 10 (k) determination is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.968" offset="6991287">Secondly, we submit that even if it were an adjudication within the meaning of the APA, it is not an adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.705" offset="7058160">Although the statute does require if the Board is to make the determination that it shall have a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.737" offset="7098284">It does not go on and specify the nature of that hearing and under this Court's decision in the Florida Railway case and Allegheny-Ludlum which was cited in our brief, the court has made plain that Congress was using the term to determine on the record after opportunity for a hearing specifically for the purpose of screening out of those situations where there was a hearing requirement but not a formal hearing requirement and I might say that a Board hearing is only an alternative if the parties are unable by some private means of adjustment to work out the jurisdictional dispute and certainly that doesn't have to be a record type hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.975" offset="7335267">And thirdly, we say that if we fail on those two counts, we believe that we -- it is possible to read the 10 (k) proceeding as falling within the -- our case exception six certification of worker representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.289" offset="8028557">I think Mr. Come has -- excuse me, correctly noted that the primary issue before the court based upon the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision which states very clearly that the Administrative Procedure Act particularly Section 554 does apply to the Labor Board's 10 (k) hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.237" offset="8120299">He has noted correctly that the basic question is whether the Board's 10 (k) hearing is an adjudication within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.126" offset="8395839">I don't believe -- I don't believe it was ever admitted on the record, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.678" offset="8410049">You are correct in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.628" offset="8417886">But I think that the basic question or 554 does in reality apply to the 10 (k) hearings particularly in light of this Court's decision in the Plasterer's case must be viewed in light of what the purpose of the Administrative Procedure Act was designed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.838" offset="8494686">And as the Court of Appeals noted and was explained very fully in the Wong case, the whole purpose of the Administrative Procedure Act was to set down the outer limits within which the administrative agencies could operate and particularly to prevent the commingling of functions particularly the prosecutorial function with the adjudicative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.861" offset="8602833">And in so, setting out in the Administrative Procedure Act, Section 554 was specifically designed and in its Subsection D in the second paragraph specifically prevented commingling of these functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.627" offset="8669915">Now, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that there was no exception to be granted to the Labor Board in its 10 (k) hearings from the application of Section 554 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.384" offset="8720906">Indeed I might note that in the Labor Management Relations Act, Congress has stated that the Labor Board in the performance of its functions under the Labor Management Relations Act must provide and follow rules in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act and that may be the source of the Seventh Circuit in Judge Morrow's comment about, it is conceded that 554 applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.510" offset="8829367">But in any event, I think if we look at Section 551, as well as, Section 554, the Court of Appeals' decision that the 10 (k) hearing is an adjudication within the meaning of Section 554 is a valid conclusion and further that no exception lies particularly because the 10 (k) hearing is not the same as a representation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.976" offset="8939290">I think that the language of 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act has been passed upon numerous times by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.536" offset="8973563">We cited the Wyman-Gordon case in which this Court said through Mr. Justice Black that a representation case meets the criteria of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.997" offset="9035316">This rationale has been affirmed by this Court as late as Mr. Justice Powell's decision in the Bell Aerospace case and as I believed referred to also in other decisions including Florida East Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.789" offset="9098533">So that it's clear that the Labor Board proceedings are within the ambit of the Administrative Procedure Act as adjudications particularly under Section 551.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.385" offset="9140955">Then the critical question becomes, is there anything in Section 554 that would take the Labor Board proceedings, particularly the 10 (k) proceedings out from under the application of Section 554 and I submit that the Court of Appeals clearly found and correctly found that the 10 (k) proceeding is a part of the agency review which becomes the final part of the Board order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.223" offset="9268224">As Mr. Justice White clearly analyzed in the Plasterer's case, the 10 (k) proceeding is an integral part of the procedure which the Board has provided within the ambit of Section 10 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.128" offset="9327888">In other words, Section 10 of the statute provides that the Labor Board can pursue the unfair labor practice matters and under Section 10 (k) specifically can hear and should hear and determine unfair labor practice matters that are in the jurisdiction dispute area and should decide and award the work in question to one of the two competing unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.146" offset="9431960">This rationale of the Plasterer's case of course picked up and adopted the CBS decision in which the Board was admonished to make a determination in jurisdictional dispute matters and under Section 10 (k) to award the work to one of the competing unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.032" offset="9503535">But I think that when we look at the Plasterer's decision, we have to see if there's anything in there, in that decision which would make the 10 (k) proceedings other than an integral part of the unfair labor practice under Section 8 (b) (4) (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.342" offset="9584724">The Court of Appeals where Justice Morrow found that this was an integral part of the Board's final order which is the unfair labor practice decision in the 8 (b) (4) (D) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.444" offset="9633102">I submit that that is a correct statement of the law and that the Plasterer's' analysis of the Labor Board procedure fully warrants the application on -- of the principle that the Administrative Procedure Act, Section 554 must apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.342" offset="9712724">Now, the Board as I said earlier takes a position that the representation case is the same as the 10 (k) hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.266" offset="9764446">We submit that this is not the same proceedings because the object of the two hearings is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.132" offset="9799868">In the representation case Section 9 of the statute gives the Board authority to direct -- to conduct elections and in the course of that authority to conduct elections has the right to hold hearings in which to determine the correct and appropriate bargaining unit which should be the subject of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.096" offset="9899760">However, in Section 10 (k) of the -- excuse me, in Section 10 of the Labor Management Relations Act, an entirely different problem is approached that of unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.993" offset="9943333">An integral part of Section 10 is the 10 (k) proceeding by which Congress said to the Labor Board, you may hear rather than may, you must hear and determine the jurisdictional dispute which underlies the unfair labor practice proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.416" offset="10013027">So that when the board decides the 10 (k) aspect, the jurisdictional question, that decision is and of course it is termed a decision and determination of dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.244" offset="10064332">That decision is then picked up and absorbed into the subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding should there be an unfair labor practice hearing on the 8 (b) (4) (D) question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.942" offset="10115114">So that within the definition section of the Administrative Procedure Act, Section 551, clearly the 10 (k) proceeding is a part of the final order which the Board does come down with in the unfair labor practice matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.748" offset="10190346">So in other words, we have an absorption of the 10 (k) decision into the unfair labor practice decision and under the Board's own rules, we find that the 10 (k) matter is an integral part of the final order of the unfair labor practice matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.410" offset="10265057">2So, we submit that the Court of Appeals was correct when it found that Section 554 does apply because -- to the 10 (k) hearings because the 10 (k) hearing is a part of the agency process leading to its final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.961" offset="10347186">The arguments presented primarily in the briefs by the Labor Board and ITT is that the detrimental effects will flow from affirming the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.118" offset="10427852">We submit that these arguments as to detrimental effect are not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.004" offset="10455437">The first and basic argument is that there will be a necessity for judicial review of Section 10 (k) determinations if the Seventh Circuit opinion is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.093" offset="10515728">In other words, if the 10 (k) decision is found to be an adjudication under the Administrative Procedure Act, necessarily, judicial review must follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.078" offset="10555643">We submit that this conclusion is not warranted and that the Seventh Circuit recognized clearly that the 10 (k) proceeding is only the first step leading to the final order of the Labor Board which is the ultimate unfair labor practice determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.082" offset="10635682">So that the Board's own rules and regulations proscribed what is a final and therefore reviewable order under the provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.836" offset="10690748">In other words, Section 10 (e) and (f) gave to the Labor Board at the -- excuse me, under Section 10 (f) gave to a party aggrieved the privilege of appealing to the Court of Appeals from a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.261" offset="10764413">Likewise in Section 10 (e), a Labor Board may petition for enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.802" offset="10786565">The question of what is a final order within the ambit of Section 10 (f) was left to the Board because that Section is silent as to the definition of a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.370" offset="10828884">Therefore, under the basic concept and principle that the exhaustion of administrative remedies must be followed by any litigant before an administrative agency, Local 134 and any other litigant before the Labor Board must look at and follow the Labor Board's rules if they are not overruled by higher authority, particularly this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.171" offset="10928044">There has been no decision by this Court that the Section 10 (k) hearing is a final and appealable order of the Labor Board and I think in reading the Plasterer's case, we see rather clearly that the two-step procedure, in other words, the unfair labor -- the 10 (k) hearing and the subsequent unfair labor practice hearing and decision are really two parts of one process designed and certainly a clear part of the scheme that Section 10 of the statute sets out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.511" offset="11093452">The Labor Board itself has determined that no appeal shall be, had from any 10 (k) determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.614" offset="11125844">Now, the decision in the Shell case was cited to this Court, if I might point out that case presents an entirely different question because in that case the Labor Board dismissed the 10 (k) notice of hearing or in other words, said, we are finding -- we are making no decision and finding no basis for awarding the work to either the competing unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.317" offset="11252590">The Court of Appeals in the Shell case concluded that this was not a final order and therefore was not reviewable under Section 10 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.987" offset="11299297">I might point out to the Court that this is exactly contrary to the decision of the Ninth Circuit in a Waterways Terminal case where the Ninth Circuit held that the dismissal of a 10 (k) notice of hearing is in fact a final order and therefore an appealable order from the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.356" offset="11384769">I should note also for the Court that there is a petition for certiorari filed in the Shell case, so that that issue may be presented to this Court or is presented to the Court and maybe ruled upon later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.512" offset="11433462">Now, the second area that has been argued as the basis for overturning the Seventh Circuit decision is that necessarily, an administrative law judge will have to be appointed to hear the Section 10 (k) hearings if the Seventh Circuit decision holding that the 10 (k) hearing is an adjudication is allowed to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.294" offset="11540564">We submit and have argued in part four of our brief that this conclusion does not necessarily follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.961" offset="11571179">There are number of reasons why that conclusion does not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.526" offset="11601481">Initially, the argument was made by Local 134 to the Seventh Circuit that the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Section 556 and 557 which proscribe and require or prescribe and require the administrative law judge be appointed should apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.351" offset="11692805">Shortly prior to the argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia decided the Bricklayers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.107" offset="11735751">On the Bricklayers case, the Court of Appeals found that the 10 (k) hearings need not have an administrative law judge appointed to hear those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.539" offset="11793533">The Seventh Circuit though interestingly enough did not rule upon the contention of Local 134 that an administrative law judge must be appointed to hear 10 (k) matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.766" offset="11838464">So that we have in the decision of the Seventh Circuit no finding, no order that the administrative law judge be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.268" offset="11876394">On that basis, we feel that by affirming the decision of the Seventh Circuit, there is no requirement placed upon the Board that it holds its future 10 (k) hearings by appointing an administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.597" offset="11937729">Secondly, we submit that Section 554 of the Administrative Procedure Act is divisible and not necessarily an integral part of Sections 556 and 557.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.728" offset="11998333">In other words, the nature of those various sections is sufficiently different so that they need not be considered as one complete entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.729" offset="12050265">There is reference in Section 554 as in Section 553, the Administrative Procedure Act to the hearing requirements of Section 556 and 557.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.338" offset="12100733">However, in Section -- Subsection (d), particularly the second paragraph which prohibits the commingling of functions, there is no reference to Section 556.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.705" offset="12158203">There is a -- I want to submit an oblique reference to Section 557 but it is our position that it does not necessarily follow from the Seventh Circuit's decision that Section 556 and Section 557 must apply to all Labor Board 10 (k) hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.402" offset="12249004">I believe that this Court's opinion through Mr. Justice Rehnquist in the Florida East Coast Railway case recognizes the general principle that and in that case it was Section 553 of the statute, the rule making section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.621" offset="12313893">The principle was recognized that it's not necessarily correct or true that Sections 556 and 557 must apply when the provisions of Section 553 apply to -- in administrative agencies hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.067" offset="12383692">We submit likewise that it is not necessarily true particularly under the posture of the case that has come up to this Court from the Seventh Circuit in the nature of the decision that Sections 556 and 557 must be applied to the Labor Board's 10 (k) hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.859" offset="12466761">I think that in this regard also, we should notice and note the fact that the Labor Board itself by its own rules has held and or we should say has promulgated the rule that in 10 (k) hearings, administrative law judges need not be appointed and as we argue in our brief at greater detail, we believe that the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies here also, that in other words, as long as the Labor Board's rule is not in and of itself violative of some other provision of the federal statute such as the commingling of functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.049" offset="12655574">But as long as there is no apparent, obvious violation of the federal statutes, then the Labor Board's rules must be followed and we must as any litigant before the agency must exhaust the remedies, must follow the rules proscribed by that agency for the respective type of matter that comes before the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.487" offset="12749302">In this case, the Labor Board says through its rules that the 10 (k) hearing will be heard not by an administrative law judge but rather by one of its other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.353" offset="12792769">We submit that there is no conflict between the Seventh Circuit decision and the Labor Board's rules as they now stand which do not require the administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.050" offset="12871555">Finally, I think that the argument that the Board has made in its brief that the -- and as Mr. Come has noted here today that it has consistently followed the practice set out in its rule of appointing one of its employees other than an administrative law judge to hear the Section 10 (k) hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.102" offset="12959744">And that this is as Mr. Come said, entitled to great weight and if there is no change in policy, I think, it should not be given as much deference as Mr. Come would have it because this Court in the CBS case had noted to the Board that for many years, it had consistently -- the Labor Board that is, had consistently not decided which of the two competing unions in Section 10 (k) hearings would be entitled to do the work in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.648" offset="13094013">And in the CBS case, this Court very clearly said to the Labor Board, “You have not been doing the function which Congress has said you must perform here, that is decide and award the work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.048" offset="13151587">So that the fact that the Labor Board has proceeded in this manner for many years while it -- is of some weight, I think is not a persuasive weight and I may point to the Court this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.221" offset="13216266">The Board has never contended that it consistently or even in any case has had the same employee performing the function of hearing the 10 (k) jurisdictional dispute matter and then serving as prosecutor in the subsequent unfair labor practice matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.376" offset="13296828">In other words, as the Board's brief sets out rather clearly, this is a rare if ever occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.644" offset="13329951">I think that leads us to the -- to our final argument that there is really no injury or harm to the Labor Board by the decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.042" offset="13387525">In other words, the Board is required under the Seventh Circuit decision to not commingle prosecutorial with adjudicative functions and specifically is prevented from appointing the same employee to the role of hearing officer in a 10 (k) hearing as it has performed the prosecutorial role in the subsequent unfair labor practice case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.231" offset="13528273">I think the prejudice in this case, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Blackmun is that at the 10 (k) hearing, the administrative -- excuse me, the employee who was the hearing officer made rulings on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.037" offset="13599535">One of his basic rulings was that the union was not entitled to pursue evidence by means of a subpoena as to the execution of the original contract between the company and the other union in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.707" offset="13670170">And consequently, the Local 134 was precluded from presenting evidence in support of one of its major contentions, namely, that the collective bargaining agreement between the company and the other union was not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.595" offset="13737775">Now, this ruling made by the hearing officer was unfortunately of such magnitude that it not only took away one of our major contentions but then when the Labor Board decided the determination of the dispute, the Labor Board's primary criteria was that there was a collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the other union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.477" offset="13837249">Now, we submit that the Labor Board's reliance upon that contract after precluding our seeking evidence which as part of our position was that the contract was not valid, took away a very substantial part of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.708" offset="13898167">And I might note that one of the questions although not decided by the Seventh Circuit but which we argued to the Seventh Circuit was that there was -- there is a clear decision of the Sixth Circuit, the Dayton Motel's case which holds that the Labor Board should not close its eyes to relevant evidence merely because it may be beyond the Labor Board's time period of the six-month Section 10 (b) requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.950" offset="14627192">Well, I think our basic position there is that the language of Section 554 particularly in Section D sub -- paragraph two which is the exact language which prevents the commingling of functions makes no reference to Section 556.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.384" offset="14700857">As I say, there is an oblique reference to Section 557 but we submit that that language of Section 554 (d) -- subparagraph (d) second paragraph is divisible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.164" offset="14744012">In other words, it talks about, there shall be no commingling of functions between -- in play engaged in the prosecutorial or investigative functions with the decision making functions but it divides the decision making into three different categories: decision, recommended decision which I submit would be a Section 556 type of -- more appropriate than a Section 556 type of decision and agency process under Section 557.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.769" offset="14870444">We believe that those are divisible and as we understand the Labor Board rule, this is a decision of the Board, a decision and determination of election and therefore it falls within the decision category and we think that these are divisible.</text>
