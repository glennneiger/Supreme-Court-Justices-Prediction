            <text syncTime="280.879" offset="1226898">That's correct, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.387" offset="1240900">The three-judge court held the foregoing language requiring the identification of the printer to be unconstitutional and that it infringed on appellees' First Amendment freedoms of speech, freedom of press and the right to assembly and said that there was no compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.566" offset="1305684">Also, the Court held that the statute was void in that the phrase person paying for the advertising is so vague that man of common intelligence would differ as to its meaning and application.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.266" offset="1352391">We present basically four fundamental court -- points to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.461" offset="1369213">First, that the commercial printer's actions do not constitute speech that is protected by the First Amendment and even if it is protected, the First Amendment rights or freedom of speech and freedom to press do not guarantee to them the right to print political advertising anonymously.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.845" offset="1438804">Second, the portion of the statute in question does not substantially infringe upon the commercial printers and publisher's rights to association of privacy and to the extent that there maybe infringement which we denied that there is or were shown in the record in the court below, the state's interest in disclosure is sufficient to justify any infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.249" offset="1520410">Third, assuming arguendo that the printers possess such rights and they are in fact infringed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.797" offset="1546533">The purposes that are served by the reasonable disclosure requirements of Article 1410 (b), further the compelling state interest of protecting electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.964" offset="1591254">And fourth, the term person paying for the advertising is not unconstitutionally void because when you consider the statute in its entirety, any reasonable person exercising common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with the requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.240" offset="1660322">Now, before expanding on these four basic points, I believe will benefit the Court if I very briefly comment more on the background of the statute being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.168" offset="1703999">From 1967 until 1973, a period of six years, Texas law required a political advertising as defined in Article 1410 (b), reflect the name and address of either the person paying for the advertising or the printer or publisher of the advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.029" offset="1783515">I might note at this point for the benefit of Court that in the appendix which is supplied to the Court at page 65 is a full copy of the article as appears at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.732" offset="1830327">Significantly, not during the period of six years, not once during that time was challenge made to the term person paying for the advertising as being unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.613" offset="1877870">In 1973, as a result of the experiences of the officers and the people of the State of Texas in which unethical and illegal conduct and political campaigns could not be effectively traced and thus not immediately prevented or prosecuted, the Texas Campaign Reporting and Disclosure Act was passed, designed to inform the public about the financing behind communications intended to influence their votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.635" offset="1981942">Among other reforms, the legislature changed the disclosure requirement from the disjunctive person paying or publisher or printer to the conjunctive, that being disclosure to the public of the name and address of the printer or publisher and the person paying for the advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.110" offset="2055816">It's the change by our legislature of only just one word from “or to and” that brings as before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.441" offset="2089148">As previously pointed out in response the question from Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the amendment as we see before us today was enacted on June 4, 1973 and a suit was filed on September 11, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.239" offset="2148289">There's no evidence presented to the court below that the candidates or political organizations had declined to use plaintiff appellees' commercial services nor that as a result with compliance with the statute that the printers had been harassed or had been intimated or had declined to undertake any commercial, political advertising for fear of reprisal or loss of other business.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.179" offset="2244106">No political candidates appeared before the court below as parties or as amici.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.034" offset="2263542">In fact, the only evidence before the Court was affidavits of individual printers swearing to their fears of a possibility of a reaction if they were to comply with the disclosure requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.447" offset="2313174">No evidence was presented, the prosecutions have been initiated or even considered, nor evidence of how the act would be interpreted nor enforced by the appellant, Secretary of state, Mark White who is charged with the responsibility of enforcing the uniform application of the Texas election laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.828" offset="2386735">Parenthetically, a reading to the testimony of appellees' only to the live witnesses at the hearing of which a temporary restraining order was denied by Judge Singleton reveals that the testimony falls far short of establishing any likelihood of a chilling effect upon First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.684" offset="2462072">To use Mr. Justice Marshall's phrase from this morning, the plaintiff's counsel supports their allegations out of the clear blue sky.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.828" offset="2506689">They are not supported by the evidences in the record in the case we have before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.689" offset="2526124">In sum, the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of proving to the court below or to this Court to declare the disclosure provision unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.974" offset="2571264">Our first point is that the Commercial Printer's actions do not constitute speech as protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.726" offset="2598327">And even as such speech is protected, the First Amendment, freedoms of speech and freedom to press do not guarantee to them the right to print political advertising anonymously.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.270" offset="2644407">The First Amendment protects not the written or spoken word itself but the expression of ideas concerning social policy, political views and religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.487" offset="2685367">Speech or conduct however that expresses nothing of political or social importance is not subject to First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.822" offset="2714624">As Judge Bue points out in his specially concurring opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.841" offset="2730715">these printers by their actions express nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.415" offset="2745031">They do not argue that they are denied the right to print anonymously their own views in support of or in opposition to a particular candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.689" offset="2778154">To the contrary, they seek the right to print anonymously that for which they have no feeling one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.186" offset="2804067">Indeed, they seek to avoid expressing any type of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.264" offset="2820472">They seek constitutional protection to avoid expressing only their name.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.356" offset="2844818">Nor did the printer seek to distribute ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.413" offset="2857044">They merely received orders from their clientèle and return the finished product to the person that has hired their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.251" offset="2892361">The appellees rely very heavily in the Tally versus California case to support their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.067" offset="2911692">We submit that the Tally decision does not in fact support them and is distinguishable from instant case in several very important aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.077" offset="2947636">First, the Los Angeles ordinance requiring identification on all handbills were struck down because of over breadth as to time, as to place and as to circumstance and the lack of any relation to any ongoing governmental interest or responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.831" offset="3014719">The challenged language of Article 1410 applies only in very limited times, that being during a campaign and only to certain groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.375" offset="3044916">Those printing material for such campaign is for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.667" offset="3062053">It clearly does not eliminate anonymous discussions of public matters of importance at all the times or even during an election campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.480" offset="3093295">The purposes articulated by Mr. Justice Black from prohibiting an absolute ban on anonymous printing are far from applicable in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.420" offset="3137076">Now appellee printers have no such lofty purpose for seeking anonymity.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.766" offset="3154422">Rather, basic only to profit in private even if this were speech that were protected under the First Amendment, as Mr. Justice Clark pointed out in his dissenting opinion in Tally, the Constitution says nothing about freedom of anonymous speech nor there's freedom to press as illustrated in the Lewis Publishing Company case provide any such anonymity.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.096" offset="3247731">The Brandsberg decision also illustrates that freedom of press does not guarantee an absolute anonymity especially where substantial, compelling, public interests are shown and demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.300" offset="3308544">As will be discussed in a later point here the state's interests are compelling and when weighed in the scales of justice against any possible infringement, may tilt in favor of the voting rights which our state so fervently attempts to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.954" offset="3379179">The appellants contend that the case more properly fits within the rationale of the Insco case and the Scott case discussed in our brief dealing with the similar federal statute 18 U.S.C. Section 612 which requires identification a person responsible for distribution or publication of political advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.021" offset="3459427">Our second point deals with the asserted right of associational privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.275" offset="3476459">The portion of a statute in question does not substantially infringe upon the commercial printers and publishers’ rights to associational privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.689" offset="3514180">The Printer's main reliance on this point is NAACP versus Alabama and the Bates versus City of Little Rock cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.752" offset="3550333">Now this relies as misplaced for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.930" offset="3563081">First, the rationale in support to the right of associational privacy as they point out in their brief is to protect the right to associate, to advocate and promote political, social and economic actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.126" offset="3615848">The right to freely associate for the purpose of advancing ideas and erring grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.395" offset="3636955">Ironically, the commercial printers do not seek to protect the rights to associate with the political candidate for any such reasons and has made the base of NAACP versus Alabama and Bates, but to the contrary they seek to conceal their identity for fear that someone might think that they do associate with their customers and thus damage their commercial enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.003" offset="3727339">Secondly and more importantly, the holding both the NAACP versus Alabama and in the Bates decision was that in each instance, the law in question imposing some burden on the First Amendment right was not shown to have a relevant or substantial correlation to the state interest sought to be furthered.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.444" offset="3805184">In the case at Bar, the substantial and compelling interests are shown by the state in a limited disclosure requirement of Article 1410.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.671" offset="3842069">The NAACP versus Alabama and the Tally case both recognized that disclosure maybe required when as here the state show good faith efforts to protect a fundamental interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.927" offset="7259094">I want the Court to understand very distinctly that the printers have not in any way challenged the record keeping provisions of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.552" offset="7289605">All that the printers have challenged and attacked is that provision of the Texas Election Code which requires the printers to print their name and address for public dissemination, for public dissemination on the printed material.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.052" offset="11927594">It would -- again the bug system, the coded system would not avail to the voters to know and as the Chief Justice points out would come into the licensing -- prior licensing before they could even go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.862" offset="11990810">There are only two closing points I would make Your Honor would be number one, that the evidence before this Court such as opposing counsel has referred to was not for the record that the three-judge-court, the references made to the problems that the lady have with regard to her feelings about supporting a republican candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.488" offset="12069282">That was at the temporary restraining order but was not a part of the record that the TRO or excuse me at the three-judge-court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.999" offset="12099375">Again, this record is void of law to support the position as well as the facts as developed in this record when considering the record as a whole and therefore we're respectfully pray that this Court reverse the decision of the three-judge-court below.</text>
