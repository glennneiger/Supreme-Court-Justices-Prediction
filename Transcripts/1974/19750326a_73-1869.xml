            <label>Mr. James R. Stoner</label>
            <text syncTime="63.127" offset="355871">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.614" offset="377814">This case comes to the Court as an appeal from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia from a decision by a three-judge court pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.319" offset="428596">It deals with the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.269" offset="444479">The City of New Orleans in 1954 adopted a reorganization of its form of Government and adopted a mayor-council form of Government whereby the mayor of the city assumes the executive functions and a seven-man, seven-person council assumes the legislative functions of the city, the governing of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.402" offset="536952">The plan provides for the two members of the council to be elected at large from the entire city and five members to be elected from specific geographic areas of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.614" offset="601840">Now, the city charter requires that after each federal decennial census, the council of the city has the obligation to redistrict the five geographic areas of the city so that each area in each district will be as nearly as possible consisting of an equal number of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.616" offset="709883">The city charter as I said makes this mandatory after each decennial census.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.412" offset="744991">This case comes to the Court to be adjudicated following the 1970 decennial census in a plan that was adopted by the city council.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.629" offset="793893">But a little bit of history might be appropriate in considering the posture of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.693" offset="822105">First, following the 1970 census, the city council had the obligation to redistrict the five geographical areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.738" offset="866304">They undertook to do this by the adoption of a plan, Plan I, referred to in the briefs in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.103" offset="895770">Now this plan was submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which creates a system whereby a changed plan can be made operative in the event that the Attorney General does not enter an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.655" offset="969958">In this case, while the Attorney General of the United States was considering the plan, there was talk and movement in the city for a procedure whereby the city council, the City of New Orleans could be enlarged and indeed during the time that the Attorney General is considering the first plan, the city council did in fact adopt an ordinance increasing the size of the city council from seven members to 11 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.119" offset="1095868">This 11-member proposal at a member council consisted of two at large and nine geographic.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.000" offset="1127424">This proposal was submitted to the electorate for the City of New Orleans and was defeated in the citywide referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.721" offset="1158248">The city council then adopted a plan whereby the size of the city council would be increased from seven members to nine members with two at large and seven from specific geographic districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.285" offset="1216554">This again was submitted to the electorate and upon the referendum, the proposal was defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.000" offset="1243408">Now, following this, the Attorney General of the United States interposed an objection to Plan I.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.457" offset="1269217">Now, where does that lead the city council of New Orleans?</text>
            <text syncTime="295.863" offset="1286875">It leads the city council of New Orleans with the obligation to redistrict itself for the five geographic districts on the basis of a five geographic district council and two at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.039" offset="1339538">It did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.145" offset="1343927">It adopted what has been referred to in the briefs as Plan II and this plan was submitted to the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.668" offset="1382066">The Attorney General interposed an objection and upon interposing an objection, the interpose -- imposition of the Attorney General's objection, the city brought an action pursuant to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia asking for a declaratory judgment and asking the three-judge court to declare that the plan as adopted that is Plan II be made operative and be held to be in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>

            <label>Mr. James R. Stoner</label>
            <text syncTime="393.574" offset="1677667">That is right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.263" offset="1680384">Now, the District Court, the three-judge District Court held that Plan II was in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and it is that that we disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.485" offset="1733360">Now, let's look at what this case is and maybe the best way to attack what the case is, is to ask what it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.610" offset="1777768">This case is not a case whereby a city or a government is expanding its boundaries, annexing area as prior cases in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.540" offset="1837537">It is not that kind of a case nor is it a case where the city is changing from at large district to single districts or from single districts to at large districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.886" offset="1882885">This is merely a case where the city, the city council is performing its obligation to redistrict itself pursuant to the mandate in the city charter which as I stated was adopted in 1954, became effective in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.862" offset="1950804">So the case before the Court is a redistricting of the five-geographic district.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.502" offset="1985390">Now, the court below held that the two at-large seats had to be considered in the consideration of the five-geographic district and its application under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.153" offset="2063966">We submit and most vehemently that that is not at issue and that this Court should overrule the District Court on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.107" offset="2099806">And for reason we state as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.073" offset="2107643">The Voting Rights Act of 1965 applies to changes that are made in a voting system.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.214" offset="2140244">Now, this Court has held that in addition restrictions on the individual's right to vote, it also applies to cases in which a change in boundaries etcetera and we don't dispute with that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.338" offset="2200743">We do however submit that the form of government enacted by the city council in its charter, in its home rule charter of May 1, 1954 was a dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.982" offset="2247346">It was a system that provided for the election of two members of its council from the entire city at large and it was a system that required the election of five additional members of its city council from geographic districts of equal population -- of equal population.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.169" offset="2324041">Now, it might be helpful for the Court to look at a map of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.484" offset="2349328">I have here which is -- incidentally in the appendix at page 625, 620, a colored map of the City of New Orleans and interposed on that colored map is the five districts as composed in Plan II which is the plan before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.557" offset="2425605">The red portion of this map represents voters of the black race.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.242" offset="2452355">The white, I'm sorry, the green dots represent voters of the white race, so that we see upon an examination of this map that indeed the white and the black voters of the city are scattered throughout many sections of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.215" offset="2536260">Now, in looking at this, I would also like to call the Court's attention to the area in which the number C is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.310" offset="2572622">This is the only part of the City of New Orleans that is across the Mississippi River from the other part of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.158" offset="2603969">In other words, predominantly the geographic, the large predominant part is the one side of the city but there is a small sliver on the other side of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.449" offset="2649213">This section across the river is called Algiers and the record shows that there are great differences of opinion between the people of Algiers and the people of the city as to the necessity of another bridge across the Mississippi River and this is an important political issue in the City of New Orleans not only in the Algiers section but also in the main section of the section of the city itself because voters in one section of the city don't want the bridge to be destroying parts of their city for the abutment and the piers of the bridge etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.508" offset="2789439">Now, this case involves several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.258" offset="2804381">It involves people, it involves geography and it involves voters, of necessity the city must be divided geographically in order to meet the mandate of the city charter of creating the five geographic districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.571" offset="3205622">Now, as I stated, two additional members of the city council are elected at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.799" offset="3226520">In other words, there is a dual system the at large system and the five geographic.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.418" offset="3245014">Now, this apportionment of the city is founded in reason and founded in good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.564" offset="3269674">The two at large members of the city, city council have the obligation of representing of all of the citizens of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.188" offset="3316172">Each geographic district is represented by one person on the council and presumably that person represents the peculiar interest of that geographic area of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.749" offset="3358386">And very important factor in this case is the Mississippi River and the economy of the city of New Orleans as it is affected by the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.732" offset="3402271">The Mississippi River is well-known as the access to the Gulf of Mexico and it is a large and important shipping center of the United States and I guess invade the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.642" offset="3457964">Now, there's testimony in this case and I've referred to the testimony of a Councilman Morrow and I believe that Councilman Ciaccio (ph) also testified concerning this and that is that in their mind, they felt that it was important that each one of these five geographic areas should have some of the river frontage as part of their geographic area because of the tremendous importance of the river and shipping to the economy and to the life of the city and the people of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.474" offset="3601220">Plan II, as adopted by the city council and the plan which is before the Court, is also represented on page 624 of the record comparing the existed plan which is on page 621 and Plan II which is a plan before the Court on page 624.</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.247" offset="12344404">I'd like to address that in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.586" offset="12361749">I believe the intention of Congress in enacting Section 5 particularly as it relates to redistricting plans is set out in the legislative history and in that history, there is a repeated reference to the problem that once black voters get registered in significant numbers because of the application of other sections of the Act, they would still be faced in certain areas under certain political circumstances with being cut off from the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.077" offset="12491630">Cut off at the last step by districting lines which would divide up these newly concentrated, newly enfranchised concentrations of black, submerge them in majority white districts and therefore by effectively divide and conquer this vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.203" offset="12572191">Now, the hearings before Congress particularly didn't leave it just at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.684" offset="12586088">The Congress was well aware of the practices for instance of bloc voting, of non-responsiveness in these jurisdictions to the distinct interest of this minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.882" offset="12630915">In this case as well, the District Court, if you won't reexamine perhaps unnecessarily but reexamine in regard to New Orleans whether it was -- whether these type of factors existed there and they did find that for instance, in New Orleans up to -- there was a large increase in black voting that there was in fact a division of this black voting surrounding that there had been bloc voting in New Orleans and that the key -- that there had never been a black elected to the city council and that the city council have failed historically and continued to fail to respond to the distinct interest of the minority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3367.665" offset="13574040">They predetermined the question of purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.701" offset="13582190">I think the question of purpose however that there's ample evidence in the record to indicate that there was a racially discriminatory purpose and that would provide an alternative basis for this Court's affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.322" offset="13632658">Particularly, the bad faith of the council from Plan I to Plan II, that Act has affirmatively rejected Plan I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.246" offset="13664319">Plan II was hardly a good faith but to correct that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.721" offset="13674245">Also I think the courts are more and more willing to recognize the purposeful discrimination from facts and circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.186" offset="13720116">It's no longer a situation where white officials bend on discrimination would get on the stand and admit that they discriminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.073" offset="13747702">I think there is the type of situation here where the Court could in fact find that there was such a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.772" offset="13782497">I think given the legislative history of Section 5, I think Congress did definitely intend to set up a different standard than the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.457" offset="13829204">And under that standard, they might well be in individual cases say a redistricting plan which would not be acceptable under Section 5 which under a particular constitutional case wouldn't be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.741" offset="13886360">And this has to be characterized a couple of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.769" offset="13906422">It could be characterized merely as an inference of unconstitutional gerrymandering from these facts and circumstances or it could be characterized as a substantive rule but in any effect, I think it's very clear after this Court's decision in South Carolina versus Katzenbach and some other cases that it is quite possible that Section 5 will prohibit a type of arrangement that might not otherwise be unconstitutional on individual case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.296" offset="14060544">Yes sir, I think that's what Congress was intending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.719" offset="14070262">I think it saw that there was discrimination in schools, in education, in jobs and so on in voting, going back down and the reason was that the elected officials were able to ignore the particular interest of the black minority and by appealing to bloc voting and the like and that the Congress intended to eliminate this by preventing the division for instance in redistricting plans of these concentrations of black voters so that the white incumbents or politicians in power couldn't appeal and harness bloc voting in such a way that they could then just ignore the interest of blacks.</text>
