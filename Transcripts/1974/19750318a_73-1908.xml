            <text syncTime="51.866" offset="310836">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.183" offset="328077">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.638" offset="357961">A three-judge panel of which in a divided opinion, reversed the grant of summary judgment which have been entered by Judge Troutman of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the defendants, the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.347" offset="436746">Chief Judge Seitz writing for himself and also for Judge Hastie reversed the grant of summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.644" offset="477915">Judge Aldisert wrote a dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.292" offset="492544">The factual background of the case is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.620" offset="509889">Mr. Ash filed a complaint just a little bit more than five weeks before the presidential election of November 1972 asserting a claim against Bethlehem Steel Corporation and 12 of its directors and senior executive officers claiming on behalf of himself as voter citizen and stockholder and derivatively on behalf of Bethlehem Steel Corporation itself, claiming a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 610 on the basis of a charged plan by the defendants to violate 610 by utilizing the resources of Bethlehem Steel Corporation including the expenditure of corporate funds to bring about a republican victory in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.803" offset="750634">More specifically, there was asserted by the plaintiff below that corporate funds were expended for ads which appeared in magazines of national circulation and also, in newspapers which appeared in 19 towns where the company had plans which ads were said to be blatantly partisan.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.553" offset="853556">The ad in question only one which was attached to the complaint appears at A16 of the record and also reproduced at the end of the petitioner's brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.155" offset="907995">There was also a second count under which pending jurisdiction was asserted based on an assertion of ultra vires and illegality under Delaware law.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.020" offset="951463">Going back again to the same element of expenditure of corporate funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.547" offset="969540">Injunctive relief including the corrective advertising to be placed at the expense of the individual defendants, compensatory in punitive damages as well as Attorney's fees and cause were sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.166" offset="1020008">A temporary restraining order was sought which appears at page 17 of the record in which there was sought a prohibition against Bethlehem Steel Corporation from purchasing or paying for advertising, identical to or substantially similar to Exhibit A, that was refused and thereafter there was an application made for preliminary injunctive relief and I would invite and request Your Honors attention to the language of the prayer for preliminary injunction which appears 826 of the record because there the plaintiff sort to prohibit the individual defendants from causing Bethlehem to purchase or pay for any advertising in connection with any federal election.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.957" offset="1215195">Including but not limited to advertisement, identical or substantially similar to Exhibit A.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.408" offset="1237034">Prohibiting Bethlehem from purchasing or paying for any advertising in connects with any federal election including but not limited to advertisements identical to or substantially similar to Exhibit A.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.095" offset="1283741">Directing Bethlehem Steel to cancel all advertising previously ordered in connection with any federal election including but not limited to advertisements identical to or substantially similar to Exhibit A.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="306.958" offset="1331179">Mr. Rome, the Court of Appeals didn't in its opinion necessarily approve that form of relief, did it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_p_rome" startTime="314.006" stopTime="353.898">
            <label>Mr. Edwin P. Rome</label>
            <text syncTime="314.006" offset="1359391">I believe sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.958" offset="1363153">The necessary consequence of the majority opinion is indeed not only to approve the form of relief but in actuality to sanction injunctive relief as a preferred remedy contrasting with the criminal remedy set out in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.958" offset="1435251">And this thereby in our contention Mr. Justice Rehnquist, at once creating an entire problem of prior restraint because my purpose in reading this language to the Court is to show that there was in actuality, a prior restraint not only of the particular ad but indeed of ad that had not yet been prepared or published.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="353.898" stopTime="356.556">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="353.898" offset="1518947">Well, didn't the respondent seek damages also?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_p_rome" startTime="356.556" stopTime="1015.258">
            <label>Mr. Edwin P. Rome</label>
            <text syncTime="356.556" offset="1529605">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.852" offset="1534830">Damages both compensatory and punitive were sought and the majority of the Court of Appeals below held that there was an implied rate of action on behalf not only of stockholders but also on behalf of all voters as a result of which in our submission there is an unparalleled implication of a private right of action in this case going far beyond anything which to our knowledge has ever occurred before.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.446" offset="1657187">Most particularly, the majority paneled below concluded that it was not bound by this Court's decision in Amtrak but turned rather to Borak and although it held under Borak that the implication of a private remedy was appropriate to use Chief Judge Seitz words.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.400" offset="1744959">He went on to conclude that it was appropriate for a variety of reasons including the availability of a more expeditious remedy, including the possibility of some sort of partisanship on the part of governmental authorities charged with the enforcement of the Act and also because it was appropriate and necessary to carry out the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.077" offset="1847672">Judge Aldisert dissented based upon this Court's ruling in Amtrak saying indeed that the majority had defied this Court's ruling in Amtrak.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.978" offset="1895320">The trial judge who was reversed by the majority panel had concluded on the basis of the advertising which was presented to him that there was not an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.385" offset="1948923">That 610 had to be narrowly construed in order to avoid a constitutional infringement of the First Amendment and that as so construed the expenditures here involved did not come within active electioneering which would come within the prohibition of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.798" offset="2030529">And he also said that to enjoin the expenditures here would raise the gravest constitutional issues under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.189" offset="2072116">Following the reversal, there was -- following the grant of denial of the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.548" offset="2105553">There was an appeal to the Third Circuit which affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.051" offset="2127600">Thereafter, there was an application for security for expenses below as the result of which the state pendent jurisdiction count was dropped out by my friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.119" offset="2171800">And thereafter, there was a motion for summary judgment filed before Judge Troutman, on the basis of the fact that there is no implied private right action under 610.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.153" offset="2212028">That 610 is inapplicable as a matter of law and that 610 is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.127" offset="2239927">There was a motion for evidentiary hearing which was denied because Judge Troutman found that on the basis of the language of the Act on the basis of the congressional history and the purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.291" offset="2296560">There was no implied right of action and he could rule that as a matter of law and summary judgment was then granted without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.534" offset="2329475">I would urge Your Honors to examine the material that was published by Bethlehem admittedly which is attached to the brief and in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.778" offset="2370435">In our submission, an examination of that material was showed that it is not to be identified with any anti-social conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.003" offset="2403349">This kind of political speech, we submit, ought not to be characterized as a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.351" offset="2424769">It cannot be said to come from a corrupt or corrupting source.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.899" offset="2442951">As a matter of fact, in our urgent submission to this Court, it comes within the language of Justice Reed and the CIO case if the earlier Provision 313 were construed to prohibit the publication by corporations in the regular cause of conducting their affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.454" offset="2513168">A periodical's advising their members, stockholders, and customers of danger or advantage to their interest from the adoption of measures or the election to offices of men espousing such measures, the gravest doubt would arise in our minds as to its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.748" offset="2582340">In our contention here, the advertising the material that is before the Court represents nonpartisans sponsorship of issue oriented advertising, contrary to the viewed taking by Chief Judge Seitz for the majority below.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.007" offset="2643362">We say there are an abundance of countervailing reasons why this Court should not conclude that the implication of a private right of action is necessary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.695" offset="2690173">As Your Honors are aware, the Government has far than amicus brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.365" offset="2708877">It has not contended that the implication of a private right of action is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.871" offset="2734895">Its here simply to support the constitutionality of Section 610, as a matter of fact the implication of a private right of action in our view would come within the bond suggested by the Nashville Milk case that such private right of action is subjected to great potential abuse because here we have as the result of the opinion by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.674" offset="2826115">An ability on the part of the all of the voters of the United States, all of the stockholders of corporations to bring actions for injunctive relief and damages and what this would mean by way of an engulfment of the Court's throughout the country is plain to be seen because it lends itself to the possibility of conflicting judgments coming out of different courts on the same ads, a multitude of litigation coming through out the country, ultimately coming to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.322" offset="2944711">Moreover, it is admitted in this case that there is nothing in the con -- the congressional history of the litigation which shows any intention on the part of the Congress to imply a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.891" offset="2998941">On the contrary as Your Honors are aware, this is legislation which has for over 50 years evoked the continuing repeated concern and attention of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.969" offset="3047215">It has been as Your Honors are aware recently amended not only in 71 but also in 74 and then our view, one of the countervailing reasons that militate against the implication of a private remedy is the fact that in the Amendment of 1974, although there was an Amendment which created a private right of action under Title 3 of the Act, there was no change by the Congress of that which appears in Title 2 of the Act and this comes within what Mr. Justice Stewart wrote in Amtrak with regard to the application of exclusio unius.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.362" offset="3192769">In addition, there is nothing in the language of the Act itself which speaks or hints in terms of the implication of the private right of action and as a matter of fact, this legislation shows a carefully devised program elaborated by the Congress which now has set up a Federal Election Commission as the result of which there are procedures of available for remedies including criminal remedies as well as specific civil remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.237" offset="3312306">Under Mr. Justice Brennan's reference to the cross light in the Pipefitters case, we say that this kind of cross light is capable of being brought to bear upon Section 610 as the result of which it ought not to be held to imply a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.360" offset="3384822">In addition, normal principles of statutory construction, we suggest dictate the denial of the private right of action because there has to the best of our research and knowledge Your Honors, never had been a situation in which there has been the suggested implication of a private right of action which at once runs counter to First Amendment rights of the defendants, the petitioners here and carries with it inevitably, inescapably the possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.605" offset="3521808">The inevitability of prior restraint because I repeat, Chief Judge Seitz for the majority below literarily said that there was a much more expeditious remedy to be found particularly in the form of injunctive relief by the implication of a private right of action and how that could occur or come about without necessarily at ones leading to a prior restraint as its evidence by the nature of the language of the motion for preliminary injunction that was originally sort here is something that really belies reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.167" offset="3672064">Now in addition to that, we have the situation that the rules laid down by this Court particularly in areas that impinge or intrude upon First Amendment rights call for a narrow construction, a restrictive construction in order to avoid or save the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.970" offset="3759208">But on the contrary, that which the Court below has done has been to produce the most expanded kind of interpretation of expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.298" offset="3804557">Your Honors we'll recall that the rational back of the congressional legislation had to do with the thought of undue influence emanating from aggressions of wealth whether by corporations or unions, and a desire to protect the minority interest within corporations or labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.908" offset="3883029">The reality of it is that the Expenditure Clause in 610 as interpreted by 591 which the court below did runs in the face of that kind of understanding for the reason that the interpretation means that the expenditure of one dollar even though, it had the consent unanimous consent of the stockholders or of members of a labor union would nevertheless come within the band of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.089" offset="4015731">Moreover, our contention is that the ads on their face, the ad, the speech, the folder cannot be construed as representing active electioneering.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.293" offset="4064528">They cannot be held because they do not mention the name of a single candidate nor that they mention the name of a political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.850" offset="4098800">They cannot be held therefore to come within the language that Mr. Justice Frankfurter used in the UAW case as something that was intended to influence the public at large to vote for a particular candidate or a particular party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.367" offset="6616795">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.628" offset="6637902">May I first answer Mr. Justice Stewart's question to respondent, to petitioner's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.784" offset="6666533">It is true sir that the new Act uses the phrase “primary jurisdiction” and that is going to be a keystone of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.683" offset="6702059">To the extent of which the new Act sheds any light cross or cross-eyed on this problem, it is in favor of the position which I advocate here today because as the Joint Committee Conference Report says and I've quoted it on page 35 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.190" offset="6784084">This was for the purpose of assuring that private citizens would exhaust their administrative remedies and as Congressman Bradimus (ph) put it first, which means of course, as a precondition to bringing a private right of action or cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.160" offset="6860048">Now, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.686" offset="6874154">I disagree with my friend's characterization of what the lower court did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.335" offset="6900694">The petitioner's argument proceeded it seemed to me as though the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff below respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.242" offset="6960358">It did no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.476" offset="6969240">The Court of and may I say on the constitutional point as a footnote, the district judge never even mention the constitutionality much less passed on it or addressed the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.743" offset="7026395">The Court of Appeals did not address the constitutional question so that there is before this Honorable Court now a decision which merely set remands the case to the trial court for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.158" offset="7095986">There's not only is there an insufficient record with respect to the constitutional question, there's no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.188" offset="7132139">May I further point out Your Honors that the posture of a case is extremely significant in addition to what I have just said, “My friend has correctly told you that the complaint averred a plan on the part of the defendants, Bethlehem Steel Corporation and its directors to use the vast resources of that corporation for the specific partisan political purpose of influencing the 1972 election for one of the candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.515" offset="7289396">That's what the complaint alleged and it said, using the good old lawyer's English inter alia, the actions taken pursuant to the plan included the ad which the petitioner have referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.042" offset="7355538">That ad was widely published throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.831" offset="7374660">Pamphlets of Mr. Cort's speech, pamphlets were distributed and reprints of the speech were very widely distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.290" offset="7412485">It happens therefore, that because of the motion for preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.524" offset="7437458">We have not only the averments of the complaint but we also have admissions by the defendants of certain facts included within which are these publications which I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.192" offset="7504123">But I would put before Your Honors, the issue as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.256" offset="7520423">The first question is whether or not the complaint states a valid cause of action for violation of Section 610 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.454" offset="7573191">Secondly, whether the facts averting the complaint and already admitted make out a prima facie of a violation of Section 610; and thirdly, if Your Honor agrees -- if Your Honors agree with me on those first two questions, whether the Act Section 610 is unconstitutional facially or as applied by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.532" offset="7689488">Your Honor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist was entirely correct in observing that the court below did not grant any relief nor did it emanate that whatever kind of relief that was requested by the plaintiffs in the District Court whether by way of injunction or otherwise was proper and correct and should be granted, all it said was let the matter go back to Judge Troutman for a full trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.449" offset="13193174">In Amtrak, you did not have a statute which provided for recognized standards of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.446" offset="13221177">You had a completely new scheme, a concept for running a written -- a National Rail -- Passenger Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.239" offset="13256286">Now, in that context, not only with it not effectuate the purposes of the statute to give passengers the right to get discontinuances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.529" offset="13297455">It would have defeated the purposes of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.937" offset="13363075">That is the reason why Amtrak falls outside of the line of cases without different from them, without overruling them, and why it is consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.578" offset="13405706">It's just totally distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.289" offset="13416573">Finally, I suggest that the case on its face, the statute on its face is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.358" offset="13444786">There is no restriction contrary to what Mr. Rome said on any free speech whether be the corporation and in our brief, we have pointed out how very carefully this statute was drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.572" offset="13917706">With Your Honors' permission, I would bring to your attention the fact that Judge Aldisert had earlier commented in the same way that Mr. Justice Stewart has suggested to imply a private right of action here he says, is to suggest that for every written volume of Title 18 United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.861" offset="13994820">There is an unwritten volume of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.002" offset="14007359">In actuality, contrary to what Mr. Berger has said, the congressional history of this legislation shows that the Chairman of the House Conferees, Mr. Hay and this appears on page 32 and 33 of our brief, pointed out that there was an intention to assure that civil suits are not misuse in a partisan manner and that the complex and sensitive rights and duties stated in the Act are administered expertly and uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.144" offset="14127940">And therefore, the private civil action was created via the Commission under Title 3 but not in Title 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.430" offset="14157093">In actuality also, I urge upon Your Honors the recognition that what has been the heart of this case from the beginning has been, the speech, the ad, and the folder and that alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.883" offset="14214875">There has been no doubt or dispute about that even to the point that my friends on the other side sought to have the Third Circuit rule as a matter of law on summary judgment that those documents in and of themselves constituted a violation.</text>
