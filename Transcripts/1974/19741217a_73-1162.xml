            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="34.510" offset="241455">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.812" offset="254621">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review the judgment of that Court, reversing the convictions of respondents Wilson and Bryan for criminal contempt of Court in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.130" offset="319927">Each was provisionally sentenced to serve six months in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.027" offset="335496">The question presented is whether a trial witness who refuses to obey a court order to testify may be held in criminal contempt pursuant to the summary procedures of Rule 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure rather than the notice and hearing requirements of Rule 42 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="77.690" offset="414177">Our primary submission is that the District Courts have the authority and the discretion to use summary contempt proceedings in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.516" offset="453465">We also contend that in any event, in the particular facts of this case, summary contempt procedures were properly used.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.033" offset="491499">The respondents Wilson and Bryan both refused to obey the orders of the District Court that they testify at the trial of one Robert Anderson on charges involving two bank robberies: one of them, the Nanuet Bank and, the other, the Empire Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.529" offset="557537">Prior to the trial, Bryan had been indicted for robbery and assault with dangerous weapon concerning the Nanuet robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.592" offset="593690">Wilson had been similarly indicted concerning the Empire robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.736" offset="614275">Bryan had plead guilty to the assault charge and Wilson to the robbery charges against him and in both cases, the other charges were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.862" offset="650846">Now shortly before the Anderson trial was to begin, Bryan had been sentenced by Judge Cooper pursuant to 18 U.S. Code 4208 (b) which provides for a study of the defendants and re-sentencing after a period of three months but which requires initially that the maximum sentence be imposed, in this case, 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.196" offset="748126">Before the trial began, Judge Lasker, who was assigned the Anderson case, had been told that it would probably take about two-and-a half days.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.107" offset="791803">In the course of the trial, eventually, Bryan was called as a government witness to testify concerning the Nanuet robbery and Wilson was called to testify concerning the Empire robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.714" offset="842271">At this time, both were incarcerated, Bryan on his sentence on the assault conviction, Wilson awaiting sentence on his robbery conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.880" offset="878843">There is a common pattern of events concerning both contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.477" offset="897233">First, all proceedings occurred in open court with the jury absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.735" offset="918340">Each one was asked questions by the prosecutor concerning Anderson and the respective robberies beginning with did they know Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.395" offset="957001">They refused to answer any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.886" offset="966928">The District Court granted them immunity pursuant to 18 U.S. Code 6003 and explained the consequences of that grant of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.367" offset="1000887">He said that he would hold them in contempt if they refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.776" offset="1018441">Each again, refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.603" offset="1025755">The district judge directed them to answer and said he would hold them in contempt if they refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.763" offset="1046444">They again refused and he held them in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.596" offset="1061804">Now, the court had already received arguments for-- from the attorneys for Wilson and Bryan as to their grounds for refusing to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.039" offset="1095555">At this time, the court heard additional argument concerning the sentencing of both Wilson and Bryan, what alternatives the court could consider and what their motivations and the reasoning might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.803" offset="1150621">Wilson's attorney specifically acknowledged that his motivation was to save a friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.581" offset="1173713">The Court then gave Wilson and Bryan each the opportunity to be heard, and each declined to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.251" offset="1204328">Judge Lasker then sentenced each of them to six months at this time, as he put it, but he made it clear that this was a provisional sentence subject to revision and that he would consider an application for reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.167" offset="1256051">He made it consecutive to the sentences they were or would be serving for their other convictions in order to give the sentence reality and said, otherwise, there would be no point to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.287" offset="1300564">And, he specifically noted in sentencing Bryan, who was the first of the two to be sentenced, that a purpose of the sentence was to persuade Bryan to change his mind and to testify, and he said he would reduce the sentence to nothing if he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.348" offset="1364720">Later the same day, both sides rested the case against Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.134" offset="1391888">There are certain facts, before I go into the consequences of their refusals that are peculiar to each of the respondents and I'll note them briefly, although we don't believe that they are material to the central question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.284" offset="1452492">Though he had notice of the government's intention to call Bryan as a witness, Bryan's original attorney had been unable to attend the Anderson trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.560" offset="1489586">He did submit a document setting forth some arguments as to why he thought Bryan should not be required to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.282" offset="1520515">At the court's request, Wilson's attorney who was in court prepared to address a similar problem concerning Wilson agreed to represent Bryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.143" offset="1559907">Now, in the course of the proceedings against Bryan, it had been argued that one reason they declined to testify was a fear that it might affect their sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.690" offset="1598151">In Bryan's case, his eventual re-sentencing by Judge Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.763" offset="1618422">Now, this is a baseless fear in this case because, in pleading guilty and in discussing the case with the probation officer in connection with the pre-sentence investigation, they had already been required to make and did make admissions concerning their involvement, although, in the course of that, Wilson declined to identify his accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.749" offset="1726360">In any event, in order to avoid any basis for such a claim of possible effect on sentencing in Wilson' case, Judge Lasker decided that he would try to sentence him then, before he testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.732" offset="1786337">The court heard the probation officer report on what he would have included in his pre-sentence investigation report which included an admission of Wilson's involvement in the robbery, and also heard a presentation by Wilson's attorney as to Wilson's background, his family problems, and the substance of a report by a doctor in which the doctor referred to Wilson as having an adolescent loyalty to defendant Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.243" offset="1904306">Now, in making this effort to sentence to Wilson the judge stressed that he thought that a delay in Anderson's trial and others scheduled to follow it was undesirable and he noted particularly the fact that Anderson was in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.313" offset="1972642">Finally, however, Judge Lasker concluded that he would be -- he'd rather defer the sentencing of Wilson who was after all facing a potential sentence of 20 years on a very serious charge and, at a later time, he sentenced him to treatment under the Youth Corrections Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.070" offset="2047666">Neither Wilson nor Bryan took advantage of the opportunity to reconsider their refusal and to testify, although it was admittedly a limited opportunity of several hours that day before the Government rested its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.112" offset="2107852">As a direct result of their disobedience of the court orders that they testify, the administration of justice was seriously obstructed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.192" offset="2148185">Acknowledging that the government's case against Anderson concerning the Nanuet robbery had been substantially weakened by Bryan's refusal to testify, Judge Lasker granted Anderson's motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.083" offset="2215685">That case was irrevocably lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.389" offset="2228955">As to the Nanu -- as to the Empire robbery, Judge Lasker noted that while Wilson's testimony was not as perhaps essential in the sense that it was prima facie case sufficient to send the case to the jury, it was not cumulative either.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.905" offset="2303039">So, the case went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.263" offset="2308472">The jury disagreed and, as a result of the hung jury, there had to be a second trial with consequent cost and judicial and other resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.543" offset="2353507">At that second trial, as it turned out, Anderson was convicted concerning the Empire robbery, but one can safely assume that if Wilson had testified at the first trial, we might never have had a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.876" offset="2422888">On appeals by Wilson and Bryan, the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.741" offset="2446294">It held, first, that neither one of them had any legal basis for refusing to testify once they had been granted immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.798" offset="2478582">The Court noted in passing that if they had been simply concerned about the effect of their testimony on sentencing there were other and better remedies to deal with that problem, such as sealing the transcript or asking that they'd be sentenced by a different judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.657" offset="2549948">Their remedy of refusing to obey the court's order to testify, the Court of Appeals said was wholly improper approach to that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.104" offset="2607835">The ground for the reversal of the convictions was that the Court of Appeals concluded that the use of summary procedure of Rule 42 (a) is improper in a case of an orderly refusal of a witness to comply with the court order that they testify even if the witness is represented by counsel and even if the witness has an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.829" offset="2702712">The court felt hat this result was compelled by its decision in an earlier case, the Marra case, in which it had said that if it were looking at the question on a clean slate, it would uphold the use of summary procedure in those circumstances, but it felt disabled to do so by what it thought was the teaching of this Court's decision in Harris against the United States, to which I'll return shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.137" offset="2815875">As we note in our brief at page 23, other Courts of Appeals have sustained convictions pursuant to Rule 42 (a) in similar circumstances and have disagreed, in effect, with the Second Circuit's analysis in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.939" offset="2919111">Now, criminal contempt comprehends a spectrum of offenses in varied types and degrees of seriousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.006" offset="2963414">It's therefore important to focus precisely on the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.061" offset="2983581">This case presents no claim of abuse of the summary contempt to power by a judge embroiled in a heated controversy with a witness or a party or an attorney, nor is there any claim of a right to a jury trial with the sentence in this case, the maximum sentence here being six months, nor do we have here a staged recreation in the presence of the court of a contempt that was actually or originally committed elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.099" offset="3099773">The question here is simply whether a so-called respectful refusal of a witness to obey a court's order to testify or to give evidence at trial can be punished summarily as a criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.261" offset="3164453">Well --</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="765.432" stopTime="769.399">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="765.432" offset="3165080">Mr. Norton, was there any formal objection to use of a summary procedure?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gerald_p_norton" startTime="769.399" stopTime="1281.153">
            <label>Mr. Gerald P. Norton</label>
            <text syncTime="769.399" offset="3180962">There was not, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.566" offset="3193605">Before the Court had granted immunity to the witnesses, there was a passing comment by Wilson's attorney to the fact that she wanted more time to consider or research the privilege questions which they were then discussing, but that issue evaporated from the case once the Court granted the witnesses' immunity and there was no objection raised to the summary procedure as to either witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.921" offset="3327039">Now, the question this Court has not previously directly resolved the question in this case, although it did in dictum in the Yates case, approved the procedure that was followed by Judge Lasker here.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.181" offset="3380120">Now, 18 U.S. Code 401 authorizes federal courts to punish by imprisonment various contempts, one of which is disobedience of its lawful orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.554" offset="3429543">It's not disputed here that the refusals of Wilson and Bryan to obey Judge Lasker's order that they testify constitutes criminal contempt punishable under 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.383" offset="3480952">Incidentally, I should note that although the District Court docket entries recite conviction under 18-402, it's clear that the Court intended and the parties here have understood that it was a conviction under 18-401 and Section 402 is, by its terms, plainly inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.451" offset="3561200">Now, that a refusal to testify may be punishable under these circumstances, under -- as criminal contempt is more than clear from this Court's decision in Harris and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.387" offset="3612923">It's also clear that disobedience of a Court order to testify is a serious type of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.467" offset="3637269">This Court said in the Shillitani case that the power of a Court to compel a witness to testify is essential to the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.577" offset="3673631">In Calandra it noted that every citizen owes his government the basic obligation to testify when so ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.836" offset="3706755">Now, the reason that the public has a right to every man's evidence, as the Court said in the Nixon case, is that the integrity of the judicial system depends upon full disclosure so that innocent persons do not suffer, nor the guilty escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.855" offset="3778748">It's important to note in this regard that the principle we contend for here is inherently neutral in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.640" offset="3805915">It does not necessarily favor the prosecution, although in this case it might.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.197" offset="3824201">The same question would arise if a defense witness refused to testify when ordered to do so by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.302" offset="3856593">In such circumstances, the consequence of recalcitrant might not be limited to the extended incarceration of a defendant but rather, it could result in the conviction of an innocent person.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.391" offset="3920959">Now, the central issue here is whether the summary procedures of Rule 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were properly used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.381" offset="3960874">The case is squarely within the terms of Rule 42 (a), in that, Judge Lasker saw and heard the contemptuous conduct and it occurred in the actual presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.122" offset="4007894">Moreover, summary disposition of -- in this case is consistent with the purpose of Rule 42 in distinguishing between those contempts which should be subject to the notice and hearing requirements of Rule 42 (b) and those covered by 42 (a) where summary disposition is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.226" offset="4092322">The use of the summary contempt power is justified in part by the fact that contemptuous conduct often disrupts ongoing proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.838" offset="4126699">There is therefore a need for a swift adjudication of whether the conduct is justified and lawful and whether it should be punished so as to end the disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.630" offset="4169853">The need for dispatch is perhaps or is especially great with the recalcitrant witness, the trial witness in a criminal case, particularly a jury trial, whether it's a prosecution witness or a defense witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.153" offset="4227950">A defendant has a right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.384" offset="4236936">The Court's prosecutors have obligations to proceed promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.880" offset="4254908">The defendant may well be incarcerated so that any delay in the trial for a cite excursion on the contempt proceedings or, as in this case, for a retrial because of a hung jury puts a penalty on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.096" offset="4319796">If the defendant is ultimately acquitted, there is no way to recoup that lost liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.899" offset="4342993">Also, where a jury trial is involved, a suspension of the proceedings to comply with the notice and hearing requirements of 42 (b) creates additional difficulties and expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.062" offset="4399626">Now, where the contempt consists of the refusal in the Court's presence to obey in order to give evidence at trial, there is no real need for a formal hearing required by 42 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.581" offset="4449677">The primary purpose of which is to gain facts and to resolve factual disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.801" offset="4470575">The essential facts are known to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.969" offset="4479248">In many such cases, as here, the reasons for the contempt will also be known by the circumstances leading up to the original refusal to give evidence and the order to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.283" offset="4532537">If there are relevant facts which are not known to the judge or other matters that might bear on whether the defendant should -- or the witness should be held in contempt or the question of sentencing, they can be brought to the Court's attention afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.979" offset="4591261">As the Court noted in Groppi, and again in Taylor against Hayes, Courts commonly modify contempt judgments on the basis of subsequent presentations or developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.800" offset="4634624">In this case, Wilson and Bryan had more than Rule 42 (a) would entitle them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.749" offset="4662418">They had opportunities to explain their position before they were ordered to testify and before and after they were held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.288" offset="4692511">They had counsel to advice and assist them and they had the substance of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.493" offset="4721351">Moreover, since conviction, neither one has made any effort to make any presentation to the District Court of any matter that might have warned them whether they should be held in contempt or whether the provisional six-month sentence was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.995" offset="4787388">They have not sought any kind of reconsideration or additional hearing or tendered any matters of any kind beyond offering speculations as to what might have happened had there been a fuller hearing than they in fact had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.402" offset="4856978">Indeed, in cases that are indisputably subject to the summary contempt power, there is likely to be a greater basis for speculating that, a hearing might have been useful in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.237" offset="4900342">There has been no prior opportunity as here, to make some explanation of why you're doing what you're doing and in many of those cases, the conduct where the witness or defendant throws a chair or some power is abusive to the Court, there is a greater reason for thinking that there is some background causative factor that deserves some further exploration, yet summary contempt is properly upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.998" offset="5015385">And if the mere speculative possibility of some kind of extenuating circumstances were to be accepted as sufficient reason to -- not to use summary contempt, there might never be a case where a Court could safely exercise a power that all concede it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.200" offset="5096155">Now, the summary imposition of the contempt in this case is consistent with the propositions that the Court should, in the contempt area, use the least power adequate to the needs of the occasion and should resort to criminal contempt only if civil contempt would not be efficacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.522" offset="5165432">As Judge Lasker knew, civil contempt in this case could be effective only for a brief period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.902" offset="5191032">There were only a matter of hours remaining in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.261" offset="5204407">One could reasonably assume that Wilson and Bryan would be willing to spend those hours to save a friend.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.621" offset="5353827">As Judge Lasker recognized in making the contempt sentences run consecutive to their sentences on their convictions, this he could not do with civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.603" offset="5397817">Now, in a case where civil contempt might be appropriate because there's a sufficiently long period of confinement, a grand jury witness would be a good example and the witness is already incarcerated, you might have a different situation because in some such cases, at least if it was a prisoner serving an adult sentence imposed by the same Court, it might be possible for the District Court to suspend the execution of that ongoing sentence for the period of the confinement on civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.902" offset="5530937">This is a novel approach, recently sustained by the D.C. Circuit in the Liddy case and by the Seventh Circuit in Anglin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.664" offset="5566046">However, this was not an option that was a feasible one in this case because there were only a couple of hours left in the last day of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.197" offset="5608155">On the other hand, the deferral of contempt proceedings required by 42 (b) is not entirely satisfactory here either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.525" offset="5637517">That approach tends to forgo the opportunity to coerce compliance during the period when it might be meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.480" offset="5665311">It's almost totally punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.136" offset="5671894">Now, Judge Lasker recognized here that summary imposition of criminal contempt had a possibility of coercing these people to change their minds and testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.262" offset="5720377">They had to face the likelihood, not only that if they had not been in jail they would have to serve some time, but if they didn't purge their contempt they would have to serve whatever full sentence was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.623" offset="5769906">Let me turn now to the question whether the District Court's approach in this case was foreclosed by this Court's decision in Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.054" offset="5803551">The question presented in Harris was whether a grand jury witness who disobeyed a court order to testify was properly held in criminal contempt pursuant to the summary procedures of 42 (a) where the original refusal occurred in the grand jury room, out of the presence of the Court, and it was recreated in the presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.594" offset="5889755">Now, also unlike this case, the witness had unsuccessfully requested an adjournment opportunity to present witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.082" offset="5919744">In a 5-4 decision reversing its earlier decision in the Brown case, this Court held that, although the refusal constituted criminal contempt, it should have been proceeded against under the notice and hearing requirements of Rule 42 (b) since the real contempt was not in the presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.484" offset="6005321">In dicta relied upon by respondents in the Court of Appeals, the majority indicated that Rule 42 (a) was reserved for exceptional cases involving misbehavior of various sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.566" offset="6049625">Even so, the Court indicated that it was not holding 42 (a) inapplicable to a case like this because it's expressly assumed that 42 (a) may at times apply to testimonial episodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.161" offset="6104064">And we've addressed in our brief the historical argument as to whether summary contempt power can ever be applied to disobedience of Court orders as distinguished from misbehavior, and I will not address that further here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.362" offset="6156831">Note simply that a witness' refusal to obey a Court order to testify or to give evidence is likely to create, as here, a far greater obstruction of Court proceedings than many of the mis -- types of misbehavior for which summary contempt power is unquestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.877" offset="6238856">Now, the contempt in Harris involved a grand jury witness and here we have witnesses at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.127" offset="6259858">There's far a greater need for speedy action at a trial because a grand jury can last 18 months and more and civil contempt may be summarily imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.992" offset="6887320">First, that the contempt or -- forgive me, the refusal to testify at all times was orderly and respectful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.004" offset="6919398">The witness was called to testify before the same judge, this is respondent Wilson, was called to testify before the same judge who was to eventually sentence him on the underlying bank robbery charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.831" offset="7130676">Well, there may be some link but, I might add, that that precipitous summary action may well do more to infringe upon the authority and dignity of the Court than the short adjournment of perhaps 24 hours so that a hearing can be held to allow the accused, condemned, or an opportunity to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.380" offset="7220851">I mean, in answer to what I perceive to be Your Honor's concerns during the assistance argument, trials are frequently adjourned for short periods of time without the calamity befalling the system that the Government now suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.658" offset="7286053">Adjournments are granted in criminal trials for much less consequential reasons the point is that, in fact, adjudications of criminal contempt are not exempt from procedural due process and in this case, there was no reason, no valid reason for not affording respondent Wilson the opportunity to defend against the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.336" offset="7396707">Now, when the respondent refused to testify, he did so on the grounds that even the grant of immunity would not protect him from use of his testimony against him at the time of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.274" offset="7456475">I would like to point out at this juncture that there were other dama -- there were other -- there was other liability within the context of his testimony because had he testified, he would've been subject to cross-examination by defense counsel and it wasn't -- he was just not subject to liability as to the facts of this crime but there were other areas perhaps, and I don't suggest that they definitely exist here but there's a possibility that he would be subjected to greater liability by the cross-examination of defense counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.338" offset="10788760">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.860" offset="10798791">I think that the is suposed in this case is one that is fundamental to our system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.733" offset="10822301">That is, what rights, procedural rights do we give a citizen of this country before we sentence him to serve six months in jail?</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.584" offset="10857723">I think that the issue is muddied somewhat by the procedural context in which this case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.843" offset="10886771">And I think it drives to some of the questions that Justice Blackmun raised as to whether this is a due process requirement or rather a requirement of Rule 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.373" offset="10928880">It seems to me that the petition -- the respondents here were afforded a hearing, that was not a Rule 42 (a) hearing, but at the same time they were not given a 42 (b) hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.607" offset="10985827">And I would suggest, very respectfully that in determining whether or not summary contempt -- the summary contempt power may be used in the case of a witness who respectfully refuses to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.588" offset="11045700">We have to look at the summary contempt power as that is contemplated in ex parte Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.538" offset="11069524">Summary contempt power authorizes the district judge or the trial judge to impose a sentence of imprisonment without affording the respondent the right to counsel or the right to say anything in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.315" offset="11140681">And it seems to me that the consistent teaching of this Court is that that type of deviation from what we normally consider the due process rights of a criminal defendant can only justified by the most extraordinary need to protect the dignity of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.215" offset="11236185">And it seems to me that in this case that great need to protect the dignity of the Court is not present to justify a departure from the more traditional procedures which due process encompasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.283" offset="11296475">It seems to me, we have a case where these two men, for different reasons perhaps and in different circumstances, refused to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.874" offset="11338898">I think one of the compelling facts concerning the client I represent, Mr. Bryan, in this procedure, is that he was forced to go forward in the absence of his own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.392" offset="11388949">Counsel was simply assigned to him on that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.759" offset="11406399">That may not seem like a terribly significant fact, but it seems to me, my experience in representing assigned counsel -- representing assigned defendant is that the -- it takes some time for a lawyer assigned by the Court to develop a rapport with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.095" offset="11503783">The rapport that comes naturally if a man has sought you out to be his counsel does not exist when you are suddenly thrust upon the defendant and it seems to me that fact here takes away the ability of the counsel to on the spur of the moment really meaningfully advice the client of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.467" offset="11601272">And it seems to me, the issue here is whether or not these respondents should have had the right to counsel before being sentenced to the maximum sentence possible in these circumstances, a sentence of more than six months could not have been imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2902.090" offset="11711718">It certainly was, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'm suggesting is not that the punishment was not proper and, indeed, I think an argument could be made by the Government at some future time that in a situation like this, it might be appropriate to impanel a jury so that a more severe sentence could be imposed, but that has to do with the punishment fitting the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.448" offset="11813177">What I'm suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, is that before that much of a penalty, the maximum penalty available is imposed that we have to afford a respondent in a contempt proceeding certain minimal due process guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.802" offset="11878588">A meaningful right to counsel and I suggest that the appointment of counsel that day was not a meaningful right to counsel as far as my client was concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.010" offset="12071372">I would think that, certainly a 24-hour period might have been reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.180" offset="12092061">I think that you have here a situation, also, I disagree with the Government that this procedure is the most effective way as they suggest, is the most effective way to get the -- a testimony that you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.060" offset="12147649">It seems to me, once the sentence is imposed -- well, that's where I've got to serve and I deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.250" offset="12176384">A witness who is confronted with a situation where he is told that, “I am sentencing you, I'm ordering the marshal to take you into custody and hold you in civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.590" offset="12221733">I'm going to set this matter down for a hearing I have to determine if you should be held in criminal contempt and a sentence to be imposed will be fixed at that time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.345" offset="12264782">And a witness in that situation is more likely to come back the following day and say, “I've thought about it and I will testify” than one who has had the final sentence imposed on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.239" offset="12308355">So that, I don't think that the remedy that the government suggest is the most effective way to bring about the testimony that they seek to compel here, but it seems to me that the consistent teaching of this Court has been that summary contempt power is reserved for the very extreme case, and it is our submission here that this is not that extreme a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.852" offset="12430817">The -- there was no disrespect -- manifest for the Court that it called for the Court to vindicate its authority right then without waiting for a moment so that people would know that the Court's authority exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.867" offset="12490794">This is not the situation such as existed in Terry where there was a violent outburst in the courtroom and the Court there said, “Fine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.205" offset="12528201">There, the dignity of the Court is affronted and it must be able to control the procedures in its own courtroom, and that was I think the rationale set forth in Cooke versus United States lays out those distinctions quite clearly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3861.149" offset="15547956">-- the Chief Justice indicated, criminal contempts are frequently revised after further presentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.754" offset="15578363">On the question of notice, counsel seemed to assume that one day would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.657" offset="15594036">Now, whether that's so or not is an open question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.414" offset="15605008">Some Courts of Appeals have said that five-day's notice is required where notice is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.321" offset="15632697">A five-day interruption of the trial would be something very different indeed, in that it would be longer than the trial itself took.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.425" offset="15665089">The question of whether a sentence under 42 (a) is -- has any coercive effect I think it's clear that summary exercise of the contempt power is inherently coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.696" offset="15710124">That is why the Courts permitted to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.830" offset="15722663">It is to invest immediately some conduct which obstructs or casts in a bad light the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.269" offset="15760488">If the only purpose were punishment, 42 (b) would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.904" offset="15775013">It is the need to deal immediately that justifies the summary dispositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.908" offset="15794970">And finally, on the mens rea question, I note simply that, first, 401 does not require that the action be willful as 402 does and that, in this case, the defendant had entered his guilty plea with no suggestion that he was not competent to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.173" offset="15868113">The difficulties in sentencing a youthful offender on a 20-year maximum burglary count are very different indeed from determining whether he has legitimately refused to answer a question.</text>
