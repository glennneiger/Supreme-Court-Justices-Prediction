            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Bustin</label>
            <text syncTime="30.761" offset="227432">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.516" offset="242479">This case originates as in a direct appeal from the decision of a three-judge district court in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.249" offset="277379">During the early months of 1971, in the Columbus School District in Columbus, Ohio, several of the schools located in that district experienced a series of internal student disruptions and the type involving fighting among students, blocking of hallways and stairways, questions surrounding the setting of several fires in one of the school building.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.856" offset="403811">One of the schools had to be closed for a period of time trying to bring order back, open defiance of the type characterized when a principal was speaking to one of the assembled classes, one of the students got up and told the principal that they were all done listening to him that he would now listen to them and they were going to tell him how it was going to be run.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.510" offset="514466">From that pattern of internal disruption, there occurred a series of temporary suspensions from anywhere from five to ten days arising under a statute Section 3313.66 of the Ohio Revised Code, which allowed a principal to temporarily suspend for a period of one to ten days without holding a formal hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.254" offset="637450">The statute required the principal or administrative official to send a notification to the parents and to the School Department of the fact that the suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.016" offset="696487">The statute also contained a provision which in the case of expulsion, required that the parents where expulsion was going to take place, could appeal that action to the Board of Education and the question of whether or not the child should be expelled would be heard by the Columbus Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.324" offset="789692">Following this pattern of temporary suspensions, a 1983 Civil Rights Action was instituted in which the section I've just discussed was challenged as being unconstitutional in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Due Process Clause and it was also alleged that it was vague and overbroad in its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.529" offset="902541">Following the conclusion of a trial, a three-judge district court concluded in its opinion that the statutory section and the regulations implementing the statute in the school were, in fact, unconstitutional as being violative of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.276" offset="993552">The court concluded that the statute was not vague or overbroad in its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.496" offset="1038378">In Ohio, in the structuring of the school system, the Ohio constitution directs that the legislature is to use public funds to establish a common system of schools and also gives the legislature power in the area of organization, administration and control of that particular school system that is set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.985" offset="1152376">In this particular statute, I mentioned is one of that series of statutory scheme which sets up and controls the common system of schools in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.559" offset="1210681">It's appellants position in this particular case in analyzing what's involved and in discussing the interest of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.612" offset="1250806">What’s really involved in this whole case is not really the temporary suspensions themselves, but really a question of what power the states and local school districts will have to structure their particular school systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.377" offset="1329904">And when I use the term “structure,” I mean, make decisions with respect to not only how the process will go on, who will be the teachers, how it will be managed and what form of academic discipline will be utilized in the particular system.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.487" offset="1406391">It’s our position that this is really the important question here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.576" offset="1438678">In Ohio, academic discipline is viewed by the Ohio courts anyway, as being part and parcel of the educational process, that has been so held in the Lauper (ph) case which is cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.518" offset="1530420">It's our position that the legislature in this particular case, given the type of area concerned that they were involved with, i.e., the educational process, wherein you're faced with entirely different types of interests that you find in other commons areas and I say that from this standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.046" offset="1636582">When you're trying to structure a school system, a very important question is, the type of relationship that the state and carry it down further, the local school districts would like to see established in their particular district.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.619" offset="1698858">I think the --</text>

            <text syncTime="403.142" offset="1716935">I mean, the type of relationship that will exist in the ongoing process between the teacher, a student and a principal, while the student is --</text>

            <text syncTime="410.966" offset="1748281">Members of the school board, for example, don't have anything directly to do with the students day by day, do they?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Bustin</label>
            <text syncTime="417.132" offset="1772941">Not on a day-by-day basis, but I think, this all works into the very process of formulating what type of academic discipline is going to take place in the particular school.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.870" offset="1843890">Viewed in that context, I think, the states must retain a certain degree of discretion, if you will, to decide for themselves, whether or not they will have academic discipline and what the form of that academic discipline will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.603" offset="1938766">It's our position that based on a much similar analogy as was contained in the Linwood case that a legislature that legislates as it has done in this particular case, which is in a restrictive sense, restricting the authority of the principal really, from having a -- what I would class as a carte blanche authority to discipline, cutting down his authority to a period of a one to ten days without requiring a hearing, while at the same time requiring one or utilizing one where a situation is in expulsion that a legislature does act within the framework of the type of discretionary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.319" offset="2121624">I think, this Court has talked about in repeated cases where it has been mentioned that local school authorities should retain a great deal of latitude and discretion in the daily management of their particular internal affairs of the school districts.</text>
