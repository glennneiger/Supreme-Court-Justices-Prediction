            <label>Mr. Ralph W. Parnell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="29.508" offset="221393">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.997" offset="239365">This is a cause which arose in the District Court in Louisiana as result of a statement that was made by one George Herman Rogers on March 23, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.437" offset="309164">At the time the statement was made, Mr. Rogers was in a Holiday Inn in Shreveport, Louisiana at approximately six o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.789" offset="362559">As result of the statement, Mr. Rogers was charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. (a) 871 (a) which reads as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.383" offset="412923">“Whoever knowingly and willfully deposits for conveyance in the mail or for delivery from any post office or by any letter carrier of any letter, paper, writing, print, missive, or document containing any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, the President elect, the Vice President or other officer next in order of succession to the Office of President of the United States or the Vice President elect or knowingly and willfully otherwise makes any such threat against the President, President elect, Vice President or other next officer in succession to the Office of President or Vice President shall be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned not more than five years above.”</text>
            <text syncTime="143.046" offset="675506">The statement or statements that Mr. Rogers has been charged to have made as I said were made at six o'clock in the morning, initially made in the presence of three waitresses at this particular Holiday Inn.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.331" offset="756694">The reaction of the three ladies that heard the statement, they're all describing as being odd, irrational, something wrong within.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.451" offset="817194">The statements that were charged in the indictment were taken out of context, they were taken out of a discussion that Mr. Rogers was trying to have with the three waitresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.690" offset="886157">Mr. Rogers had expressed to all three that he was very much upset about at the time President Nixon's trip to China.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.747" offset="926386">This event took place immediately after President Nixon's trip to China.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.427" offset="961076">Mr. Rogers in his comments said that he disagreed with President Nixon being in China, that the President was consorting with our enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.573" offset="1009664">He did not like the communist, he did not like the red Chinese, he was very upset with our President selling us out and for that he was going to Washington to beat his ass.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.017" offset="1075388">This in essence is what Mr. Rogers is charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.488" offset="1089285">He said these allegedly on five occasions, the words being the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.446" offset="1121155">In five occasions, three of them on that morning in the Holiday Inn resident dining room and that two were later to the police officers, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="273.737" offset="1198268">Was there something said about killing the President?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph W. Parnell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="276.350" offset="1208822">This was said I believe, Your Honor, to the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.709" offset="1226167">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.237" offset="1268276">Each time that Mr. Rogers tried to engage in a conversation or discussion of the political topic of the day which was President Nixon's trip to China.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.811" offset="1322611">He was rebuffed.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.606" offset="1337762">Nobody was really looking and listening to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.803" offset="1350614">One of the witnesses -- one of the gentlemen that heard the statement said that he was somewhat irritated by Mr. Rogers' disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.629" offset="1385932">He was disturbing, this man was a businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.500" offset="1397321">He was trying to get ready for his day's work and Mr. Rogers was disturbing him from thinking about his business of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.543" offset="1437550">All witnesses said that they initially thought that Mr. Rogers was intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.297" offset="1472554">One witness, one of the waitresses said that she smell the faint odor of alcohol on Mr. Rogers' breath.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.122" offset="1511842">She also said that in her conversation with Mr. Rogers, that it was raining and that she said that she wished that it would stop raining.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.237" offset="1556355">And at this point, Mr. Rogers informed her that he could make it stop raining.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.245" offset="1580387">And she said that she laughed at this and thought that maybe we have to leave that to higher power, and Mr. Rogers informed her that he was that higher power that he was Jesus Christ.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.099" offset="1643813">These statements taken in this context we feel like are not and cannot be prosecuted under the statute that I read under 18 U.S.C. (a) 871 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="405.605" offset="1725837">This statute is a good statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.105" offset="1743809">Certainly, the United States has a paramount right and duty to protect its highest officer, the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.170" offset="1792084">It would not -- if we do not protect our highest officer from a serious or true threat and we would certainly be jeopardizing not only his life but his enforcement or his duties or keying out his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.884" offset="1918934">The purpose of the statute or at least the history of it -- the legislative history of it indicates that in 1916, at the time the statute, was passed that the President was having some difficulty with written threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.633" offset="1989883">Mr. Webb in arguing for passage of the legislation stated that the written documents that the President was receiving was annoying to him, was irritating to him, was causing the President to trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.905" offset="2098970">So, they -- he said, “We need to enact this law to prevent people from writing to the President and threatening him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="514.542" offset="2161560">I do not believe that at the time this law was passed that the legislators intended for it to be carried as far as it's being carried today particularly to Mr. George Herman Rogers.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.855" offset="2246823">The law was passed in a tranquil period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.047" offset="2267512">It was first interpreted during World War I when the atmosphere of the country was somewhat storming.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.795" offset="2326549">The early cases are all very similar in the utterances which were prosecuted to the ones that Mr. George Herman Rogers made.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.758" offset="2382451">I truly believe that had those three men -- or had the people or the men in the early cases have they've been tried today that they certainly would not be convicted under the statute for the statements they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.094" offset="2443786">I think this -- their utterances towards President at the time Wilson in no way under today's interpretations of the law would be considered a true threat against the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.372" offset="2520900">This Court has expressed its views on threats or statements or utterances against the President of United States in only one occasion and that was in the case of Watts versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.904" offset="2591013">And in that case, this Court said that, first of all, there must be a true threat made before it can be threat against the President of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.916" offset="2643048">I believe that we we're here this morning to try to define what a true threat is.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.904" offset="2666977">I think that this Court must lay down now guidelines for the fact finders to determine what a true threat is within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.867" offset="2730820">The statute was passed to at that time what was I suppose a true threat against the country and that was that anybody the theory was that anybody that spoke out against the President or against the man in authority was in someway being disloyal to the United States, was trying to incite others to maybe carry out the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.017" offset="2859447">And we don't believe that under the First Amendment of the United States that this law can be applied to the facts before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.726" offset="2902288">The First Amendment --</text>

            <text syncTime="927.021" offset="3811453">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.500" offset="3829321">As counsel has indicated this is a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 871, threatening a life of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.497" offset="3873311">The arguments of counsel on appeal have been principally that the threats uttered were not true threats or that the trial court misconceived the statute or finally that if the trial court did not misconceived the statute, the statute as applied violated the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.611" offset="3973831">We disagree with all of these contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.553" offset="3985533">We believe that the threat was true threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.273" offset="3996505">We believe the trial court's instruction was correct and we believe that the statute as applied did not offend the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.811" offset="4030568">However, as the Court has raise in questions now, there are some procedural difficulties with this conviction which might justify this Court in reversing the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.029" offset="4079470">However, I would stress that these procedural problems have nothing to do with the facts of the case, the evidence before the jury, the instructions or the law on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.084" offset="4131715">In order to understand the facts of the case and the procedural problem that arose, I would like to elaborate in just a few words some of the facts of the circumstances and the evidence introduced at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.042" offset="4195558">I want to elaborate on that because I think it's important to realize that although for instance it is true that Mr. Rogers had a history of alcoholism, every witness testifying on the matter at trial with respect today in question testified that Mr. Rogers was not drunk at the time he made the statements in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.392" offset="4288972">Moreover, there was expert testimony at trial from a qualified psychiatrist as to the competence of Mr. Rogers at the time he made the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.192" offset="4332126">I'd also like to stress that the record is replete with threats to kill the President, to take the life of the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.410" offset="6180968">There are circumstances, Mr. Justice, which I haven't get to mention which include the fact that there is a question in this case as to whether the jury returned an unconditional verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.454" offset="6229138">Thus, we're not even absolutely sure that we have a fact finding by a jury that these were serious threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.877" offset="6262888">That is another considerations and addition to the ones I've already mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.176" offset="6284100">I would like to, if I may, turn to those particular circumstances because they color the question that the Court is asking and I think the Court should be aware of the circumstances which lead us to believe that the conviction in this case may in fact not have been an unqualified conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.936" offset="6367065">After the trial judge instructed the jury, we believe, correctly instructed the jury, the jury deliberated for two hours and then sent the trial judge a note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.979" offset="6415339">The note asked the Court whether the Court would accept a verdict of “guilty as charged with extreme mercy of the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.582" offset="6453687">Upon receiving that note, the trial court without consulting counsel instructed the marshal that the Court's answer was in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.109" offset="6487855">This note in the Court's answer appears at page 52 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.191" offset="6524113">Five minutes after receiving the Court's answer, the jury returned the verdict of guilty in the form I've just discussed, guilty as charged with extreme mercy of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.198" offset="6576149">Ordinarily, it would be the Government's view that a recommendation of mercy of this kind is mere surplusage could be discounted and would not affect the validity of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.153" offset="6620035">Here however, we have in addition to the form of the verdict the fact that it was arrived at by a unilateral communication from the District Court to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.246" offset="6668309">In our view, the jury's question about whether the Court would accept such a verdict was in effect a request for further instruction and we think that the proper instructions to be given under those circumstances would have been that the jury has no sentencing function that it must reach its verdict without consideration of the matter of sentence and that any recommendation it did make would not be binding upon the trial court at the time of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.476" offset="6801324">Moreover, we believe that before any response is made, counsel should be informed and counsel should be heard from.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.887" offset="6882931">I would assume so, Mr. Chief Justice, because if the jury is talking about mercy, he may feel that they are taking the possibility of punishment into the account to break a deadlock or to resolve a question in favor of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.572" offset="6945625">And that's why we think it's important that counsel should be heard from and we feel as a textural matter that a response without informing counsel arguably will in fact does deprive the defendant of the right to be present at every stage of the trial as is guaranteed by Rule 43 of he federal rules of criminal procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.934" offset="7163068">We pointed out in our original papers on the petition the form of the verdict as raising a question all by itself and suggested that arguably it was waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.422" offset="7901080">On the question of intent which is the central question in the case, the Court instructed the jury that a threat is a willful if the maker voluntarily and intentionally other's words is a declaration of an apparent intention to carry out the threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.288" offset="7964505">The Court also used the words and I'm leaving out a few words here that the defendant intentionally made the threat that a reasonable person would foresee would be interpreted as a serious expression of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.089" offset="8007764">The Court instructed the jury that actual intent to harm was not an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.695" offset="8034200">In our view, these are correct instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.990" offset="8047365">As we have seen the issue in this case, the issue particularly in the light of the verbal conflict amongst the Circuits given circulation by the Patillo decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.568" offset="8093654">The issue was whether the statute requires a subjective intent to harm the President or whether the statute prescribes words which objectively considered would appear to be serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.108" offset="8155826">Petitioner's reply brief, however, does not urge this distinction and does not urge that actual harm to the President ought to be an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.850" offset="8194800">Rather, they urged that the specific intent required has specific intent that the threat be communicated to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.796" offset="8226565">We don't think that either of these elements are in the statute either by congressional intention ought to construed as a matter of constitutional limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.518" offset="8261465">We begin with the words of the statute, the words “punishes a person who knowingly and willfully makes a threat to take a life favor and flick bodily harm upon the President of the United States”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.597" offset="8309739">The words “knowingly and willfully” these adverbs modify and refer to the act of making the threat and textually in any event do not require that the maker have an inward desire either to harm the President or to have the threat communicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.326" offset="8388629">We believe that the harm caused by a threat is caused by the mere utterance of the threat in circumstances where it would generally be considered serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.542" offset="8425514">If two persons are similarly situated then utter the same words which are apparently serious threats, the effect of these words are the same even if one of them harbors an inward desire to harm the President and the other does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.542" offset="8485491">Where a threat is objectively serious it can't be ignore and requires a responds from those charges with the protection of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.479" offset="8517256">In fact, it could endanger the President by diverting those resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.247" offset="8536377">If we -- we don't think that the sole purpose of the statute was to prevent harm to the President by convicting people who threaten to kill the President with an intention to carry it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.843" offset="8586742">The House Report on a 1916 Bill which became the law states the purpose of the President -- states the purpose of the statute as protecting the President from threats or violence which would restrain or coerce him in the performance of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.811" offset="8654660">That restraint or coercion to the extent that it occurs, occurs whenever the words are objectively serious and that restraint and coercion is neither augmented nor diminished by the subjective intent of the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.196" offset="8716204">Where the threat is apparently serious, the secret service has to investigate and to the extent that it is sidetracked by a bluff is diverted from the supremely serious business of defending and protecting the life of the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.182" offset="8784123">Our view that the term “willful” refers to the intent to make the threat rather than an intent to harm the President is we believe supported by the legislative debate on the Bill which became the law which is the predecessor to 871.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.168" offset="8860087">Among the things you will find in that legislative debate is a discussion of an example of an individual who finds a document containing a threat and mails it to someone as a matter of news.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.074" offset="8911705">Congressman Volstead urged that the word “willful” be retained in the statute in order to assure that such a person sending -- knowingly sending such words but not intending a threat would be beyond the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.124" offset="8975862">In our view, therefore, Congress' intent was to punish one who knowingly and intentionally makes a threat under circumstances which objectively viewed would be considered serious and sincere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.501" offset="9633416">Returning for the brief for moment to the First Amendment issue in the case which we do not consider a serious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.162" offset="9668002">It has long been clear that the First Amendment does not confer absolute protection for all utterances in all circumstances and at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.283" offset="9708544">Some words by their very utterance create an evil against which the legislature can act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.093" offset="9735711">A classic example and one that shows that the subjective intent of the maker is not always relevant to the consequences of speech is Justice Holmes's example of a man who falsely shots fire in the theater and causes a panic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.650" offset="9801958">This Court said the Chaplinsky case, there are certain well defined and narrowly limited classes of speech the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise serious constitutional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.317" offset="9852635">In our view, if there is any such class of speech, it includes true threats to kill the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.902" offset="9894954">A true threat is not advocacy, it's no part of the exposition of ideas, it doesn't seek to persuade and is not neutralized by a verbal response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.408" offset="9936959">It thus does not implicate the central policy of the First Amendment which is that speech can rebut speech and propaganda answer propaganda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.991" offset="9975306">A true threat is punishable because it creates an evil which Congress can prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.913" offset="9995055">As I've indicated, a threat demands a response from those charge with the President's protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.682" offset="10018147">It diverts the resources of that agency and the process tends to limit the President's activities or in the words of the House Report “restrain or coerce him in the exercise of his constitutional duties.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.676" offset="10074049">There is a perhaps another consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.161" offset="10092022">The federal laws concerning threats are not limited to threats against the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.255" offset="10116368">18 U.S.C. Section 875 and 876 for instance forbids the interstate communication in mailing of threats to do bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.126" offset="10167881">Threats of this kind and I would submit a fortiori threats to do bodily harm to or kill the President of the United States are punishable because of the anxiety, the fear, the turmoil and the potential for violence that they create whether or not they are heard by the intended victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.548" offset="10245517">Advocacy is wholly different in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.963" offset="10259205">Advocacy is protected by the Constitution even when it creates anger or resentment or uncertainty or unrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.410" offset="10293060">But threats are different in their consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.550" offset="10305599">Threats are different in the emotions they evoke and in the anxiety that they create.</text>
