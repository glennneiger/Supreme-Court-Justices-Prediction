            <text syncTime="31.318" offset="228603">This in forma pauperis case come to this Court on certiorari to the Missouri state court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.822" offset="258696">This is a state court post conviction proceeding in which the petitioner James Drope is challenging the life sentence imposed upon him in 1969 by the circuit court of the City of St. Louis for the somewhat bizarre and improbable crime of raping his own wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.087" offset="347721">There are two issues presented by our petition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.908" offset="367052">First is whether the petitioner was unconstitutionally denied his right to a psychiatric exam to determine his competency to proceed with his trial in accordance with this Court's decision of Pate v. Robinson, particularly in light of his mental history and his attempted suicide during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.340" offset="460779">The second question is whether he was unconstitutionally tried in absentia, following the suicide attempt which caused him to be hospitalized for surgery, and therefore, to miss remainder of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.658" offset="566000">It's our position that to state the facts of this case is to resolve the first issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.549" offset="597556">It's unnecessary I think to dwell upon the somewhat sordid details of the crime itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.354" offset="620753">It's suffice to say that the petitioner and four of his so called friends were charged with raping the petitioner's wife in January of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.190" offset="672162">The record is perfectly clear that first of all his wife thought that the petitioner was mentally ill and she signed a statement to the effect that she did not want to prosecute him and she thought he should have psychiatric care.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.646" offset="905906">Tired in the first place, yes Your Honor, but the only question here on the first point is whether there is a reasonable doubt under Pate against Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.743" offset="942373">Now, in addition to the wife's testimony, before the court at the time of the trial was a report of the psychiatrist which was made within a month of the transaction or the occurrence which was the subject of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.664" offset="1009977">Dr. Chuman was the psychiatrist who was seen by the petitioner at the suggestion of his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.060" offset="1047594">That report is reproduced in the appendix at pages 8 to 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.285" offset="1064521">I think its important to analyze what Dr. Chuman said.He examined the petitioner for an hour and a half and he found that the petitioner was markedly agitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.941" offset="1107153">He was suffering from marked anxiety.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.993" offset="1115303">He was having difficulty in talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.413" offset="1125021">He told the doctor that he heard voices from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.107" offset="1139754">He saw visions of dead people and he sometimes had conversations with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.852" offset="1158771">He had a difficult time relating.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.337" offset="1168697">He was circumstantial and irrelevant in his speech and he certainly needs the aid of a psychiatrist, said Dr. Chuman.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.323" offset="1200671">He was found to be very neurotic individual with Sociopathic personality, suffering from sexual perversion, borderline mental deficiency and chronic anxiety reaction with depression.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.638" offset="1285935">The this report was attached to a motion for continuance for the purpose of obtaining a psychiatric examination under Missouri Chapter 552.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.005" offset="1327417">However, when the case was assigned for trial, and I might add, the state of Missouri consented to that motion, consented to an exam, but when the case was assigned for trial, there was some misunderstanding about the trial date.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.203" offset="1380185">Petitioner's counsel indicated that he thought that the motion had been granted and the case was going to be continued to the September term.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.895" offset="1410905">However, it was on the docket in June, it was called and assigned to division, and when it was assigned, petitioner's counsel was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.321" offset="1444655">He showed up later that day, and the trial judge who was plainly irritated at counsel, refused at that point to grant a continuance or a psychiatric exam, and ordered the trial to begin immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.901" offset="1514977">At that point, counsel in the record, specifically stated that he was protesting against going to trial under those circumstances because his client was not fit to proceed and should be given a psychiatric exam.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.606" offset="1581746">The state judge was David McMillan of circuit court of the city of St Louis Mr. Justice and at that point, a specific record was made by the counsel against proceeding, but the trial commenced at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.172" offset="1648097">Now, at the trial which started in the afternoon of June 23 with the swearing of the jury, the evidence was began on the June, 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.284" offset="1692505">The victim, the petitioner's wife testified about the details of the rape and she also testified from the stand that she felt that her husband was mentally sick and in need of psychiatric care.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.583" offset="1745690">She testified that, from time to time when he didn't get his way, he would roll down the stairs to manifest his displeasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.134" offset="1787904">The state's case was not concluded on the 24 and on the morning of the 25, the next day when the court convened, the petitioner was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.246" offset="1836387">He was on bond and the court was advised, evidently by telephone, that he had been shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.989" offset="1871287">He had shot himself with the .22 that morning and had been taken to City Hospital in St. Louis and he was undergoing surgery.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.628" offset="2101896">Now at this point, the counsel for the petitioner moved for a mistrial, saying he had no client, and he could not continue with the trial, but the trial judge without a hearing or without any examination of the situation other than the telephone call he had received, summarily ruled that he -- that the petitioner brought this on himself and that the trial will proceed and the trial did proceed over this objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.219" offset="2212237">The state called four more witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.319" offset="2220596">The state put on proof of the petitioner's prior 1958 conviction for burglary.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.252" offset="2280364">And subsequent to that under the Missouri second offender statute, the court imposed the life sentence upon the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.858" offset="2310771">That conviction was affirmed by the Missouri Supreme Court on direct appeal and then the petitioner filed this proceeding under Missouri state post-conviction law which is Missouri Rule 27.26, the counterpart of habeas corpus and counsel was appointed to represent him at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.082" offset="2387675">At the hearing on the 27.26 motion, we brought in two psychiatrists who testified that a person having the symptoms and behaving like the petitioner did, was in need of psychiatric care and there was at least a reasonable doubt about his ability to proceed with trial and to understand the nature of the proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.894" offset="2722983">As I said if there is a bona fide doubt about competency, then a hearing must be had to determine whether he is fit to proceed and the test of competency is set forth in this Court's Dusky opinion, Dusky versus United States and it's two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.432" offset="2793096">Does he have a sufficient ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of understanding and secondly, does he have a rational and a factual understanding of the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="943.092" offset="3875715">The petitioner is on trial as I mentioned for rape which is punishable by death in the State of Missouri and was punishable by death at that time, being prior to this Court's decision in Furman against Georgia and the death penalty had not been waived by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.460" offset="3953246">Therefore, our position is that since this was a capital case, according to the decisions of this Court dating back to 1800s, the right to be present and to confront one's witnesses in a capital case cannot be waived and therefore, to continue the trial in the petitioner's absence was a violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.329" offset="4056691">To my knowledge, this Court has never upheld the conviction of a defendant who was absent in a capital case during a major portion of this trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.286" offset="6544488">Pate of course, requires such a hearing or examination for every bona fide doubt of that person's competency exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.984" offset="6571342">I think it's necessary to determine or to define what bona fide doubt of a person's competency to proceed is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.877" offset="6650859">But the lower federal courts have go on to define as substantial facts of one's -- challenging one's competency or also reasonable cause to believe one might not be competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.077" offset="6699656">Reasonable cause is simply the language used by Missouri statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.495" offset="6717315">I think the real key here and what I want to emphasize on behalf of the State of Missouri, is the phrase competency to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.016" offset="6743437">It is not a mental disease or defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.383" offset="6752946">It is whether or not that person can consult with counsel, assist in his defense, and whether he has a rational, knows facts and understanding of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.341" offset="6796727">Having set that as -- set the tone for the argument and saying that it is simply a matter of applying the facts in this case to the Pate test, I would like to discuss the facts relied on by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.840" offset="6842702">First, in his brief he contends that very nature of the crime should point to incompetency to proceed and as he stated, the crime involved a rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.901" offset="6882931">At the time of the crime the petitioner was intoxicated, or at least had been drinking for several hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.960" offset="6907173">So, you have an intoxication, you have a sexual perversion involved in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.384" offset="6924936">These elements or these mental diseases are specifically exempted on a Missouri statute, as being cause to believe a man is not competent to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.094" offset="6967777">Logically, I see no reason why a man's sexual perversion or intoxication means that he could not consult his counsel in a rational manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.090" offset="7007692">Two other factors are that the petitioner's counsel, trial counsel, secured a psychiatric examination form, and also the report handed down by the psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.488" offset="7053354">I would like to quote from that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.307" offset="7080626">On pages 8-12 or 13 of the appendix, on page 11 the psychiatric states, “There was no sign as to the presence of any delusions, illusions, hallucinations, obsessions, ideas of reference, compulsions or phobias.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.080" offset="7147708">He goes on to state that Mr. Drope was well oriented in all spheres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.189" offset="7164113">He knew what time it was obviously, he knew where he was, he knew what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.061" offset="7183653">He got the goes – the psychiatrist went on to state that Mr. Drope was able without trouble to answer questions testing judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.706" offset="7218239">He also said that he didn't even find any strong signs of psychosis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.947" offset="7275186">Slightly before the last statement, in the middle of the page he -- the psychiatrist states at that apparently abnormal sexual acts are part of Mr. Drope's own culture and he concludes that Mr. Drope as an neurotic individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.471" offset="7329207">He is a Sociopath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.811" offset="7334640">He has sexual perversions and that he should be under the care of a psychiatric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.768" offset="7354493">What I do want to emphasize the statements by the psychiatrics that he was able without trouble to answer questions, testing judgment that he was oriented in all spheres and that he was not under any delusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.686" offset="7402141">These factors I believe go to the competency of Mr. Drope to proceed with trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.933" offset="7419068">They go with the competency of him to consult with counsel to reason, to assist his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.954" offset="7451146">I think on the whole the psychiatric report in effect substantiates the fact that Mr. Drope was competent rather then suggest that he was incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.542" offset="7505586">Another fact relied on by the petitioner who had his counsel move for continuance and asked for the psychiatric examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.952" offset="7539231">The motion for the continuance is find on Page-seven of the appendix and the close reading of that emotion indicates that he is simply asking for psychiatric evaluation based on the psychiatrist report wherein the psychiatrist said he should be under his psychiatric care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.401" offset="7608926">Petitioner's counsel did not state that he felt that the petitioner should have psychiatric help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.756" offset="7630346">He did not state anywhere in the record that he ever felt petitioner could not communicate with him, that he could not assist him or that he was not assisting or consulting or helping him in his defense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neil MacFarlane</label>
            <text syncTime="1936.513" offset="7849462">No Your Honor, he did not and it's quite obvious from the report that he did not proceed under the Missouri Statute which sets out certain requirements and certain findings there must be made in a psychiatric report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.152" offset="7911946">I would also like to point out that the motion for continuance has really all the earmarks of a dilatory motion rather than one where that counsel was truly concern with his client's competency to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.354" offset="7964818">The trial was initially set on April, late on April and continued until May 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.420" offset="7985089">This motion was filed on May 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.408" offset="7997001">The record was not indicate that why there was a one day difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.500" offset="8009331">But the report at any rate came three months after the psychiatrist had handed his report to petitioner's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.659" offset="8037961">And at the beginning of the trial there was a colloquy between the court and counsel wherein the court informed counsel that the assignment division, another division of the circuit court wherein pretrial motions are held, had advised petitioner's counsel that if he was truly serious about the motion, he should file it in proper form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.088" offset="8123747">Now, petitioner's counsel on his appeal, on his certiorari has challenged that statement by saying what is proper form?</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.352" offset="8156766">The state contends that proper form with the form would be a motion stating that the man could not communicate and consult and that he did not follow the Dusky test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.991" offset="8191352">In another words, he could not get assist in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.959" offset="8211205">Another fact that lined up by the petitioner is that the State of Missouri, acquiesced in the motion for continuance in the course for psychiatric examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.337" offset="8244746">This is simply office policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.926" offset="8251120">There is no decision whether or not to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.657" offset="8258017">It is simply done in all cases by the Circuit Attorney's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.696" offset="8286124">Petitioner's wife testified that at times petitioner would roll down a flight of stairs when he didn't get his way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.908" offset="8310993">He did this three or four times in a period of 8 to 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.617" offset="8325831">As the Court of Appeals stated, this simply demonstrates the childish nature of the petitioner at that times, but it does not point any incompetency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.803" offset="8366582">Also, petitioner's wife signed a statement at one time since she felt that petitioner was mentally ill, should not go to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.934" offset="8399078">This was refuted doing the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.523" offset="8409422">She said she signed that statement because she want to petitioner to be on the street, so he could help support the children and her care and concern was for her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.551" offset="8449546">And in direct question, in direct answer to a question by petitioner's trial counsel as to whether or not she felt petitioner was mentally ill after she had talked with psychiatrist, she said no she did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.716" offset="8506284">The most troublesome fact of course in this case is a shooting incident wherein the petitioner apparently attempted to commit suicide, at least shot himself on the morning of the third day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.770" offset="8558425">This in on itself is of course does not establish incompetency to proceed and I think the fact surrounding this shooting are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.809" offset="8598653">The petitioner had sat through the previous day testimony by his wife, alleging testifying to all of facts of the crime itself and he also heard testimony from people who were at the police station the day following the incident in which he confessed to the crime and contended that it had all started out as a joke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.529" offset="8685484">I think at that point he was well aware that there was overwhelming evidence against him and that he would probably be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.065" offset="8715682">In such he was a in quite desperate straits, but it does show that he was very aware of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.766" offset="8750477">Petitioner has cited here on footnote several cases and asked this Court to compare the fact situation therein all going to the course of competency to proceed with the fact situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.656" offset="8801991">The state also invites to court to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.575" offset="8813693">There is no general rule that can be garnered from those cases, but I think if the Court were compare them, it will find that in many of those cases the defendants had a long history of mental illness, often coupled with violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.905" offset="8863013">In one case there was five repeated acts of suicide, in two or more cases there was legal adjudication of insanity at one time or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.531" offset="8897494">In several there was incarceration in an asylum and in several also the counsel for those defendants felt that the defendant could not proceed to trial and could not assist him and consult with him in a rational manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.648" offset="8970010">I think it is also important in this case to consider the evidence appear before the Court and at what time it appeared and I say this because the Trial Court had an opportunity to observe the appellant or the petitioner during a day and a half of the trial before the man shot himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.744" offset="9038346">The Trial Court had the opportunity to observe him consulting with his counsel and to observe him as he appeared in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.424" offset="9069066">I think at that point it would take a little bit more evidence to suggest a bona fide doubt of incompetency and this of course occurred just before the shooting incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.555" offset="9125595">Following the trial in a collateral attack on his conviction in a motion under the Missouri Supreme Court Rule 27.26, two psychiatrist testify and in effect they were asked hypothetical questions and both stated that under these facts they felt the man should have been psychiatrically examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.628" offset="9205844">I would like to point out that those were hypothetical questions that neither while one psychiatrist had examines by petitioner about four months before trial and that is the examination contained in the report, neither tested him for the purpose of competency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.143" offset="9275956">I think a lay witness, if he could be called a witness, in this case a Trial Judge was in a better position to observe that man and to tell whether or not it would meet the Dusky test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.172" offset="9400090">At time of the 27.26 hearing Mr. Watson was quite ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.986" offset="9419316">There was some suggestion that he be deposed, but that never happened and his thoughts as to whether or not the petitioner was incompetent or whether or not there was a bona fide doubt as to his competency does not appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.043" offset="9491519">In summary of point one I would like to emphasize at here we are concerned not with mental illness or mental abnormalities or sexual perversions or sociopathic tendencies, but we are concerned with the ability of the petitioner to understand the charge against him, the facts against him, to understand the proceedings against him, to consult with his counsel, to communicate and to assist and aid in his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.128" offset="9587858">I think if you look through the facts, brought forth by the petitioner's counsel which at first blush might suggest a bona fide doubt is to produce a counsel of proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.383" offset="10932955">The foundation case relied on by petitioner, the Diaz case, a 1912 case from this Court and the rule from that case is dicta because that was not a capital case and it was not necessary for the Court to answer the question of whether or not his absence in a capital case would be -- would violate his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.271" offset="11012472">There are many, many cases interpreting Diaz, but they are all based on the dictum from that case. In that case, the quote from that case reads, “that a man who was in custody cannot be held to voluntarily absent himself from trial, nor can one who was charged with a capital offense because he is deemed to suffer the constraint naturally incident to an apprehension of the awful penalty that would follow conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.451" offset="11129187">I am not sure what the constraint incident and apprehension of obviously the death penalty is, that would prevent him going to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.256" offset="11164400">At any rate in this case I think the petitioner's counsel or petitioner Diaz’s counsel, he would have been well aware that the death penalty while technically could have been imposed, as a practical matter it would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.065" offset="11215600">I say this simply because of my experience with the people who are on death row in Missouri’s State Penitentiary prior to the Furman decision and there were no people on there who had not committed very atrocious acts of homicide, killing policeman, one person killed 12 people at one time and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.505" offset="11293341">The death penalty while a technical possibility was not practical and in that respect I don’t think there was any apprehension of the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.124" offset="11355826">Furthermore, there is no logical reason to differentiate between a person who can absent himself during a non-capital offense and one who does during a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.913" offset="11395009">In either case, the court would be left at the whim or caprice of the defendant who could simply disrupt the proceedings and stop the proceedings by absenting himself from the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.584" offset="11453733">Moreover, in this case of course the death penalty was not assessed or if he did not receive a capital sentence it is hard to determine why the rule of Diaz should govern.</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.382" offset="14192933">The fact is that there is no form as such under Missouri law and Missouri practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.428" offset="14217070">The counsel for the petitioner clearly stated in the record that he objected to going forward, because his man was not competent to proceed and needed a psychiatric evaluation and a hearing.</text>
