            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">In the Alyeska case, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that if -- that the appellees -- or respondents, Wilderness Society and others were entitled to attorney's fees for at least partially prevailing in an action which they brought charging that the award of a right of way for a pipeline was invalid under the relevant federal statutes providing for rights of way and under the Environmental Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.885" offset="111491">Neither Act provides for the award of attorney's fee but the Court of Appeals held that the courts had the authority to award fees since they had in the Court's view acted as private attorneys general in enforcing important federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.041" offset="168124">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.530" offset="174080">The award of attorney's fees in context such as these is a matter for Congress and not for the courts and the Court of Appeals had no authority to order otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.902" offset="211592">The judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.602" offset="218384">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion as had Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.762" offset="238968">Justices Douglas and Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
