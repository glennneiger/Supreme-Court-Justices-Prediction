            <text syncTime="9.628" offset="38452">This case comes to us from the District Court for the Northern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.515" offset="57992">Under Texas law, only those residents of an election district who have “rendered” their properties for taxation are permitted to vote in local board elects -- on the elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.937" offset="111700">This means that only those who list their real, mixed, or personal property with the local tax assessor are granted the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.504" offset="142002">A group of residents of Fort Worth, Texas brought this suit in the Federal District Court seeking to invalidate that restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.136" offset="172513">The three-judge court held that the applicable Texas laws limiting the franchise to those who surrendered property for taxation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.512" offset="217966">In an opinion on file to the clerk today, we point out that in Kramer versus the Union School District, we held that as long as an election is not one of special interest, a state cannot erect a classification restricting the franchise on grounds other than residence, age, and citizenship unless that classification satisfies a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.899" offset="315559">And again in the City of Phoenix, we held that a general obligation of revenue bond elections are elections of general interest subject to the principles of the Kramer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.848" offset="359340">Accordingly, since the restrictions in this case serve no compelling state interest consisted election was one of general interest, the franchise restriction cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.631" offset="406465">We therefore affirm the opinion of the -- the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.410" offset="425587">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stewart joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.864" offset="451396">Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
