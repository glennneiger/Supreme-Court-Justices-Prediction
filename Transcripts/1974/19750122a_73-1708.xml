            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments first today in number 73-1708, Burns against Alcala.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.205" offset="144175">Mr. Attorney General, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_c_turner" startTime="15.585" stopTime="219.797">
            <label>Mr. Richard C. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="15.585" offset="165700">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.914" offset="195062">Burns, the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services of the State of Iowa against Linda Alcala, Jane Doe and Joan Roe, is here on cert from the Eighth Circuit which upheld the decision of Judge Hanson in the Southern District of Iowa in a case of statutory construction of the Social Welfare Act that an unborn child or a mother of an unborn child is entitled to AFDC, Aid to Families with Dependent Children.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.362" offset="400802">It involves Titles IV and V of the Social Security Act passed by the 74th Congress in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.841" offset="442702">Title IV being -- pertaining to ADC or later AFDC and Title V pertaining to Maternal and Child Health Care.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.782" offset="502471">I would first like to quote to the Court part of the relevant statutes 602, Title 42 of the U.S. Code Section 602 (a) (10) which says that aid in a -- if a state has ADC and of course a states does not have to have a program as I understand of Aid to the Dependent Children but all including Iowa do, it must furnish with reasonable promptness.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.587" offset="685746">It says that Aid to Families with Dependent Children shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.892" offset="730990">In this case, the plaintiffs were three unmarried pregnant women without children and otherwise qualified for ADC.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.186" offset="788146">They have no employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.241" offset="796296">They were without any savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.084" offset="807685">They made application for AFDC for their unborn children.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.394" offset="836942">Then if I may state the issues which I think are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.136" offset="859930">First, the question is, is a pregnant woman a mother before her child is born?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.216" offset="896188">Second, is she prior to birth a parent within the meaning of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="209.904" offset="943000">If she has no obligation to support her child in regard to diet, nutrition and things to that kind --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="219.797" stopTime="223.191">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="219.797" offset="982601">When you say obligation, do you mean legal obligation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_c_turner" startTime="223.191" stopTime="845.881">
            <label>Mr. Richard C. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="223.191" offset="996185">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.922" offset="999111">A legal obligation or duty if she has none, King versus Smith which pertains to a substitute father without a legal obligation and still another decision of this Court which pertained to a stepfather who had not adopted his child and was held to have no legal obligation was held not to be a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.002" offset="1103391">Following that logic and been perhaps that stretching logic to extremes, the mother is not a parent if she has no duty to support the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.763" offset="1182386">Now, Judge Pell's dissent in a case of Wilson versus Weaver which I believe was out of the Third Circuit involving cases from Illinois and Indiana indicated that neither a parent, neither mother or father is a parent before birth and that even the real father has no duty to support the unborn child before it's born.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.532" offset="1317491">So, one of the questions here is whether perhaps if a woman has a right to abort her child she can be said to have a duty to support her fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.728" offset="1382275">But let's assume for that the pregnant woman is a parent before birth, are the woman and her fetus together a family?</text>
            <text syncTime="333.126" offset="1435878">I submit not.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.138" offset="1443924">Not in the ordinary sense of the meaning of that word and it is families which are to be furnished this aid with reasonable promptness.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.376" offset="1484884">Does it need the pregnant woman derive a right to ADC from a fetus and the ultimate question then here before us?</text>
            <text syncTime="358.800" offset="1538591">Is a fetus a dependent child?</text>
            <text syncTime="364.141" offset="1559907">Now, dependent child in the AFDC law is a defined term.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.732" offset="1610271">In Section 606 for what would be 406 of the Act but 606 of the United States Code when used in this part the term “dependent child” means a needy child one who has been deprived of parental support or by reason of the death continued absence from the home or physical or mental incapacity of a parent and who is living with his father, mother, grandfather, grandmother and a whole series of relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.701" offset="1766170">In other words, if the child is not living with one of those relatives including the father and mother in a residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.505" offset="1833357">Then, under the statutory definition enacted by Congress it would appear that it's not a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.068" offset="1883617">Now, there's a far cry between a home and a womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.862" offset="1906813">It seems to me and unless the child is actually in the home according to all intense and purpose of the statute it would appear that it's not a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.174" offset="1976090">Now, in 1971 for the first time in February 1971 and I believe this is for the first time that HEW or any social -- federal social welfare agency actually published a rule which made it optional for states to grant payments to allow payments or to make federal -- “federal financial participation” is available in payments with respect to an unborn child with the fact -- when the fact of pregnancy has been determined by medical diagnosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.893" offset="2158947">That I contend is the first time the public ever really realize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.773" offset="2182457">The first time it was really published for general circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.736" offset="2198340">Now, there is some evidence herein or some indication in the briefs that in that ADC handbook as far back as 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.116" offset="2243793">The handbook which is of limited circulation given only to local agencies but from the federal government as far back as 1946 they recognized the states optional right and its option to pay ADC for an unborn child.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.746" offset="2326340">And it appears that as of 1971 according to the Alcala case some 18 states and the District of Columbia made AFDC available; 34 states and territories and jurisdictions including Iowa did not then have not made ADC available to an unborn child.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.523" offset="2433442">Now, immediately in the 92nd Congress I think upon learning for the first time of this then first to published regulation both the House and the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee introduced committee bills to make it clear that unborn children were not to be considered entitled to ADC that they were not dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.035" offset="2551515">They were to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.856" offset="2562800">Now, much as made of the fact that those bills did not pass and I'll get to that in a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.756" offset="2602402">Since 1972, when these bills did not pass, all of these cases have a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.936" offset="2635107">I think some 18 or I don't know how many courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.602" offset="2653811">Lower district courts have decided this and no less than Sixth Circuits have now ruled on it and the Sixth Circuits whole of five out six that an unborn child or fetus is entitled to welfare payments under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.355" offset="2748792">The one exception is the wisdom with the case of Wisdom versus Norton out of the Second Circuit decided in October 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.634" offset="2785886">That case had and considered all previous cases from all the Circuits and all the lower courts had those available.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.191" offset="2824129">Since then, in December, the Fifth Circuit has also decided this matter but this again in favor of the unborn child those cases rose out of Georgia and Mississippi in Parks v. Harden.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.204" offset="2896227">Now, Wisdom in October had the benefit of the Fourth Circuits holding the other way but Parks did not have Wisdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.797" offset="2934575">No plan intended but Parks did not consider the Circuit Court's decision in Wisdom which I submit is extremely well reasoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.827" offset="2986715">So, in any event the score right now for the position that I take is three judges in Wisdom who were unanimous that the fetus is not a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.276" offset="3032482">Two dissents coming from Wilson versus Weaver and one of them Judge Pell and Judge Haynsworth in Parks v. Harden also dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.057" offset="3083577">And then of course there were three District Court judges two form Florida and one from Georgia who wrote opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.820" offset="3106670">So, a total of eight judges have taken the position that a fetus is not a child and not entitled to ADC.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.845" offset="3134777">Now, what is the basis of the general holding?</text>
            <text syncTime="763.756" offset="3158392">I think they can be summed up into about five different categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.968" offset="3175215">The case is holding that an unborn child is a dependent child.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.767" offset="3194441">First, they say that the Act is not helpful or clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.562" offset="3213667">You can't help from reading the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.807" offset="3226624">Of course I disagree as I will tell him a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.755" offset="3246373">Secondly, that there is no legislative history that one case said that the legislative history is opaque.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.773" offset="3274480">Absolutely, I disagree; I think there's all kinds of legislative history in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.952" offset="3307186">Third, they say that the HEW interpretations of longstanding are entitled to substantial weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.762" offset="3342399">And of course they are except for one major flaw and that is that the Government says and has maintained in the amicus brief has been filed by the Solicitor General that HEW has never really considered that the statute entitled an unborn child AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.740" offset="3450337">They have allowed this is an optional thing but beyond what they themselves considered the statute allowed.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="845.881" offset="3486908">General Turner, as I understand your opponent's contention is that if it could be allowed even as an option it must be under that statutory grounds and therefore it would be mandatory?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_c_turner" startTime="859.963" stopTime="878.346">

            <text syncTime="860.853" offset="3546781">I think that is true, I think if an unborn child is eligible for ADC that it must be allowed and it is mandatory and if there is no optional borderline, I don't agree with any optional standard at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.983" offset="3659316">Well, do you agree when the Wisdom holding that the regulation is invalid because statute does not cover fetuses and an unborn child?</text>
            <text syncTime="899.036" offset="3699545">Wisdom held that the regulation is invalid, did it not?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="902.421" offset="3713024">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.035" offset="3715532">I do agree that the regulation is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.132" offset="3731937">And I don't see how you can put a regulation in violation of a clear case.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.419" offset="3753044">Now, these cases rely on the triad of King, Townsend and Remillard.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.549" offset="3781569">Three of your cases which say that you can't read in; you got to -- you can't look for -- there must be a clear indication of an exclusion from the class of those eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.084" offset="3871744">And there I submit that one doesn't determine if an exclusion can be found until eligibility has been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.844" offset="3906748">And I think the courts below have seem to miss that point and this Court indicated that in fact in the Dublino case where it said, “In those cases, it was clear that state law excluded people from AFDC benefits from the Social Security Act expressly provided would be eligible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="975.624" offset="4005909">Well, for example in Townsend that was the case where the college student was held to be able to have ADC while going to college.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.747" offset="4046346">The access he can he can in very clear terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.299" offset="4056586">It's expressed in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.474" offset="4065259">The Court here goes on to say the Court found no room either in the ex language or legislative history to warrant the states additional eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.738" offset="4102353">Hereby contrast the Act allows for complementary state work incentive programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.712" offset="4142268">The Dublino case -- the distinguishing case was the one out of New York where they allowed, they said that the WIN program did not preempt the state work program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1249.941" offset="5103156">I'd like to dwell on that a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.342" offset="5120711">First of all, a statute is to be construed according to its plain meaning in the common understanding are meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.720" offset="5162297">There are virtually hundreds perhaps thousands of cases so holding that cited under statutes key number 188.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.246" offset="5192391">I blushed to even mention the citation and not every statute is open to construction as a matter of courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.239" offset="5232306">So, you don't even look at the HEW rules and regulations if the statute is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.143" offset="5255920">Those are fundamental things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.931" offset="5263130">You don't search for ambiguities that don't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.116" offset="5283819">Ambiguities that may be imagined by an acute and powerful intellect in the quiet of his law office or something that you should not look for, and I think that's where those imagining scheme here that this statute is unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.945" offset="5351111">This statute is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.518" offset="5361455">The pattern of it is clear just as it was clear in King when it construed what is a parent and whether a substitute parent is a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.263" offset="5404400">And they said that it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.163" offset="5415999">In King they looked at it at the entire statute and they considered various sections all through it and said that they were all consistent with the fact that a parent had to be one who was legally obligated to support this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.944" offset="5503143">Judge Pell -- in our brief, we mentioned Judge Pell's decision on page 9 of our brief pointed out in his dissent a good many various sections that indicated the child actually had to be living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.370" offset="5596871">For example in 42 601 or the words care of dependent children in their own homes and now there's a whole list to these in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.589" offset="5637726">I'm not going to go through them but various places throughout the statute cover that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.573" offset="5665625">And Wisdom versus Norton noted that a child when you refer to a child you're not ever in normal parlance talking about a fetus and that is why it's modified by the word “unborn” when you are or possibly inventory smear which means in the womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.902" offset="5782967">Child born -- a child that's already been born is never modified by a term like post partum as was used in the Parks case the most recent case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.746" offset="6654307">As Mr. Turner has recognized this case really involves purely a question of statutory interpretation and ultimately the question comes down to whether an unborn child is a dependent child within the meaning of Title IV of the Social Security Act and a particular Section 406 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.683" offset="6742079">Now, if as a vast majority of the lower courts have held an unborn child is a dependent child for purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.176" offset="6780113">Then, under this Court's prior decision the states must make needy pregnant women eligible for AFDC assistance with respect to their unborn children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.603" offset="6833821">On the other hand if an unborn child is not a dependent child within the meaning of the Act then no state may receive federal matching funds to make such AFDC payments because if an unborn child is not a dependent child there simply is no authority in the Social Security Act for the Secretary of HEW to make those matching payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.312" offset="7072580">Now, the position of HEW is that an unborn child is not a dependent child but under the Secretary's rulemaking power under 42 U.S.C. 1302, the Secretary has a kind of general legislative power to create whole new programs as long as he's willing to say that in some way the new assistance is related to the provisions of the Act as drafted by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.604" offset="9365817">It may also be a reflection of Congress' judgment in passing that Code that the additional expenses for an unborn child are somewhat less than those for born child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.787" offset="9418480">That could be reflected in this case through a smaller level of benefits and not through cutting off eligibility all together.</text>

            <text syncTime="2350.225" offset="9504266">And I suppose the strongest evidence for that at this stage is that the great majority of federal judges who have passed on this have not found it very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.203" offset="9552227">One can cite dictionary definitions both ways, one can cite Shakespeare as oppose to other colloquial statements going either way, and in some, they're really not that helpful except to indicate that dependent child can reasonably be interpreted to include unborn children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.572" offset="9637700">And it then becomes necessary to look at the statutory purposes and at longstanding HEW interpretations in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.453" offset="10541223">First of all in terms of the clarity of the language, Title V doesn't talk about unborn children it talks about mothers and children and that Act was very early on and has always been interpreted to include prenatal care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.452" offset="10597230">Moreover, Title V is restricted to certain health services, it does not extend to every jurisdiction in the United States and it provides certain kinds of nutritional advice for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.086" offset="10651669">But it provides no funds to follow the nutritional advice for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.778" offset="10678523">Now, Title V covers born children as well as unborn children and so does Title IV and as the First Circuit recognized in Carver versus Hooker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.479" offset="10717288">It's a little in Congress to suppose that Congress gave both to born children and limited unborn children to just the Title V assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.160" offset="10751979">So, I think Title V of anything is further evidence of a congressional purpose to include unborn children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.173" offset="10784057">Now, that congressional purpose I think becomes more clear in 1950 than it really was in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.311" offset="10816658">And one thing that has not really clear from the briefs in this case is that as of 1935 to interpret dependent child to include unborn children only meant that the states were free to provide assistance with respect to unborn children if they so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.824" offset="10894712">It was optional then and that was because the entire program was optional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.640" offset="10913938">The Section 406 (a) simply defined a large group and the states were totally free in terms of the Act to pick and choose groups with in that eligible group.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.304" offset="11204629">But I don't think there's any special significance about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.363" offset="11216854">Now, the addition of 402 (a) (10) as this Court has held in King, in Townsend, in Carleson changed the relationship between the state and federal standards markedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.986" offset="11267323">It required now that within this large group of eligible individuals that the states had to pay to everybody who was eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.234" offset="11304312">Now, in 1946, the Bureau of Public Assistance had officially promulgated in the Handbook of Public Assistance Administration a regulation which included unborn children in the eligible group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.027" offset="11367528">And the history of that regulation and its very terms make it absolutely clear that that was a matter of interpretation of Section 406 (a) and that the agency was signing for purposes of this Act that unborn child is a dependent child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.556" offset="11441612">And if HEW was implying in its brief and I couldn't quite tell that the agency has never interpreted dependent child in that way, that simply ignores this entire history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.190" offset="11492080">Now, what one has then is in 1950 when the mandatory eligibility provisions are enacted, the agency entrusted with administration of the Act has for several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.231" offset="11552266">In fact, earlier than 1946 declared that unborn children are within that eligible group that Congress now says must be given assistance by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.740" offset="11606288">And that interpretation by the Bureau also has an independent significance quite apart from the 1950 Social Security Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.154" offset="11651950">This Court has held on many occasions that administrative interpretation of statutory terms are entitled to great weight at least when they are consistent with the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.835" offset="11698761">Now, this interpretation of dependent child to include unborn children began at least as early as 1940 and as addendum H to the respondent's brief indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.874" offset="11758843">In fact, this was a problem that was being considered really from the very beginning of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.842" offset="11790712">That interpretation then was made roughly contemporaneously with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.429" offset="11809102">It is an interpretation of longstanding in the sense that it survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.885" offset="11830941">For over 30 years, it survived the passage of Section 402 (a) (10) and the only reason one perhaps can't say it still hasn't survived is that HEW now has come in and disavowed that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.422" offset="11901053">I think when one looks at HEW's position, its so tied with an absurd view of its powers under 1302 that it's not entitle to any weight.</text>
