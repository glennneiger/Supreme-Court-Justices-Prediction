            <label>Mr. Alan Latman</label>
            <text syncTime="18.817" offset="178657">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.002" offset="191404">This is an action for copyright infringement against the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.410" offset="209063">It is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.830" offset="226722">It's brought under the provisions of Title 28 United States Code Section 1498(b) which is an eminent domain type of statute passed by Congress 15 years ago to cover cases of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.018" offset="283460">And the exclusive remedy of that statute is an action in the Court of Claims for reasonable compensation, therefore there's no injunction possible in this case nor is any sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.897" offset="334973">The issue is whether the Government system of reproducing petitioner's copyrighted journal articles in their entirety through library photocopying is compensable under this jurisdictional statute as copyright infringement or excusable under the defense of fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.749" offset="410415">Petitioner believes that this issue vitally affects the future of journal such as its medical and scientific journals involved in this case ranging to journals of political affairs, poetry, literary journals which have a small circulation, privately published and respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.184" offset="484080">Petitioner also believes that this issue should be resolved in favor of compensation because its property, namely its copyrights, has been taken and it should be reasonably compensated.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.415" offset="532982">I say taken because the Government system of furnishing reproductions here come within the policy and the language of the copyright statute which provides exclusive rights to print, reprint, publish and copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.778" offset="598497">And the defense of fair use is completely inapplicable as I'll indicate in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.217" offset="620231">That's a doctrine and a defense that applies to an incidental use by one writer of someone else's work in terms of a portion of the work but never so as to constitute an effective substitute for the original work.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.632" offset="681880">In this case --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="145.449" offset="685119">Has the doctrine of fair use ever been upheld or specifically adopted by any opinion in this Court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_latman" startTime="153.669" stopTime="209.032">
            <label>Mr. Alan Latman</label>
            <text syncTime="153.669" offset="718033">I don't believe it has, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the doctrine was raised in the so-called Jack Benny case which did reach this Court and it was a case which held that a taking of someone else's work either even as a parity constituted infringement, that was a Ninth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.577" offset="789713">The affirmance by this Court was four to four of necessity and without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.287" offset="816567">The issue also was raised in a case involving Admiral Richover where Mr. Justice Reed, who was then retired was sitting in the District of Columbia Circuit and he had some remarks to say about fair use which we do quote in our brief which we think are pertinent, basically that taking a whole work has never been held to be fair use but when it came to this Court, the judgment was vacated for an insufficient record on other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.573" offset="929625">So I think the answer to the question has to be no.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan Latman</label>
            <text syncTime="214.956" offset="963166">That's correct, it was -- Mr. Benny put on what he called auto light as a parity of gas light.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.961" offset="991169">He had the same star, Ingrid Bergman and the District Court and the Ninth Circuit held that even though parity changed the serious melodrama of gas light to a comity, nevertheless, the defense of fair use did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.120" offset="1055848">Nevertheless it was infringement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="241.238" stopTime="242.929">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="241.238" offset="1068283">And that was affirmed by an equally divided Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan Latman</label>
            <text syncTime="242.929" offset="1075075">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.301" offset="1108616">The learning of those cases is that the essence of fair use is that it should not -- the use should not be an effective substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.564" offset="1137664">In this case, when we're dealing with a photocopy of a 40 or 50 page article, we think it's unquestionable that that does substitute for the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.169" offset="1176012">The trial judge held for the petitioner on the issue of liability, reserving the amount of reasonable compensation for later determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.507" offset="1209448">The Court of Claims in a four to three decision disagreed and dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.633" offset="1233899">The Government agencies involved are two libraries of the Department of Health Education and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.990" offset="1259290">One is the National Library of Medicine, which is a library's library.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.520" offset="1277471">It sits at the apex of a nationwide network of 10 regional and 400 local medical libraries.</text>

          <turn speaker="alan_latman" startTime="306.726" stopTime="393.847">
            <label>Mr. Alan Latman</label>
            <text syncTime="306.726" offset="1330239">They vary, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.160" offset="1335986">They include not only other Government libraries and medical schools and institutions but also private companies including drug companies for example, and the service that the National Library of Medicine renders to this variety of constituents is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.398" offset="1400978">And that service is, that they take a few subscriptions as does the sister library, the National Institutes of Health or NIH.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.030" offset="1447476">NIH is a -- as Your Honors know here, in Bethesda it's a super library and it's a super institution, it furnishes its thousands of employees with their needs for journals, subscribing to only one or two copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.095" offset="1507767">Now concededly, these copies don't do the job by themselves so as an integral part of the operations of both libraries, there is a system of the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.243" offset="1560325">When a patron or the staff wants a journal, he or she gets a complete photocopy of the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.606" offset="1593762">It's complete, it's no return, it's free.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.892" offset="1614973">I say free, I mean there's no charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.098" offset="1623751">Of course it costs the taxpayer money indeed the Government pays the xerox corporation for each page they copy and of course they do not pay the people who produce and disseminate the material being copied.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.576" offset="1717687">Was namely to take notes by hand and then in the turn of the century and in the going up to the thirties, there was the system of Photostats and rather elaborate system of dark room facilities which meant that until you got to the era of Xerox, Mr. Justice Stewart, you had a situation where it was impracticable and uneconomical and slow to reproduce an entire article.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.526" offset="1829491">And that's why we think that all those methods, hand, typewriter, mimeograph, whatever the system was, it was a system geared to taking notes as we all do, making an excerpt or taking a Photostat of one page or a chart whereas the era of Xerox, which the party seem to admit really came in the early 60's, to think that the opinion below and the Government's brief here and the Government's brief below concedes the fact that in the early 60's, late 50's, there was virtually no photocopying as we know it today.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.631" offset="2009945">No, I don't believe the record is conclusive one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.928" offset="2023111">I don't think I could say they subscribed to more, however, we have a few sequels really, one is this, that in certain areas, for example one of the journals ensued is called Journal of Immunology.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.763" offset="2082461">I suppose we all recognize that in the era of transplants, in the era of cancer research and the like, that the interest in immunology has so mushroomed that for subscriptions to stay about the same, which in many cases they have, or for reprints which is an alternative form that the publisher has, now as the publisher doesn't only sell subscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.054" offset="2171591">Publisher is interested in disseminating this material, that's what it's in the business of doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.489" offset="2189354">So that in addition to subscriptions, it sells reprints, it licenses microfilm which is another convenient alternative form of utilization and indeed, it has an authorized photocopying agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.525" offset="2249435">So that these alternative forms which are needed to keep these very small base journals alive, for example take Medicine or Journal of Immunology, there are four journals ensued and even though everyone agrees these are the respected journals in their fields in the world, the journals that have subscriptions from three to seven thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.309" offset="2340655">The subscription price for six or 12 issues are $12.00 or $44.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.782" offset="2362493">The National Library of Medicine in achieving this, has a system of an overhead microfilm camera which swings up and down the aisles of the stocks of the library to take photographs of the journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.330" offset="2420694">Now there is one, does not even have to bring the journal out.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.125" offset="2431875">And I mentioned that only to indicate that this is an integral day-by-day operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.319" offset="2448697">Similarly, National Institute of Health have four employees who do nothing else all day but grind out these reprints and in the year in question, in the record, it shows that that operation at NIH with those four full time employees, entails an expenditure of slightly more than the library spent for acquisition of journals.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.512" offset="2645452">Now they're purchased and of course the amount of reprints that were purchased in the past used to be an indication of the popularity of the articles, something that the editors are interested in but it isn't anymore and we think the reason that it isn't anymore is that once the reprints which are furnished by the author to people who request it are used up that the people just photocopy.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.136" offset="2795917">We don't think there's any barriers, we think that -- but in order to facilitate the situation, because in the past it is hard to stock actual back copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.455" offset="2841161">Our client has authorized to reprint houses to furnish reprints and secondly as I indicated, a photocopying agency to furnish people with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.990" offset="2887346">So that while there may be a barrier, we think that the key is authorized photocopying because I would like to emphasize to the Court that in this situation, the petitioner is not interested in stopping or slowing down or halting this photocopying at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.257" offset="2956413">What the proprietor is interested in doing is securing some reasonable royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.465" offset="2977207">Therefore Mr. Chief Justice, we think that working through our licensed representative is one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.013" offset="3011375">If one would consider that that's too slow and that that's a barrier, then the alternative which we would prefer and which we've offered is a blanket license covering all the journal articles which could be paid for by the library when they buy the subscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.946" offset="3083160">And so far, that's all proposals that we made have been turned down because as our efforts show, when we try to setup such a system before the lawsuit, we were told that there would be no system of royalties until a Court ordered the Government to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.446" offset="8677125">It is not the outside use, it's the National Library of Medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.884" offset="8694888">And for a while the increase in photocopying did increase until about 1968 then it took a dip and I think it is now back up somewhere near the 1968 level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.085" offset="8747760">But it has been a strong factor for some time but I think it's important for me to say that this has been a practice which has been understood, not to violate the Copyright Act of 1909 for decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.654" offset="8805961">Our brief refers to and I will not take this through evidence of that, the gentleman's agreement of 1935 which is answered by a statement that we're not bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.729" offset="8846294">Nobody suggested the petitioner is bound by that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.616" offset="8857788">One does suggest that it indicates an understanding of practices at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.879" offset="8882866">The Sound and Recording Act of 1971 which we discussed in our brief at pages 18 and 19, I will not take time now to point out but that is an evidence that Congress said two things, that people may make recordings for their personal use from copyrighted recordings without violating the Act and that the reason they left people free to do that was that they didn't want to give copyright protection broader than other holders of Copyrights Act which would seem to be a statement by Congress that they understood the 1909 statute, not to extend to non-commercial copying for private use but we need not, I think spend our time rehearsing the long practice or taking gleanings from legislative understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.151" offset="9071992">Because I think there are two cases in this Court that are quite parallel and I refer to Fortnightly against -- Corporation against United Artists Television and Teleprompter against CBS. Those were cases of community antenna television systems which went out and picked up signals from stations licensed to telecast motion picture films, relayed them to their own subscribers whom they charged to receive these films and they paid no royalty and no license, no royalty to or license form the owner of the copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.130" offset="9203858">Now that was infringement alleged under sections 1(c) and 1(d) which give the exclusive right to perform in public for profit and perform publicly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.183" offset="9240116">Now this Court held that it must really decide whether the CATV function fell upon the performers, the broadcaster side of the line or on the viewer's side of the line and it said essentially the CATV system no more than enhances the viewer's capacity to receive the broadcaster signal, and it used an analogy which I think is quite appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.666" offset="9341994">Indeed I think these two cases I am relying upon are much broader than anything I asked this Court to hold here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.426" offset="9369057">This Court said in Fortnightly, if an individual erected an antenna on a hill, strung a cable to his house and installed the necessary amplifying equipments, he would not be performing the programs, he received on his television set.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.831" offset="9426735">The only difference in the case of CATV is an antenna system is owned and operated not by its users but by an entrepreneur.</text>

            <text syncTime="2383.277" offset="9636446">The reason for that is this, we know, as a matter of law, the copy does not mean that the making of any copy violates the Copyright Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.341" offset="9696737">If it did, there would not have been a long practice agreed to of individual persons making copies for a variety of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.839" offset="9726725">So we know that one must construe the word copy, it is not a word that applies itself in a dictionary sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.885" offset="9762879">Therefore it seems to me, we have to draw a distinction much like that involved in Fortnightly which asked, is this like viewing or is it like sending, performing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.297" offset="9820557">Here I think we have to ask, is this like what the reader does properly under fair use or is it like publishing?</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.569" offset="11825612">But let us assume, along the lines of your question Mr. Chief Justice that such an agreement were possible or that such an agreement were imposed by rule of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.060" offset="11875662">The only thing that's going to happen immediately is, there would be a much greater burden of compliance upon libraries, not just the burden of the royalties which will be quite substantial because the numbers we're talking about as small, happen to be royalties for four journals in one library.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.153" offset="11951940">Now if you would add the 18,000 journals in thousands of libraries, we're talking about a large increase in the cost of medical research dissemination over the current practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.145" offset="11999901">In addition to that, there would be a very heavy burden of compliance by the libraries, as they have to check out and add administrative apparatus to count photocopying instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.178" offset="12044100">Now what that's going to mean is, that the holdings of libraries around this country, medical libraries are on this country, are going to be cut back sharply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.317" offset="12088613">The National Library of Medicine I'm sure can get an appropriation to pay whatever it costs and indeed the National Library of Medicine is now paying the higher price for petitioner's journals and has agreed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.308" offset="12132603">The National Library of Medicine is going to cut back on these journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.807" offset="12142634">But the National Library of Medicine is trying to encourage holdings and has been encouraging holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.595" offset="12161755">In fact they spent 12 and a quarter million dollars for grants for acquisitions to libraries around this country, much of which has been on subscriptions for petitioner's other journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.300" offset="12204596">So it's increasing the subscriptions out in regional and local libraries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.007" offset="12223404">This rule the petitioner seeks is going to increase the royalties greatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.664" offset="12246079">It's going to increase the burdens of compliance and cost in libraries.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.762" offset="12746376">The Courts have derived their power to evolve a doctrine of fair use from the constitutional value, the constitutional principle -- whether or not the Courts could second guess Congress' decision about what would promote rather than retard, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.055" offset="12827564">Certainly that's not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.453" offset="12841148">But when I talk about the harm to medical research and the lack of harm to the petitioner and after all there is nothing in this record that shows petitioner's loss of subscription except form hearsay in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.383" offset="12892871">We're talking (Inaudible)on this side of injury of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.792" offset="12906559">When I talk those two elements, I am talking the doctrine of fair use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.913" offset="12927039">The Court of Claims after all said it was moved in this case by the fact that holding for a petitioner would heavily damage medical research and secondly, the petitioner had shown no damage to itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.394" offset="12980955">Now it says these journals may go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.269" offset="12992449">There's nothing in the record about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.491" offset="12997360">In fact there's common sense, indicates that they won't, for the reasons we've talked about, for the reasons that photocopying doesn't substitute for subscriptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.326" offset="13076668">Mr. Chief Justice I think its about as demonstrable, if I may make the comparison as market definition in antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.351" offset="13128808">One looks at these two things and it is apparent in this industry, photocopies of single articles serve a different function, a different market than journal subscriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.161" offset="13180008">They complement, rather than substitute for each other and therefore, I think are indifferent markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.917" offset="13199026">I suppose, had this trial -- had petitioner taken this trial into the question of how much of him was injured, we might have a record on these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.533" offset="13241553">But we have here only petitioner's rather dire speculations about his future.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.241" offset="13344371">If they get this rule, we will then have a chaotic situation and negotiation with thousands of parties in interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.580" offset="13373733">If that negotiation comes out the way they want it to, we are going to have a dramatic impact on the peripheral journals, not upon petitioner's journals, petitioner's journals are not peripheral, libraries will continue to stock them, there's no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.475" offset="13429321">But, peripheral journals are going to find that library budgets have shrunk and then aren't going to be sold.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.274" offset="13452518">I take it what you're saying is that this can only be resolved -- this could not only be resolved by Congress doing something like what they have done with the mandatory copying of records.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="3356.458" offset="13529213">Or Congress doing something of that sort or perhaps making a solution to differentiate among the different interests involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.391" offset="13552933">I should have mentioned that the Library of Congress to its copyright office is now holding conferences including their national conference to comment on effort to arrive at norms in this quite complex situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.589" offset="13597759">Nor which may perhaps be translated into legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.919" offset="13611029">I should also say one other thing which I think shows how little petitioners are really talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.856" offset="13638823">There are 18,000 journals, there are over 400,000 volumes of journals, individual issues, volumes of journals in the NLM Holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.960" offset="13675186">Now in 1970, there were 93,000 articles photocopied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.732" offset="13706324">That is less than 1/4 of one request per volume of journals held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.250" offset="13728371">When you look at these things spread across the number of journals, sure there are men with microfilming constantly in one library but when you look at the universe of what they are copying from, and see the impact is negligible upon an individual journal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.982" offset="13823352">Yes, that's right Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I confess that I think that both of those breaths are internally consistent, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.688" offset="13858147">Is negligible -- I'm pointing out that it's negligible as an impact upon an individual journal by showing how thinly it is spread across this vast storehouse of medical information in journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.408" offset="13921050">It is crucial to individual researchers here and there who need a particular article in a far out, in an obscure peripheral magazine or in some other magazine or in a back number they have lost or in a specialty they don't belong to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.708" offset="13974235">For that research, it is crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.027" offset="13987506">At one end upon medical research is quite important, the effect of the other end upon subscriptions to journals is infinite testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.403" offset="14025017">If it exists, there is no showing in this record that it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.917" offset="14051035">I think I would quote form a Teleprompter decision about the fact that the detailed regulation of what's involved here cannot be solved really by litigation and a flat rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.101" offset="14111744">It requires something much more sensitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.422" offset="14121044">And I suggest, for the reasons I've given that both the law and the policy of the law, press to the conclusion that the Court of Claims opinion ought to be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan Latman</label>
            <text syncTime="3520.284" offset="14184469">Well if I may, I think that the Solicitor general's market potential test is a good test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.248" offset="14208397">I think it means that an antitrust competitor doesn't have to be out of business or bankrupt before he can come in and show that there's a certain potential, that's what the petitioner is trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.739" offset="14246327">That's what was recognized by the gentleman's agreement referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.983" offset="14259284">It said that it would not be fair to the author or publisher to make possible the substitution of the Photostats for the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.286" offset="14292511">Photostats is what they were dealing in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.327" offset="14300662">That's at page -- appendix 97 of the petitioner's appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.374" offset="14320828">Computer uses, which the Solicitor general referred to of course will follow a sequel perhaps, in other words we can't recover for any use if this Court takes the approach the Court of Claims did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.581" offset="14381746">The reason that we're suing in this case is because if the massive system is excused in this case, it's impossible to almost picture what is left of the proprietor's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.634" offset="14425945">And the important thing I think to remember is that we're not just talking about subscriptions, as some of the questions, Mr. Justice Blackmun's question emphasizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.727" offset="14462307">We're talking about all the traditional and new media.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.778" offset="14478503">The Government and its amici have conceded that we're talking about a new separate medium of distribution and we think that that medium should be encouraged, we don't want to stop it, we want reasonable compensation for it.</text>
