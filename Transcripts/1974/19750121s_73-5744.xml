            <text syncTime="8.900" offset="35527">This is a criminal case that comes here from the courts of Louisiana where the petitioner Taylor's conviction was affirmed by the Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.299" offset="77113">At the time of the conviction the statutes of the state provided that women would not be called for jury service unless they had filed a written declaration in advance if they desire to be subject to jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.376" offset="137404">The consequence was that hardly any women were called to serve on the criminal case juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.408" offset="169587">The issue here is whether this jury selection system comports with the Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments to be -- to the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.756" offset="203024">For the reasons we state in the opinion on file with the clerk, we hold that it does not and we consequently reverse the conviction of petitioner Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.608" offset="242416">The Chief Justice concurs in the judgment Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
